    # The FizzBuzz problem is a classic problem in programming interviews
    # It involves creating a list of numbers from 1 to n,
    # except for multiples of 3, which have the number 0,
    # multiples of 5, which have the number 1,
    # and multiples of 11, which have the number 2.

    # Here's a solution in Python:
    def fizz_buzz(n):
        # Initialize an empty list to store the output
        output = []
        # Loop over the numbers from 1 to n,
        # and for each number,
        # check if it's divisible by 3, 5, or 11
        # If so, add the number to the output list,
        # and set its value to 0, 1, or 2 respectively
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            if i % 3 == 0:
                output.append(0)
            elif i % 5 == 0:
                output.append(1)
            elif i % 11 == 0:
                output.append(2)
            else:
                output.append(i)
        # Return the output list
        return output
    return fizz_buzz(n)
