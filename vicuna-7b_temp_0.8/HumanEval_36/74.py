    # Implement this function to return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
    # You can use a combination of the `fizz_buzz_long` and `fizz_buzz_short` functions to achieve this.
    # For example:
    # fizz_buzz(n) = fizz_buzz_long(n) + fizz_buzz_short(n)
    # To test this function, create test cases and use the `assert` statement to check the output of the function.
    # For example, you could test the function with the following input:
    # assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0
    # assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2
    # assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3
    pass
