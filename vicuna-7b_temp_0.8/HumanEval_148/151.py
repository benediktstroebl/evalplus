def bf(planet1, planet2):
    '''
    There are eight planets in our solar system: the closerst to the Sun 
    is Mercury, the next one is Venus, then Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, 
    Uranus, Neptune.
    Write a function that takes two planet names as strings planet1 and planet2. 
    The function should return a tuple containing all planets whose orbits are 
    located between the orbit of planet1 and the orbit of planet2, sorted by 
    the proximity to the sun. 
    The function should return an empty tuple if planet1 or planet2
    are not correct planet names. 
    Examples
    bf("Jupiter", "Neptune") ==> ("Saturn", "Uranus")
    bf("Earth", "Mercury") ==> ("Venus")
    bf("Mercury", "Uranus") ==> ("Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn")
    '''
    # the bf(planet1, planet2) function uses the following logic:
    # 1. if the first planet is closer to the sun than the second planet,
    #    then the first planet is the closest planet
    # 2. if the second planet is closer to the sun than the first planet,
    #    then the second planet is the closest planet
    # 3. if the orbits of the two planets intersect,
    #    then the orbits of all planets between them are the closest
    # 4. if the orbits of the two planets do not intersect,
    #    then the orbits of the planets closest to the sun of the planets
    #    between them are the closest
