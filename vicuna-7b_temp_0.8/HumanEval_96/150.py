    """Implement a function that takes an non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n
    integers that are prime numbers and less than n.

    count_up_to(5) => [2,3]

The code above is a basic implementation of the algorithm. It uses a `for` loop to iterate from 2 to n and checks if the current number is prime. If it is prime, it is added to the result list. If the loop completes and the result list is not empty, it means that the current number is the last prime number less than n, so the result list is returned.

You can use the `bisect` module to check if a number is prime and then use a for loop to iterate from 2 to n and add the prime numbers to the result list.

Here is an example of how you can use `bisect` module:
