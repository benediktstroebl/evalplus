    """Task
    We are given two strings s and c, you have to deleted all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c
    then check if the result string is palindrome.
    A string is called palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.
    You should return a tuple containing the result string and True/False for the check.
    Example
    For s = "abcde", c = "ae", the result should be ('bcd',False)
    For s = "abcdef", c = "b"  the result should be ('acdef',False)
    For s = "abcdedcba", c = "ab", the result should be ('cdedc',True)

            s = s[:i] + s[i+1:l]

The above code is for the reverse delete function. The input of the function is two strings s and c. The function compares each character of s with c, and if it finds a match, it deletes that character from s and checks if the remaining string is a palindrome. If it is a palindrome, it returns the remaining string and True. If the remaining string is not a palindrome, it returns the remaining string and False.

Also, I added a method `get_palindrome_substring(s)` that returns the first non-overlapping palindrome substring in a given string s.

You can call the function like this:
