    # A more sophisticated way to solve this problem would be to convert s to a list and use a for loop to iterate through each character
    # Then use a dictionary to store the cases and their corresponding values

    # This is a simple approach to solve the problem
    # We will use the slicing operator [i] to get the i-th character of the string s
    # We will also use the in operator to check if the i-th character is a letter
    # If it is, we will reverse its case by converting it to upper or lower
    # We will use the str() method to convert the string to a new string
    # If the resulting string is empty, we will return an empty string
    # Otherwise, we will return the resulting string

    # We will use a list to store the reversed string
    # We will append each character of the string s to the list
    # We will use the [0] index to access the first character of the list
    # If the first character is a letter, we will reverse its case
    # If the first character is an empty space, we will append it to the list
