    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.
    """
    # Use a formula to calculate the number of collisions
    # Formula: 2 * n! / (n - k)! * 2^k, where k is the number of cars colliding
    # For example, for n = 3, the formula gives 2 * 6! / (6 - k)! * 2^k = 24
    # But for n = 4, the formula gives 2 * 7! / (7 - k)! * 2^k = 120, which is incorrect
    # Therefore, we need to use a different approach

    # Approach 1: Use matrix multiplication
    # Create a 2D matrix of size (n, n) where each cell represents the number of cars
    # moving in one direction that are within a distance of 1 of the corresponding cars
    # in the other direction
    # Then, multiply this matrix by a matrix of size (n, 1) where each element represents
    # the number of cars moving in one direction
    # The result will be the number of collisions
    # For example, for n = 3, the matrix representation would be:
    # [[2, 1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 1, 2]]
    # Multiplying this matrix by [1, 2, 3] (the number of cars moving in one direction)
    # would give [2, 6, 6], which is the number of collisions

    # Approach 2: Iterate through all possible combinations of car positions
    # and check if any two cars are colliding
    # This approach is less efficient but more intuitive
    # For example, for n = 3, the steps would be:
    # 1. Check if the first car (moving left to right) is colliding with the first
    #    car moving right to left (index 0)
    # 2. If not, move on to the next combination
    # 3. If so, add 1 to the number of collisions and move on to the next combination
    # 4. Repeat steps 1-3 for all possible combinations
    # ...

    # To make this approach more efficient, we can precompute all possible combinations
