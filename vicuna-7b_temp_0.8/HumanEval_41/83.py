    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.
    """
    # To count the number of collisions, we only need to keep track of the number of
    # cars that have moved left to right and the number of cars that have moved right to left.
    # We can use two integers x and y, where x = number of cars that have moved left to right
    # and y = number of cars that have moved right to left.
    # We start with x = n and y = 0, since all cars are initially moving right to left.
    # We then check if there's a collision by comparing x and y, and adding or subtracting
    # the number of cars that have moved from one side to the other.
    # If x = y = n, then there are no more collisions.

    # Implementation details:
    # We use two separate variables x and y to keep track of the number of cars that have moved
    # left to right and the number of cars that have moved right to left.
    # We start with x = n and y = 0, since all cars are initially moving right to left.
    # We then check if there's a collision by comparing x and y, and adding or subtracting
    # the number of cars that have moved from one side to the other.
    # If x = y = n, then there are no more collisions.

    # We start with a loop that goes from 1 to n.
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # We check if there's a collision by comparing x and y.
        if x == y:
            # If there's no collision, we output 0 and exit the function.
            return 0
        elif i % 2 == 0:
            # If the current car is moving right to left, we increment x by 1 and y by 0.
            x -= 1
            y = 0
        else:

            x -= 1
            y += 1

    # If we reach the end of the loop and there's still a collision, we output 1.
