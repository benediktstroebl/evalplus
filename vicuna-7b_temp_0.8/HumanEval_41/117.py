    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.

    # A possible approach is to use a combination of binary search and a backtracking algorithm.

    # Binary search: we can start by assuming that there are n/2 cars moving left to right
    # and that their total distance is twice the length of the road.
    # Then, we can check if any two cars are colliding in this case.
    # If not, we can narrow down the number of cars moving left to right by half.
    # We can repeat this process until we find the minimum number of collisions.

    # Backtracking: we can start by assuming that all n cars are moving right to left
    # and that their total distance is the length of the road.
    # Then, we can check if any two cars are colliding in this case.
    # If not, we can expand the set of cars moving right to left by adding the next car
    # and checking if any two cars are colliding in this case.
    # We can repeat this process until we find the maximum number of collisions.

    # A possible implementation of the backtracking algorithm:
    # Initialize total\_distance to the length of the road
    # Initialize total\_collisions to 0
    # Initialize current\_car to the first car
    # Initialize previous\_car to None

    # For each remaining car:
    #   If current\_car is the last car:
    #     Return total\_collisions
    #   If current\_car is different from previous\_car:
    #     Add current\_car to the set of cars moving right to left
    #     If current\_car is the first car:
    #         Set total\_distance to 0
    #         Set total\_collisions to total\_collisions + 1
    #         Set current\_car to the next car
    #         Set previous\_car to current\_car
    #     For each car in the set of cars moving right to left:
    #         If any two cars are colliding:
    #             Return total\_collisions
    #         If current\_car is different from any previously considered car:
    #             Add current\_car to the set of cars moving right to left
    #             Return total\_collisions
    # For each remaining car:
    #   If current\_car is
