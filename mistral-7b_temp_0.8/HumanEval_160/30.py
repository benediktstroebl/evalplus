    """
    Given two lists operator, and operand. The first list has basic algebra operations, and 
    the second list is a list of integers. Use the two given lists to build the algebric 
    expression and return the evaluation of this expression.

    The basic algebra operations:
    Addition ( + ) 
    Subtraction ( - ) 
    Multiplication ( * ) 
    Floor division ( // ) 
    Exponentiation ( ** ) 

    Example:
    operator['+', '*', '-']
    array = [2, 3, 4, 5]
    result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5
    => result = 9

    Note:
        The length of operator list is equal to the length of operand list minus one.
        Operand is a list of of non-negative integers.
        Operator list has at least one operator, and operand list has at least two operands.

    # TODO: Write your code here

    # # Your code goes here
    # # You need to evaluate the expression
    # # Then return the result

    # # Evaluate the expression
    # # For example, if the expression is "2 + 3 * 4 - 5", we need to evaluate the expression to get the result 9

    # # Input: operator, operand
    # # Output: result

    # # Pseudocode
    # # 1. Check if the list length is correct
    # # 2. Create a result variable to store the result
    # # 3. Iterate over the operator list
    # # 4. For each iteration, perform the operation based on the operator
    # # 5. Update the result variable
    # # 6. Return the result

    # # Example:
    # # 1. Input: operator = ["+", "*", "-"], operand = [2, 3, 4, 5]
    # # 2. Check if the list length is correct
    # # 3. Create a result variable to store the result
