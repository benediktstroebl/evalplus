  Smallest Change:

  Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic.

  A palindromic array is an array that is read the same backwards and forwards.
  In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

  Example:
  For example, given the array [1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6], you should return 4.
  To make the array palindromic, you can change the 3 to 5 or the 5 to 3, and you should change the 7 to 9 or the 9 to 7, and you should change the 4 to 6 or the 6 to 4.

  You can't change 6 to 8 or 8 to 6, since you'd have to change two values, so you'd have to do another change.

  You can't change the 9 to 8 and the 8 to 9, since you'd have to change two values, so you'd have to do another change.
