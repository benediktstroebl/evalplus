def closest_integer(value):
    '''
    Create a function that takes a value (string) representing a number
    and returns the closest integer to it. If the number is equidistant
    from two integers, round it away from zero.

    Examples
    >>> closest_integer("10")
    10
    >>> closest_integer("15.3")
    15

    Note:
    Rounding away from zero means that if the given number is equidistant
    from two integers, the one you should return is the one that is the
    farthest from zero. For example closest_integer("14.5") should
    return 15 and closest_integer("-14.5") should return -15.

    # use split

    # use int to turn the input into an integer

    # create a variable that is the input with the decimal removed

    # use abs()

    # use the remainder operator to see if there is a remainder

    # if there is a remainder, return the input as an integer

    # if there is no remainder

    # round the input up

    # subtract one

    # use the max function to see which integer is larger

    # return the max integer

    # round the input down

    # add one

    # use the max function to see which integer is larger

    # return the max integer

    # return the integer

    # it does not work for negative numbers like -14.5 or -15.3
