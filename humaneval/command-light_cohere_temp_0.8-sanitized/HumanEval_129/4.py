    Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N>=2) and a positive integer k, 
    each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the grid appears exactly once.

    You - The path of length k is defined as a list of integers in which each integer is equal to the value of a cell in the grid, 
    and the order of these integers is lexicographic.

    Examples:
        Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3
        Output: [1, 2, 1]

        Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1
