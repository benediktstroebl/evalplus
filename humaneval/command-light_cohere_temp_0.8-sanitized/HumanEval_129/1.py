    Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N>=2) and a positive integer k, 
    every integer in the range [1, N*N] inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.
    The minimum path of length k in the grid, you can start from any cell and 
    in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells, in other words, 
    you can go to cells which share an edge with your current cell.

    The path of length k is considered less than a path B (of length k) if after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B 
    go through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less than lst_B, in other words, 
    there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k) such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have
    lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].

    It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

    Return the minimum path of each grid, the integer k, and the list of values in the grid, 
    where each value is a tuple (row, column).
