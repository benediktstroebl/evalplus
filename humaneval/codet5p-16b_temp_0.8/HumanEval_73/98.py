    """
    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

    For example:
    smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0
    """

    """
    We will use a simple approach. We will change each element of the array by the difference between
    the value and its reverse. This way, we can find the minimum number of elements that need to be changed.

    For example, the array [1,2,3,4,3,2,2] is not palindromic, because we can change 1->9 and 2->9.
    We will change all the elements to the difference between the value and the reverse.
    """
    """
    Let's first think of the edge cases. If the array is empty or contains only one element, we can't change anything.
    If the array contains all same elements, we can change them all to any other number.

    More about the edge cases:

    """
    We'll use an array to store the value and the reversed value of each element.

    So, we'll create two new arrays, one to store the value of each element and one to store its reversed value.

    We'll iterate through the array and store the value and its reversed value in the two arrays.

    We will then compare the two arrays and get the minimum
