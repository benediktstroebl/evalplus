    The solution is to create a hash table that each key is a sum_so_far of the
    elements in the list (including duplicates). The hash table will keep track
    of all sums seen so far as well as the frequency of those sums (i.e., the
    number of times the sum has been seen). If there is a duplicate sums in the
    list, then we need to check whether this duplicate has a higher frequency
    in the list. If it does, then return True (i.e., the sum is 1 or 3).

    Before the loop starts, set up a dictionary to look up all sums so far.
    For each of the elements in the list, add them to the sum so far.
    If the element is not in the dictionary, then add it to the dictionary.
    If the sum is already in the dictionary, then increment the frequency
    of the sum. If the frequency of the sum is more than 1, then return
    True.

    Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the list.
