Here's a Python script that contains a function called even_odd_count, defined to solve the problem you've described:
```python
def even_odd_count(num):
    """Given an integer. return a tuple that has the number of even and odd digits respectively."""
    count_even = 0
    count_odd = 0
    temp = str(num)
    if temp[0] == '-':
        temp = temp[1:]
    for char in temp:
        if char > '9' or char < '0':
            if char == '-':
                continue
            else:
                count_odd += 1
        else:
            if int(char) % 2 == 0:
                count_even += 1
    return (count_even, count_odd)
```

This script defines a function called even_odd_count that takes in a single parameter, num, representing the integer for which we want to count the number of even and odd digits. The function first converts the integer to a string, handling the case where the number starts with a negative sign. It then iterates through the string, counting the number of even and odd digits. Charactors that are not digits are ignored.

The function returns a tuple (count_even, count_odd), where count_even is the number of even digits and count_odd is the number of odd digits in the integer num.

This solution will provide the desired output for the given examples, returning (1, 1) for the input -12 and (1, 2) for the input 123.
