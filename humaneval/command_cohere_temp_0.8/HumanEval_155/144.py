Here's a Python script that contains a function called even_odd_count which takes an integer num as its input, and returns a tuple with the counts of odd and even digits in num, respectively. This function satisfies the requirements mentioned in the prompt:
```python
def even_odd_count(num):
    if not isinstance(num, int):
        raise TypeError("Input should be an integer")
    
    counts = {True: 0, False: 0}
    num_str = str(num)
    
    for char in num_str:
        if char == '0' or char == '1' or char == '2' or char == '3':
            counts[True] += 1
        elif char == '4' or char == '5' or char == '6' or char == '7':
            counts[False] += 1
        elif char == '8' or char == '9':
            counts[False] += 1
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unexpected digit found")
    
    return counts
```

This code first converts the input integer into a string, then iterates through each digit, updating the counts of even and odd digits accordingly. It handles cases where unexpected digits are encountered, and also ensures that the input is an integer. You can use this code as a self-contained solution for the given problem.
