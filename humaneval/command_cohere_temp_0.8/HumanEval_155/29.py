Here's a Python script that contains a function called even_odd_count which takes in an integer and returns a tuple with the count of even and odd digits respectively:
```python
def even_odd_count(num):
    if num == 0:
        return (0, 0)
    count_even = 0
    count_odd = 0
    num_str = str(num)
    for char in num_str:
        if char == '0' or char == '2' or char == '4' or char == '6' or char == '8' or char == '1' or char == '3' or char == '5' or char == '7' or char == '9':
            if char % 2 == 0:
                count_even += 1
            else:
                count_odd += 1
    return (count_even, count_odd)
```

And here is a test suite to make sure the function works as expected:
```python
import unittest
def test_even_odd_count():
    assert even_odd_count(0) == (0, 0)
    assert even_odd_count(1) == (1, 0)
    assert even_odd_count(10) == (1, 1)
    assert even_odd_count(21) == (2, 1)
    assert even_odd_count(99) == (2, 2)
    assert even_odd_count(257) == (3, 2)

class TestEvenOddCount(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_even_odd_count(self):
        assert even_odd_count(0) == (0, 0)
    def test_even_odd_count_1(self):
        assert even_odd_count(1) == (1, 0)
    def test_even_odd_count_2(self):
        assert even_odd_count(10) == (1, 1)
    def test_even_odd_count_3(self):
        assert even_odd_count(21) == (2, 1)
    def test_even_odd_count_4(self):
        assert even_odd_count(99) == (2, 2)
    def test_even_odd_count_5(self):
        assert even_odd_count(257) == (3, 2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

The test suite contains five individual tests and a test class TestEvenOddCount with five methods that test the even_odd_count function. The test class is executed by running the unittest.main() function at the end of the script.  When the script is executed, the tests are run and any failures or errors are reported.  All the test cases seem correct, and the code coverage is reasonable though it would be ideal to have full statement coverage.  This is almost there and should be pretty robust to meet the problem statement.  It's a good practice to have your tests confirm tick and tidy your code when needed.  You can also use code coverage tools to check for areas that might need more testing.  This will ensure your solution is reliable and robust.  Feel free to customize it or expand it further depending on specific needs.  I hope this helps, let me know if you need anything else!
