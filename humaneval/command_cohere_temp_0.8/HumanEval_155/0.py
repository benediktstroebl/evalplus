Here's a Python script that contains a function called even_odd_count which takes an integer num as input and returns a tuple with the number of even and odd digits respectively. This function is designed to solve the problem you've described:
```python
def even_odd_count(num):
    if num == 0:
        return (0, 0)
    count_even = 0
    count_odd = 0
    temp_num = str(num)
    for i in temp_num:
        if i <= '9' and i >= '0':
            if i % 2 == 0:
                count_even += 1
            else:
                count_odd += 1
    return (count_even, count_odd)
```

To ensure that the solution is correct, the script also includes test cases that cover a variety of possibilities. These test cases verify that the function behaves as expected:
```python
# Testing Module
import unittest

class TestEvenOddCount(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_negative_input(self):
        self.assertEqual(even_odd_count(-12), (1, 1))

    def test_positive_input(self):
        self.assertEqual(even_odd_count(123), (1, 2))

    def test_zero_input(self):
        self.assertEqual(even_odd_count(0), (0, 0))

    def test_input_as_string(self):
        self.assertEqual(even_odd_count('45'), (1, 1))

    def test_input_as_mixed_string(self):
        self.assertEqual(even_odd_count('2a'), (1, 1))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
``` 

You can copy and paste this code into a Python environment or script to test and validate the solution. 

The `test_even_odd_count` class contains several test methods that check various scenarios, like testing negative numbers, positive numbers, zero, and inputs as strings, to ensure that the `even_odd_count` function behaves as expected for all types of inputs.
