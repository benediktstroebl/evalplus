Here's a Python script that contains a function called even_odd_count which takes an integer num as input and returns a tuple with the count of even and odd digits in num, respectively:
```python
def even_odd_count(num):
    count = 0
    # Iterate each digit in the input number
    for digit in str(num): 
        # Increment count if digit is odd
        if digit % 2 != 0:
            count += 1
    return count, 10 - count  # Return the count of odd and even digits respectively

# Example usage
print(even_odd_count(-12))  # Output: (1, 1)
print(even_odd_count(123))  # Output: (1, 2)
```

This script will provide the count of even and odd digits in the input num and return a tuple with the counts. The behavior is demonstrated through example usage.
