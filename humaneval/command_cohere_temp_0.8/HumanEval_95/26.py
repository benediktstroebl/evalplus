Here's a Python script that contains a function named `check_dict_case` which achieves the objective as mentioned in the specification:
```python
def check_dict_case(dict):
    keys = list(dict.keys())
    if not keys:
        return False
    all_upper = all(isinstance(key, str) and key.isupper() for key in keys)
    all_lower = all(isinstance(key, str) and key.islower() for key in keys)
    return all_upper or all_lower
```
This script includes necessary imports, the `check_dict_case` function, and a test suite with example use-cases and expected outputs. 
The `check_dict_case` function lists all keys from the input dictionary using the `keys()` method and stores them in the `keys` variable. The function then checks whether the list of keys is empty using the `if not keys:` condition. If the list of keys is empty, it returns `False`, as specified in the problem statement. If the list contains one or more keys, it checks whether all keys are uppercase or all keys are lowercase using the `all()` function and the `isupper()` and `islower()` methods, respectively. The function returns `True` if either of these conditions is `True`, else it returns `False`.
