This Python script defines a function `check_dict_case` that takes a single argument `dictn`, which is the dictionary required in the markdown problem statement. The function returns True if all keys are strings in lower case or all keys are strings in upper case, else it returns False. Also, the function returns False if the dictionary is empty or if the keys are not all strings (as per the problem's instructions).

The function is tested against various test cases to verify its correctness, these test cases are defined using a list of dictionaries in the `test_cases` variable. For each test case, the function is called with the dictionary as an argument, and the result is compared with the expected output (which is stored as the 'expected' key in each test case dictionary). Thus, the function is a self-contained solution to the problem described in the markdown code block.  This solution assumes that the dictionary being tested meets the criteria specified in the problem statement, and does not contain any additional functions or external dependencies. 

It is important to note that this is one possible solution, and there are alternative ways to solve this problem in Python, but the code provided is clean, simple, and efficient.  If there is a need for edge-case validation, extra tests could be added to validate the function's behavior in those scenarios.  This would be an exercise of testing the function against extreme inputs such as an empty dictionary, dictionary with very large strings as keys, and dictionaries where the keys or values are dictionaries or lists.  This would ensure that the function is robust and works as expected in all scenarios.  Such additional tests would make the function even more self-contained and robust.  This is often done as a best practice in software development to ensure that the function behaves as expected in scenarios that may not be anticipated by the original problem statement.  This makes the code more reliable and resilient to changes in the future.  Such additional tests could be added to a separate unittest module or embedded directly into the function if it is necessary to do so.  This would be the best approach to ensure that the function's behavior is thoroughly validated and tested.  This makes it easier to maintain and update the function in the future as the sole source of truth for its expected behavior.  Such additional tests also help to avoid bugs caused when the
