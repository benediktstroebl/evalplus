```python
def check_dict_case(dictn):
    if not dictn:
        return False
    for key in dictn:
        if not isinstance(key, str):
            return False
        if dictn[key].isupper() != key.isupper():
            return False
    return True
```
This function checks if all keys in the dictionary are lowercase or uppercase and returns True if so, returning False otherwise. It also checks if the dictionary is empty or if any of the keys are not strings. 
It utilizes the `isupper()` method to check if the key and value are both uppercase or lowercase. 
The `key.isupper()` check returns True if the key is uppercase, and `dictn[key].isupper()` returns True if the value associated with the key is also uppercase. 

The condition `dictn[key].isupper() != key.isupper()` returns True if the key and associated value are not both uppercase or lowercase, returning False otherwise. 

This problem can be solved using a single pass through the dictionary, utilizing the `isupper()` method to check key and value cases. It returns True if all keys are either all lowercase or all uppercase, and all key-value pairs are consistent.  It returns False if the dictionary is empty, any key is not a string, or if the case consistency rule is violated.  The given examples in the problem statement are also implemented as follows:
```python
def main():
    print(check_dict_case({"a":"apple", "b":"banana"}))  # Should print True
    print(check_dict_case({"a":"apple", "A":"banana", "B":"banana"}))  # Should print False
    print(check_dict_case({"a":"apple", 8:"banana", "a":"apple"}))  # Should print False
    print(check_dict_case({"Name":"John", "Age":"36", "City":"Houston"}))  # Should print False
    print(check_dict_case({"STATE":"NC", "ZIP":"12345"}))  # Should print True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
The function `main()` executes the examples' test cases, printing the return values of the `check_dict_case` function for each dictionary provided. 
The condition `if __name__ == "__main__":` checks if the script is run directly and if so, executes the `main()` function.  This approach allows incorporating the problem-solving function in larger projects, avoiding running the example tests unintentionally.  This is a best practice in software development to enable maintaining, understanding, and utilizing code pieces in larger projects.  The Python community can also leverage this practice to build and share utility libraries easily.  The main motive is to improve code organization and reusability, making it readable by simply glancing at the docstring at the top of the function.  As we focus on providing informative docstrings, the need for explicit separate test cases is minimized.  This approach aligns with the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, streamlining the solving problem in Python.
