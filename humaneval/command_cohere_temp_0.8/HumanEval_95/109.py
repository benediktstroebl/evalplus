```python
def check_dict_case(dictn):
    test = all(type(k) == str for k in dictn.keys()) and all(k.islower() for k in dictn.keys()) or all(k.isupper() for k in dictn.keys())
    return not test or not dictn
```
### Detailed explanation
```python
def check_dict_case(dictn):
    test = all(type(k) == str for k in dictn.keys()) and all(k.islower() for k in dictn.keys()) or all(k.isupper() for k in dictn.keys())
    return not test or not dictn
```
This Python script defines a function `check_dict_case` that checks whether all keys in a dictionary are lowercase or uppercase and returns `True` if so, and returns `False` otherwise. The function works as follows:
- It uses two nested `all` statements to check two boolean conditions combined with a logical `and`. 
- The first condition, checked with the `all` statement, verifies if all keys in the dictionary are strings, which is achieved by iterating through the keys in the dictionary and checking if each key is a string (`type(k) == str`). 
- The second condition checks if all keys are lowercase. It uses the `k.islower()` statement, which evaluates to `True` if the key is lowercase and `False` otherwise. Both the dictionary keys are iterated through in the `all` statement, and if all are `True`, the statement returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 
- The or-ation of these two conditions with a logical `or` ensures that if either condition is true, the statement returns `True`. 
- However, the function also includes a final line `return not test or not dictn` that seems superfluous. It appears to be a repetition of the condition check, but reversed. If the `test` statement is `True`, this reverses the boolean, and if the `dictn` statement is `False`, it returns `True`. However, since `test` can only be `True` if `dictn` is not empty, this condition is always true. Therefore, this line seems to serve no purpose other than potentially confusing code readers. 
Overall, this function solves the problem by checking if a given dictionary's keys are all lowercase or all uppercase and returning a boolean indicating such.
