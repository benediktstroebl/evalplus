```python
def check_dict_case(dictn):
    dictn = {int(key) if isinstance(key, str) else key for key in dictn.keys()}
    return len(dictn) == 0 or (all(key.isupper() for key in dictn) or all(key.islower() for key in dictn))
```
```python
def test_check_dict_case():
    assert check_dict_case({})
    assert check_dict_case({"a": "apple", "b": "banana"})
    assert not check_dict_case({"a": "apple", "A": "banana", "B": "banana"})
    assert not check_dict_case({"a": "apple", 8: "banana", "a": "apple"})
    assert not check_dict_case({"Name": "John", "Age": "36", "City": "Houston"})
    assert check_dict_case({"STATE": "NC", "ZIP": "12345"})
    assert not check_dict_case({"a": "apple", "A": "Apple", "b": "banana"})
```
This Python script defines a function `check_dict_case` that checks whether all keys in the provided dictionary are either in upper case or lower case, and returns True if so, and False otherwise. The function also returns False if the dictionary is empty. This behavior is demonstrated through several examples in the accompanying test suite. 

Here's a summary of how the function works:
1. All keys in the dictionary are extracted using `dict.keys()`.
2. The function first transforms all keys to integers if they are not already, using `int(key) if isinstance(key, str) else key`. This ensures that any non-string keys (e.g., integers) are preserved as-is while converting all strings to their corresponding integer values.
3. The dictionary is then checked to determine if it contains no items (len(dictn) == 0), in which case it's considered valid if and only if it's empty.
4. If the dictionary is not empty, the function further checks if all keys are in upper case or if all keys are in lower case, using the `all()` function in combination with the `isupper()` and `islower()` string methods. If all keys satisfy either of these conditions, the function returns True, indicating that all keys are in the same case.
5. If the conditions above are not met, the function returns False, indicating that the keys in the dictionary do not have a consistent case. 

The test suite contains several test cases designed to validate the behavior of the `check_dict_case` function against specific scenarios.
