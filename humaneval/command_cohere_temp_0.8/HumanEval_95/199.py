```python
def check_dict_case(dictn):
    if not dictn:
        return False
    booln = all(type(k) == str for k in dictn.keys()) and all(k.islower() for k in dictn.keys()) or all(k.isupper() for k in dictn.keys())
    return booln
```
### How It Works
The function first checks if the dictionary is empty, and if so, returns `False`. 

If the dictionary is not empty, it checks if all keys are strings using the `all` function and the `type` function along with the `isinstance` function as a shortcut.

If all keys are strings, it then checks if all keys are in lowercase using the `islower()` method. If not, it checks if all keys are in uppercase.

If either of these conditions is met, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`. 

### Test Cases
```python
assert check_dict_case({"a": "apple", "b": "banana"})
assert not check_dict_case({"A": "apple", "a": "apple", "B": "banana"})
assert not check_dict_case({"a": "apple", 8: "banana", "a": "apple"})
assert not check_dict_case({"Name": "John", "Age": "36", "City": "Houston"})
assert check_dict_case({"STATE": "NC", "ZIP": "12345"})
```
You can verify that the passed test cases correspond to the examples provided in the problem statement. 
If you wish to automate the testing process, a Python unit testing framework like `pytest` could be used to handle the test cases. 

This would generate automated tests that can be executed to ensure the reliability of the function over time. 
For more complex applications, a continuous integration (CI) tool could also be useful for automatically testing code whenever changes are made. 

This would help ensure the reliability of the function, even when updates are pushed by multiple developers. In this case, the `check_dict_case` function can serve as a ` pytest` test itself as it outputs boolean values, and therefore can be used directly:
```bash
pytest -v
``` 
The `-v` flag would increase verbosity to display all consecutive test passes or failures, indicating the status of the tests and helping to identify potential issues that may arise during execution.
