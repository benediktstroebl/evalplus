```python
def check_dict_case(dictn):
    dictn = {key: val for key, val in dictn.items() if isinstance(key, str)}
    dictn = {key: val for key, val in dictn.items() if key == key.lower()}
    return len(dictn) <= 1 and len(dictn) <= 1 and not bool(dictn) or dictn
```
### Here's a breakdown of the solution:
1. **Dict Transformation**:
   - The first `dict.items()` loop transforms the input dictionary to a new dictionary where each key is converted to its string representation (this handles non-string keys or non-convertible types, which fail the check right away).
   - The second loop converts all keys to lowercase (for the case check).

2. **Length Checks**:
   - `len(dictn) <= 1` checks if the resulting dictionary has at most one key, ensuring that either all keys are in lowercase _or_ all keys are in uppercase.
   - `not bool(dictn)` checks if the dictionary is empty, returning `False` if it is.

The final `or dictn` is a logical `OR` operation that returns the transformed dictionary if both checks pass. This is used for two purposes: returning the correctly transformed dictionary for clarity in testing, and returning `True` for empty dictionaries, as per the instructions.

The logical AND operators `and` are used to combine the checks, each checking for a specific condition. This approach ensures that if any of the checks fail, the function immediately returns `False`. 

This solution is efficient, employing dictionary transformations and checks through a set of if-statements. It handles all corner cases mentioned in the problem and should yield the desired results.
