```python
def check_dict_case(dictn):
    test = True
    if not dictn:
        return False
    for key in dictn:
        if type(key) != str:
            return False
        if len(key) > 1 and key.lower() != key and key.upper() != key:
            return False
    return test
```
The provided Python script defines a function check_dict_case that takes a single argument, dictn, which is the dictionary to be evaluated. The function first checks if the dictionary is empty, and if so, it returns False, as there are no keys to evaluate. Next, the script iterates over the keys of the provided dictionary. During each iteration, the function checks if the current key is a string and if it is more than one character long. If so, it checks whether the key is also equal to its lowercase and uppercase equivalents. If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns False. If all the keys satisfy either of the conditions (being lowercase or uppercase), the function returns True. Overall, the script evaluates whether a given dictionary has all keys in either lowercase or uppercase and handles additional edge cases.
