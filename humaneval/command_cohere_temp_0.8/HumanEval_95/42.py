                {"input": {"a":"apple", 8:"banana", "a":"apple"}, "output":False},
                {"input": {"Name":"John", "Age":"36", "City":"Houston"}, "output":False},
                {"input": {"STATE":"NC", "ZIP":"12345"}, "output":True},

The problem can be solved by following these steps:
1. Check if the dictionary is empty or not.
2. If the dictionary is empty, return False.
3. If the dictionary is not empty, check if all keys are of type string.
4. If all keys are not of type string, return False.
5. Otherwise, check if all keys are in either upper case or lower case.
6. If all keys are in either upper case or lower case, return True.
7. Otherwise, check if all values of the dictionary are the same as the keys.
8. If all values are the same as the keys, return True. 
9. Otherwise, return False. 

The `check_dict_case()` function adheres to these steps and returns the appropriate result based on the given dictionary. The function also includes tests in the `tests` list, which verify its correctness against different scenarios described in the problem statement. Each test case in the list has an input dictionary and the expected output truthiness. By using the `assert` statement, each test case checks if the output of the `check_dict_case()` function matches the expected output.  This way, we can ensure that the function behaves as expected for all inputs.  This approach allows you to validate the correctness of the function step-by-step and gain confidence in the solution's reliability.  If any of the assertions fail, the script will raise an error, indicating which test case failed and providing a helpful error message.  This enables you to identify any gaps or errors in the function's implementation and take appropriate steps to fix them.  In this way, testing is a critical step in the software development process, especially for algorithmic problems, as it ensures that the code behaves as expected and provides a solid guarantee of correctness.  This is especially important in large codebases or when collaborating with others, as automated tests provide a safety net and speed up the development and debugging process.  In this case, the test cases are encapsulated in the same script, but they can also be separated into different test files or even integrated with a continuous integration (CI) system for automated testing during the development process.  This way, you can ensure that the function remains correct throughout the development process, even after modifications or updates to the codebase.  As a result, you can have confidence in the reliability of your solution and focus on solving other problems
