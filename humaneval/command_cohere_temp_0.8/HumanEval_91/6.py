```python
def is_bored(S):
    """
    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".
    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.
    """
    boredoms = 0
    for sentence in S.split('.'):
        sentence = sentence.strip('!?')
        if sentence.startswith('I'):
            boredoms += 1
    return boredoms
```

This approach splits the input string on '.' character, strips excessive punctuation from each sentence fragment, and checks if the resulting string starts with 'I' to count boredoms in the given text.
