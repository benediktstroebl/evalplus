Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def is_bored(S):
    bored = 0
    for sentence in S.split('.'):
        sentence = sentence.strip()
        if sentence.startswith('I') and sentence.find('!') == -1 and sentence.find('?') == -1:
            bored += 1
    return bored
```

This script defines a function `is_bored` that takes a string as an input and counts the number of boredoms in the string. The function iterates over each sentence using the `split()` method, and for each sentence, it checks if the sentence starts with the word 'I' and does not contain an exclamation mark or a question mark. If the conditions are met, it increments the count of boredoms by 1. Ultimately, the function returns the total count of boredoms in the provided string.
