Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def is_bored(S):
    count = 0
    for sentence in S.split('.'):
        sentence = sentence.strip()
        if sentence.startswith('I') and sentence.find('!') == -1 and sentence.find('?') == -1:
            count += 1
    return count
```

This script splits the input string S into a list of sentences based on the punctuation marks '.'. Then, it iterates over each sentence and checks if it starts with the word 'I'. If it does, and there are no exclamation marks '!' or question marks '?' in the sentence, the boredom count is incremented. Finally, the function returns the total count of boredoms in the input string.
