```python
def is_bored(S):
    """
    Count the number of boredoms in the given string.
    A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".
    Sentences are assumed to be delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.
    """
    boredoms = 0
    for sentence in S.split('.'):
        sentence = sentence.strip('!?')
        if sentence.startswith('I'):
            boredoms += 1
    return boredoms
```

This approach splits the input string on '.' characters, strips off potential sentence-ending characters, and checks if the resulting sentence starts with the word 'I'. If so, it increments the counter. Finally, it returns the count of boredoms.
