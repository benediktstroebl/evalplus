Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def is_bored(S):
    bored = 0
    for sentence in S.split('.'):
        sentence = sentence.strip('!?')
        if sentence.startswith('I'):
            bored += 1
    return bored
```

This function iterates through each sentence and uses `startswith()` to check if the sentence starts with 'I'. The counter is incremented for each sentence that starts with 'I' and when it encounters '!?', it resets the sentence. The function returns the total count of boredoms in the given input string.
