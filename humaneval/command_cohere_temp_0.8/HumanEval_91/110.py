```python
def is_bored(S):
    bored = 0
    for sentence in S.split('.'):
        sentence = sentence.strip()
        if sentence.startswith('I'):
            bored += 1
    return bored
```

This Python script defines a function called `is_bored` that takes a string as an input parameter, splits the string on the decimal mark to have separate sentences and strips extra spaces from each sentence. The function then checks if each sentence starts with the word 'I', and if it does, it counts the sentence as a boredom and adds one to the counter. Finally, the function returns the number of sentences that are boredom.
