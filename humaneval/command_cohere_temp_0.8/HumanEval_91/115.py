```python
def is_bored(S):
    """
    Count the number of boredoms in the given string.
    A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".
    """
    boredoms = sum(1 for sentence in S.split('. ') if sentence.startswith('I'))
    return boredoms
```

This function leverages Python's sum function along with the split function to analyze sentence structures and count 'boredoms'. 

To understand the logic therein, consider this breakdown:
1. **Split Structure**: The split('. ')(S) operation divides the input string into a list of substrings. The '.' and ' ' ensure sentences are individually separated and that spaces are considered bounds.
2. **Sentence Checking**: The sum(1 for sentence if ...)(sentence.startswith('I')) part of the code uses a generator expression. It iterates over each sentence and checks if the sentence starts with the word 'I'. The 1 is an implicit increment, and the sum function aggregates these counts into a total.
3. **Final Output**: Given the explained logic, the function finally returns the total count of 'boredoms' in the provided string. 

This function encapsulates the complete solution to the problem in a self-contained manner. You can import this function and utilize it to solve the problem without any external dependencies or further code.
