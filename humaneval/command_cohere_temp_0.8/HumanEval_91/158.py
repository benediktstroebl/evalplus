```python
def is_bored(S):
    boredom_count = sum(1 for sentence in S.split('.') + S.split('?') + S.split('!') if sentence.startswith('I'))
    return boredom_count
```

This script splits the input string into sentences based on common delimiters ('.', '?', '!') and then counts the number of sentences that start with the word 'I'. Finally, it returns this count, representing the number of 'boredoms' in the given input string. 

The problem statement also includes test cases; however, providing them here would be redundant, as the code above is self-explanatory and already reflects the nature of test cases. If you would like to test this script with sample inputs, you can experiment with different strings and observe the corresponding outputs.
