```python
def is_bored(S):
    bored = 0
    for sentence in S.split('.'):
        sentence = sentence.strip()
        if sentence.startswith('I'):
            bored += 1
    return bored
```

This Python script divides the input string by the punctuation marks ``.` and analyzes each sentence to check if it starts with the word `I`. If it does, it counts it as a boredom. Ultimately, it sums up the number of boredoms and returns the count.
