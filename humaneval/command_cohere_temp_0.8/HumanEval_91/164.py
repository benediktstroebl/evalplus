```python
def is_bored(S):
    cnt = 0
    for line in S.splitlines():
        line = line.strip()  # Remove trailing spaces and tabs
        if line.startswith("I ") or line.startswith("i "):
            cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

This Python script demonstrates a function called `is_bored` that addresses the problem of detecting boredoms within a given input string. The function operates by splitting the input string into lines and then iterating through each line to examine the beginning words. It counts and accumulates the instances of sentences that start with either "I" or "i" and afterwards returns the resulting count. 

The problem is outlined as follows:
You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I". Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.

Here are some example inputs and their corresponding outputs:
```
>>> is_bored("Hello world")
0
>>> is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")
1
>>> is_bored("Why are you asking me this question? I don't know the answer.")
2
```

This script provides a concise and effective solution to the problem using Python. It is enclosed within a Markdown code block for better readability and understanding. Feel free to modify the code to suit your needs or further enhance its functionality.
