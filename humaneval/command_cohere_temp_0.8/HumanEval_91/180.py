```python
def is_bored(S):
    bored = 0
    for sentence in S.split('.'):
        sentence = sentence.strip('!?')
        if sentence.startswith('I'):
            bored += 1
    return bored
```

This Python script defines a function called `is_bored` that takes a string as an input parameter, splits it into sentences based on the punctuation marks ".", "!", and "?" and counts the number of sentences that start with the word "I". The function returns the total count of such sentences. 

The expected behavior is for the function to correctly count the number of sentences that start with the word "I" and return the total count, matching the given examples. Adjust the newline and indentation accordingly if copying and pasting into a .py file.
