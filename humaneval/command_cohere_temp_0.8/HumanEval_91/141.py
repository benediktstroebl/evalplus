```python
def is_bored(S):
    bored = 0
    for sentence in S.split('.'):
        sentence = sentence.strip()
        if sentence.startswith('I'):
            bored += 1
    return bored
```

This approach splits the input string by periods to individualize sentences, and then trims any leading and trailing spaces from each sentence. If the trimmed sentence starts with the word "I", it is counted as a boredom. Finally, the function returns the total count of boredoms.
