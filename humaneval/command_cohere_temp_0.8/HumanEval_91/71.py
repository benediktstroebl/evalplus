```python
def is_bored(S):
    """
    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".
    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.
    """
    boredoms = 0
    for sentence in S.split('.'):
        sentence = sentence.strip('!?')
        if sentence.startswith('I'):
            boredoms += 1
    return boredoms
```

This approach splits the input string on punctuation that might end a sentence, then checks if each resulting substring starts with the letter "I". This should produce the correct count of boredoms in the given input string. Let me know if you'd like me to explain any part of this code in more detail! I can also provide additional examples of how the function behaves with different inputs.
