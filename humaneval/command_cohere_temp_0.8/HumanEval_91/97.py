```python
def is_bored(S):
    bored = 0
    for sentence in S.split('.'):
        sentence = sentence.strip()
        if sentence.startswith('I') and sentence.find('!') == -1 and sentence.find('?') == -1:
            bored += 1
    return bored
```

This approach splits the input string by the sentence markers ('.' punctuation mark) and then checks each sentence if it starts with the word "I" and if it does not end with the exclamation mark '!' or question mark '?'. 

Here is a basic test suite to test the function:
```python
# test case one
assert is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather") == 1

# test case two
assert is_bored("Hello world") == 0

# test case three
assert is_bored("? I am confused. Is it a rabbit? It is!.") == 2
``` 

To further improve the accuracy of the function, one could consider ending the sentences after certain words like 'thanks', 'regards', 'etc'. 
Although, the current code covers most boredom sentences in plain English. 
This could be further enhanced by using a more sophisticated method to detect sentence boundaries instead of just relying on '.'.
