Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def is_bored(S):
    cnt = 0
    for sentence in S.split('.'):
        sentence = sentence.strip()
        if sentence.startswith('I'):
            cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

This script defines a function `is_bored` that takes a string as an input and counts the number of boredoms in the string. The function splits the string into a list of sentences using the sentence delimiter '.' and iterates over them. It checks if each sentence starts with the word 'I', and if so, it increments the counter. The function then returns the total count of boredoms.
