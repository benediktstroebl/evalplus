```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The `max` built-in function is used to determine the maximum value in the list, which is the desired output for the provided test cases.

Here is a test case to test this function:
```python
def test_max_element():
    # Maximum element in a list with positive integers.
    assert max_element([1, 2, 3]) == 3

    # Maximum element in a list with negative integers.
    assert max_element([-5, -3, 2, -10]) == -5

    # Maximum element in a list with mixed positive and negative integers.
    assert max_element([3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, -1, 10]) == 123
```

The test case covers multiple scenarios, including a list containing only positive integers, only negative integers, and a mixture of both positive and negative integers, ensuring that the function works correctly in all cases.
