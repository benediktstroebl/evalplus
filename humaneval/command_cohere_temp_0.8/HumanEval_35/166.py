```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list of elements.

    Returns:
        int or float: The maximum element in the list.
    """
    # Initialize the maximum element to the first element of the list
    max_element_ = l[0]
    # Iterate over the list and update the maximum element if a larger element is encountered
    for num in l:
        if num > max_element_:
            max_element_ = num
    # Return the maximum element
    return max_element_
```

The function takes a list `l` as input and iterates over it, initially assuming the first element to be the maximum element. During the iteration, if a larger element is encountered, the variable holding the maximum element is updated. Finally, the maximum element is returned. The unit tests provided in the problem statement are straightforward and would ensure the correctness of the provided function.  This approach is efficient and has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list `l`, making it an optimal solution for this problem.
