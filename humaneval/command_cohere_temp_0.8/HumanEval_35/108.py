```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.

    :param l: A list of integers.
    :return: The maximum element in the list.
    """
    return max(l)
```

This code provides an improved solution to the problem. The function `max_element` takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element using the `max` function. This is a more straightforward approach and solves the problem correctly. 

This solution is more direct and maintains the readability and efficiency of the original solution. It correctly finds the maximum element in the list, as demonstrated by the test cases. 

I hope this helps provide an effective solution to your problem. Let me know if you would like me to explain any part of the code in more detail or provide additional insights.
