```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    """
    return max(l)
```

This code defines a Python function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. Inside the function, it uses the `max()` function to determine the maximum value in the input list and returns it. The function is designed to find the highest value present in any list of integers provided to it as input.

The tests that this code passes are:
```python
def test_max_element():
    """Test the max_element function.
    """
    # Single max element
    assert max_element([3]) == 3

    # Multiple elements in the list
    assert max_element([1, 2, 3]) == 3
    assert max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]) == 123
```

These tests verify that the `max_element` function correctly identifies the maximum element in different scenarios, including lists with single elements and lists with multiple elements. 

A docstring is also included at the beginning of the code snippet, which provides a helpful description of the function's purpose and behavior, making it easier for others to understand and use the code.

This code is a demonstration of Python's robustness and simplicity in handling real-world coding problems, especially when it comes to manipulating lists and finding maximum or minimum values within them.
