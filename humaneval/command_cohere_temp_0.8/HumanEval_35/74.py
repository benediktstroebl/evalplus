```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The `max` built-in function is used to determine the maximum value in the list, which is the desired output for the provided test cases.

This solution is efficient and uses a built-in function, which makes it optimized for performance and simplicity.
