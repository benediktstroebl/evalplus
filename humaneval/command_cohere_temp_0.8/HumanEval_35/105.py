```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The `max` built-in function is used to find the maximum value in the list. 

The function is designed to work for any list input, regardless of the data type of the list elements. 

The function returns the maximum element in the list, which represents the highest value present in the input list. 

This solution is straightforward and efficient, as it leverages Python's built-in `max` function to directly identify the maximum element in the list. 

If you would like to test this script, you can create a file called `test_max_element.py` and add the following code:
```python
def test_max_element():
    assert max_element([1, 2, 3]) == 3
    assert max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]) == 123
```

Lastly, to run these tests, you can use the following command:
```python
python test_max_element.py
```

Please note that you will need to have Python installed on your system to run this command.
