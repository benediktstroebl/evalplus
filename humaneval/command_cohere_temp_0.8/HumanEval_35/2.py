```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Returns the maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The function uses the `max` function, which returns the maximum value from a list of numbers, to find the maximum element in the input list `l`. 

The function is self-contained, meaning it does not rely on any external variables or functions, other than those explicitly given in the function signature. It is also implicitly tested in the problem statement, as it passes both example tests provided.
