```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
```

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list using the `max` function. The function is designed to work with any valid list input, and the outcome is an integer representing the highest value in the list. 

The docstring at the beginning of the code provides a description of the function's purpose, and it is concise and clear, making it easier for developers to understand the function's usage and functionality. 

To make the code more test-friendly, you can add test cases in the same file to verify the function's behavior against specific examples. Here's an example:
```python
def test_max_element():
    assert max_element([1, 2, 3]) == 3
    assert max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]) == 123
    assert max_element([0, 0, 0, 0]) == 0
    assert max_element([-10, -10, -5, -20, -50, -100, -200]) == -10
    assert max_element([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]) == 100
```

In this test suite, we have several test cases that cover different scenarios, including positive and negative lists, lists with and without duplicates, and lists with a range of values. By executing these tests, we can verify that the `max_element` function behaves as expected, making it a valuable tool for max element identification in various list configurations. 

This approach provides a comprehensive and adaptable solution to the problem, making it a useful resource for developers facing similar challenges.
