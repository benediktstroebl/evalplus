```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The `max` built-in function is used to determine the maximum value in the list. 

This solution is straightforward and efficient, as it utilizes Python's built-in `max` function to directly identify the maximum element in the list. It is important to note, however, that this method may not be the most efficient option for extremely large lists that may consume a lot of memory. In such cases, a more tailored approach might be preferable.
