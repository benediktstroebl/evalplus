```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function `max_element(l)` that finds the maximum element in a given list `l` using the `max()` function. 

The "Maximum Element in a List" problem is a common coding challenge that tests a candidate's basic understanding of list manipulation and optimization. 

It's a simple problem, but it's a common task in many programming contexts, and therefore, it's an important one for developers to be able to solve efficiently. 

It's also a straightforward problem to introduce testing and documentation, which are fundamental skills for software development.
