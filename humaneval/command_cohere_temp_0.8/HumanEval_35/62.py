```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The `max` built-in function is used to determine the maximum value in the list, which is the element that appears most frequently in the list or is the largest among all elements.  This function provides an elegant and efficient solution to find the maximum element in a list, making it helpful for various scenarios where you need to find the highest value within a dataset.  It also passes the given tests, as it produces the expected output for the test cases.
