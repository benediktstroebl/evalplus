```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list using the `max` function. 

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```python
print(max_element([1, 2, 3]))  # Outputs: 3
``` 

And here is the anticipated output of the example: 
```
3
``` 

This function will work correctly for any list input, returning the highest value in the list, as demonstrated by the two examples provided in the prompt. 
Feel free to use this function in your code to determine the maximum element in any list you provide.
