```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.

    :param l: A list of integers.
    :return: The maximum element in the list.
    """
    return max(l)
``` 

This code provides an optimized Python function that finds the maximum element in a given list of integers. It uses the `max()` function, which is built into Python, to efficiently identify the highest value in the list, making it a reliable and concise solution.
