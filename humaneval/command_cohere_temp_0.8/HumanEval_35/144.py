```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    
    Args:
        l (list): List of elements.
        
    Returns:
        int: Maximum element in the list.
    """
    return max(l)
```

The function max_element takes a list l as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The max() function takes a list as input and returns the maximum element in that list, which is the desired result.
