```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    
    Args:
        l (list): List of elements.
    
    Returns:
        int: Maximum element in the list.
    """
    return max(l)
```

This Python script defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The function uses the `max` function to compare and return the highest value in the input list. 

The tests were not provided in the initial request, if you provide the tests, I can validate the function against them.
