```python
def max_element(l: list):
    max_element = max(l)
    return max_element
```

The max() function takes the list as an argument and returns the maximum value present in the list. This function will return the maximum element in the list. 

This code passes the given tests:
```python
>>> max_element([1, 2, 3])
3
>>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
123
```

But, this code snippet might not be the most efficient solution for large data sets. Finding the maximum element in a list using the max() function is linear performance, and there is room for improving its efficiency especially for large lists. 

Would you like me to suggest any performance improvements?
