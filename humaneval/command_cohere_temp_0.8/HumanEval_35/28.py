```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        int or float: The maximum element in the list.
    """
    if not l:
        return None
    max_el = max(l)
    return max_el
```

This function takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. It works for both positive and negative integers and also handles empty lists, as the maximum of an empty list is inherently None. 

The tests mentioned above would depend on the testing framework and test-case specifics and are not provided in the original problem statement. However, with a self-contained function, they should be easy to add and run using standard testing libraries such as `unittest` in Python.  If you would like to provide additional context or specifics regarding the tests or the desired outcome, I'd be happy to adjust my response accordingly.
