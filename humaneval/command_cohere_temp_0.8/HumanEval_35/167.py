```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Returns the maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The function uses the `max` function to compare and return the highest value in the list. 

Would you like to know more about the `max` function or anything else related to maxing elements in Python? Feel free to ask, and I will be happy to help!
