```python
def max_element(l: list):
    max_element = max(l)
    return max_element
```

The function 'max_element' takes a list `l` as an input, and uses the `max` built-in function to determine the maximum value in the list. The function will return the maximum value in the list.

This solution follows the `YAGNI` (You Ain't Gonna Need It) principle, which suggests that a simpler solution is preferred if it fulfills the requirements. 

To test this function, you can call it with different lists and compare the results with the expected maximum values. 
For example:
```python
 pytest.test_max_element(max_element, [1, 2, 3], 3)
 pytest.test_max_element(max_element, [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10], 123)
```

In this test script, `pytest.test_max_element` is a placeholder for a testing function that would typically use `pytest` framework features like `pytest.fixture` to organize and execute tests. 

Note: The solution assumes that the list contains at least one element. If the list is empty, the function will throw a `TypeError` because `max` also expects at least one element to handle. 

Overall, this is a clean and efficient solution that handles the problem in a straightforward manner, in alignment with the `YAGNI` principle.
