```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    
    Args:
        l (list): List of elements.
    
    Returns:
        int or float: Maximum element in the list.
    """
    if not l:
        raise ValueError("Input list is empty")
    
    max_el = max(l)
    return max_el
```

The function employs the built-in `max` function to identify the maximum element in the input list. It is important to note that the `max` function assigns the maximum value to both the output and the `max_el` variable, thus guaranteeing that the maximum value is returned, even if the list contains negative elements. 

This approach allows the code to handle both simple and complex use cases, including negative elements and empty lists, ensuring consistent functionality across different scenarios. 

Here are some examples of how you might call the function with different input lists:
```python
max_element([1, 2, 3])  # Output: 3
max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])  # Output: 123
max_element([])  # Error: ValueError: Input list is empty
``` 

The first example above demonstrates how the function successfully identifies the maximum element in a list of positive integers. The second example shows the function's ability to handle a list that includes both positive and negative numbers, correctly identifying the maximum value, which is 123 in this case. 

In the third example, we introduce an empty list, resulting in a ValueError since the list is empty, and the function is not able to determine a maximum element.  This ensures the code gracefully handles various input scenarios while producing accurate results.
