```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])
    3
    >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    123
    """
    return max(l)
```
This Python script defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The function uses the `max` function to compare and return the highest value in the list.

The script includes example test cases in the function signature, demonstrating the function's behavior and expected output. These test cases, indicated by the `>>> `symbol, allow you to validate the function's correctness against specific input lists. 

Overall, this code provides a straightforward and effective solution to find the maximum element in a given list.
