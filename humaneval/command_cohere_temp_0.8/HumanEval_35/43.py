```python
def max_element(l: list):
    max_element = max(l)
    return max_element
```

The max() function takes the list l as input and returns the maximum value present in the list. This function will correctly identify the maximum element in any valid input list. 

The TDD approach is not included in this solution but is implemented in the following steps:
1. Writing a failing test that describes the desired behavior without implementing it.
2. Running the test suite to ensure that the new test fails (verifying the test is failing correctly).
3. Implementing the code that achieves the desired functionality, only writing enough code to make the test pass.
4. Finally, clean up any unnecessary code (comments, auxiliary variables, etc.) from the code block.

These steps ensure confidence in the function's correctness while keeping the implementation minimal. 
Let me know if I have misunderstood the steps, or if you'd like to further discuss Test-Driven Development!  Please provide feedback on this code or any further questions on TDD, and I will be glad to assist!
