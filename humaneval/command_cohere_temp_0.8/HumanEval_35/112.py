```python
def max_element(l: list):
    max_element = max(l)
    return max_element
```

The function 'max_element' takes a list `l` as an input, and uses the `max` function to determine the maximum element in the list. It returns this maximum element. 

This approach is straightforward and efficient, directly yielding the maximum element without any additional complexity or considerations. It is important to note that Python considers `-inf` to be the lowest value. Thus, lists that include negative values may return `-inf` as the maximum element. 

The script meets the provided testing criteria:
```python
def test_max_element():
    assert max_element([1, 2, 3]) == 3
    assert max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]) == 123

test_max_element()
```

This specific implementation is not versatile and limited as it only handles the default sorting behavior of Python, which is not always appropriate for all scenarios. However, it excels in terms of performance due to its direct approach.
