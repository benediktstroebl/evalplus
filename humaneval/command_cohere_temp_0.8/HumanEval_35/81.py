```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Returns the maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The function uses the `max` function, also known as `built-in_function_or_method` to find the maximum element in the list. 

The function is self-contained, meaning it does not rely on any external variables or functions other than those explicitly required to solve the problem. 

It is important to note that the function assumes that the list `l` contains at least one element. If the list is empty, the function will trigger a `ValueError` as the `max` function called on an empty list is invalid.  If you pass an empty list `[]` to the `max_element()` function, you'll get back a `ValueError` error.
