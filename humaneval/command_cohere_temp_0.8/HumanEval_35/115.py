```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Returns the maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The `max` built-in function is used to determine the maximum value in the list, which is the output of the `max_element` function. 

The docstring at the top of the code explains the purpose of the function, and the `->` symbol in the comment indicates that the return value of the function is the int type. 

If this code is placed in a markdown code block, the code will be executed independently, and the result will be the maximum element in the list.
