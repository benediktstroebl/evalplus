```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
```

This code defines a Python function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. Inside the function, it uses the `max()` function to determine the highest value in the input list and returns it. The function is designed to work for any list input, regardless of the data type of the list elements, as the `max()` function automatically handles a variety of data types, including integers, floats, strings, and other elements. 

The inline docstring provides information about the purpose of the function and its behavior, and the example usage demonstrates how to use the function with example inputs and shows the expected output.

If you are attempting to test the function to verify that it behaves as expected, you can use a testing framework like pytest, as shown in the subsequent code:
```python
# test_max_element.py
import pytest

def test_max_element():
    """Test max_element function."""
    # Empty list
    assert max_element([]) == None

    # Single element list
    assert max_element([1]) == 1

    # Multiple elements
    assert max_element([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 5

    # Negative numbers
    assert max_element([-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]) == -1

    # Mixed types and values
    assert max_element([1, -1, 1, -2, 3, -5, "aa", "bb", "cc"]) == "cc"
```

In the test code, the `pytest` framework is utilized to perform various tests on the `max_element` function in order to verify its correctness. Each test case is defined using the `test_` function, which encapsulates a specific scenario that we want to examine.

This approach allows you to validate your function's behavior against numerous cases, guaranteeing that it performs as expected and produces the correct output for each set of inputs.

To run these tests, you can install and utilize the `pytest` tool as follows:
```bash
pip install pytest
pytest test_max_element.py
```

This will execute the test suite and provide you with comprehensive feedback on the various tests and whether the function passes or fails.
