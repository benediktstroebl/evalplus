```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list of elements.

    Returns:
        int or float: The maximum element in the list.
    """
    if not l:
        return None  # Return None if the list is empty
    max_el = l[0]
    for num in l:
        if num > max_el:
            max_el = num
    return max_el
``` 

The function 'max_element' takes a list 'l' as an argument and returns the maximum element in the list. To ensure correctness, the function initially verifies if the list is empty. If so, it returns None, indicating an empty list has no maximum element. If the list is not empty, the function compares each element to the currently predicted maximum element ('max_el'). It updates 'max_el' whenever a bigger element is found. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
max_element([1, 2, 3])  # Output: 3
max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])  # Output: 123
``` 

Based on the given input, the function will now output the maximum element. 

This correctly solves the problem statement and addresses the test cases mentioned in the specification.  If you have any questions or need additional assistance, please let me know!
