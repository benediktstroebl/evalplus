```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list of elements.

    Returns:
        int or float: The maximum element in the list.
    """
    if not l:
        raise ValueError("The input list is empty. Cannot determine the maximum element.")

    max_element = max(l)
    return max_element
```

The function `max_element` takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. It handles the edge case where the input list is empty by raising a `ValueError` with an appropriate error message.

The reasoning behind the code is pretty straightforward. The `max` function will compare each element in the list and return the maximum one, considering both integer and float numbers.

This solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(n log n), where 'n' is the length of the input list, as it involves iterating through the list once to find the maximum element.

The unit test for this code can be done by simply calling the function with different lists and confirming that it returns the expected maximum elements. 
 like this:
```python
>> max_element([1, 2, 3])
3
>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
123
>> max_element([])
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
ValueError: The input list is empty. Cannot determine the maximum element.
``` 
This confirms that the function works correctly and handles the empty list case as intended.
