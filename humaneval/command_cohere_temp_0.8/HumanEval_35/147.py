```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
```

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list using the `max` function. 

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```python
result = max_element([1, 2, 3])
print(result)  # Output: 3
```
 Changing the parameter to a list of any given numbers will yield the highest value in that list, making this a versatile and practical function for finding the maximum element among a collection of values.  This functionality can be quite useful in many situations where you need to find the highest value within a set of numbers.  In the first example, the function returns 3, which is the highest value in the list ([1, 2, 3]). 

This function is straightforward and effective, providing a simple way to find the maximum element in a list without needing to iterate through the list manually.
