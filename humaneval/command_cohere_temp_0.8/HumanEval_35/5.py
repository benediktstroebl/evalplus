```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    """
    return max(l)
```

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The function uses the `max` function to compare and return the highest value in the list. 

The `max_element` function is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum element in a given list, and its usage example shows how it can handle different input lists, returning the maximum element present in each list. 

If you were to call this function with the provided test cases, the output would be:
```
3
123
```

These values correspond to the maximum elements in each list, respectively.
