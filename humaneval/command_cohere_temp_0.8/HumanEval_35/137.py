```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])
    3
    >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    123
    """
    if not l:
        return None  # Return None if the list is empty
    max_el = l[0]
    for ele in l:
        if ele > max_el:
            max_el = ele
    return max_el
```
This Python script defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input. The function iterates through the list, tracking the maximum element seen so far using the variable `max_el`. However, if the input list is empty, it returns `None` as an empty list has no maximum element.  The function then returns the maximum element found. 

The function is tested twice in the docstring using the `>>>` marker to indicate test cases. Firstly, it is tested with a list of positive integers and secondly with a list of various integers, including negative values, whereby it successfully returns the maximum element in the list. 
```python
max_element([1, 2, 3])
# 3

max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
# 123
``` 
The function would be reusable in other Python scripts and could be optimized further if required. 
For example, if the list is already sorted in ascending order, the max element would be the last element in the list, and you could optimize the function to stop iterating once it reaches the end of the list. 
```python
def max_element(l: list):
    if not l:
        return None
    if l == l[0:]:  # Check if the list is sorted in ascending order
        return max(l)
    max_el = l[0]
    for ele in l[1:]:
        if ele > max_el:
            max_el = ele
    return max_el
``` 
In this optimized version, the function checks if the list is sorted using the condition `l == l[0:]` and if it is, it directly returns the last element in the list using `max(l)` as it is the maximum element.  If the list is not sorted, it still iterates through the list as before, but the optimization reduces the iterations needed for sorted lists.  This makes the function more efficient for sorted lists and maintains its generality for unsorted lists. 
However, note that the added efficiency comes at the cost of making the function slightly more complex and less immediately understandable, which may be a downside in some contexts. For more complex lists, this function may not be the most efficient and could be improved further by using more complex algorithms for larger inputs.  However, this would come at the cost of making the function more complex and harder to understand, which may not be suitable for simpler use cases.  As always, it depends on the specific needs and constraints of your situation.
