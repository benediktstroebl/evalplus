```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list using the `max` function. The function is designed to work independently and provides a clear and concise solution to the problem.  This approach uses the built-in `max` function in Python to directly return the maximum value present in the input list, without the need for additional logic or customization.
