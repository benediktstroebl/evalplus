```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])
    3
    >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    123
    """
    return max(l)
```
This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The function uses the `max` function to compare and return the highest value in the list.

The code includes type hints, which specify that the input parameter `l` is a list (`list`) and that the return value is an integer (`int`). These type hints provide documentation for other developers and can be used by code editors or linters to enforce type checking.

The function is tested with two example use cases, and the expected output is demonstrated. The first test case is a list of positive integers, and the max element is the highest number in the list. The second test case is a list of various integers, including negative values, and the max element is the largest value in the list regardless of sign. 

Overall, this code provides an efficient and straightforward solution to finding the maximum element in a list, achieving the objective as stated in the problem statement.  It is well-documented and formatted, making it readable and maintainable.
