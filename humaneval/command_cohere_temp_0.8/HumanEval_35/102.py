```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Returns the maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list using the `max` function. The `-> int` specifies that the return type of the function is integer. 

The specification of the return type is useful, especially when working with large codebases, as it enhances code readability and maintainability. Additionally, since the return type is explicitly stated as integer, any future changes or refactoring of the function that would require a different data type for the return value would require explicit attention and validation. 

The help text in the docstring is also valuable as it clearly explains what the function does, making it easier for other developers to understand its purpose and use. Furthermore, the presence of exemplary test cases assists in demonstrating how the function is used and conveys the expected behavior to stakeholders. 

To ensure its functionality, here are some tests you can run to validate the code:
```python
test_max_element = """
# Testing max_element function
import pytest

def test_max_element():
    # Basic test
    assert max_element([1, 2, 3]) == 3

    # Test with negative numbers
    assert max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]) == 123

def test_max_element_empty_list():
    # Test with an empty list
    assert max_element([]) == None

def test_max_element_None():
    # Test with a list containing None
    assert max_element([None, 2, 3, None]) == None
```

The first test examines the function's behavior with a standard list of elements, ensuring it correctly identifies the maximum element. The next test assesses the function's handling of negative numbers in a list and verifies that it returns the highest negative value. 

The third test involves an empty list and verifies that the function returns None. Finally, the last test checks how the function performs with a list that contains None and confirms that it returns None as the maximum element. 

 pytest is employed to execute each test individually, enabling a targeted and efficient testing approach.  This test suite covers various scenarios, aiding in confirming the robustness and correctness of the `max_element` function.
