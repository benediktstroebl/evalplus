```python
def max_element(l: list):
    max_element = max(l)
    return max_element
```

The function 'max_element' takes a list 'l' as an input, and uses the built-in function 'max' to find the maximum value within the list and returns it. This solution is straightforward and effective in determining the maximum element in a list.
