```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
```

This code defines a Python function called `max_element` that takes a list (`l`) as input and returns the maximum element in the list. It utilizes the built-in `max` function to compare and return the highest valued element present in the input list. 

The function is designed to efficiently find and return the maximum element in any given list, making it useful for various data analysis and retrieval tasks where finding the highest value item is necessary. 

This straightforward solution is optimized for speed and provides a concise way to solve the problem without requiring additional logic or dependencies.
