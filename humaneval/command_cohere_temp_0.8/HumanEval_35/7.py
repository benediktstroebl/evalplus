```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    
    Args:
        l (list): List of elements.
    
    Returns:
        int: Maximum element in the list.
    """
    if not l:
        raise ValueError("List cannot be empty")
    
    max_element = max(l)
    return max_element
```

The function takes a list `l` as an argument and returns the maximum element in the list. The `max` function returns the maximum value among all elements in the list. If the list is empty, it raises a `ValueError` indicating that the input list was empty.  This is useful because if we try to call `max()` on an empty list, Python will throw an error. 

This code is relatively efficient since the `max` function uses a built-in operation, and its complexity is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the list.
