```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Returns the maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list using the `max` function. The `max` function takes the list as an argument and returns its maximum element. This approach efficiently finds the maximum element in the list without the need for additional logic or customization.
