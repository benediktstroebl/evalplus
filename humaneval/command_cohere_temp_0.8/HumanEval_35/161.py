```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    
    Args:
        l (list): List of elements.
        
    Returns:
        int: Maximum element in the list.
    """
    return max(l)
```

This Python script provides a function named `max_element` that takes a list parameter `l` and returns the maximum element in the list. The function utilizes the built-in `max` function to compare and return the highest value in the list. 

The script does not utilize any external variables, and the function is self-contained, meaning it is complete in itself and doesn't depend on any other function or variable within the same script. 

If offered a list as an argument, this function will return the highest value within that list. 

You can use this function in your code to find the maximum element in any given list.
