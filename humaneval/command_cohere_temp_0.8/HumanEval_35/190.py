```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list of elements.

    Returns:
        int or float: The maximum element in the list.
    """
    if not l:
        raise ValueError("The input list is empty. Cannot determine the maximum element.")

    max_element = max(l)
    return max_element
```

This script defines a function max_element which takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The `max` function returns the maximum value present in the list. If the list is empty, it raises a `ValueError` indicating that the maximum element cannot be determined from an empty list. 

This code is structured simply and efficiently solves the problem while remaining readable and lucid. It is robust enough to handle a variety of scenarios, including both numeric and non-numeric lists, and is adaptable to potential future changes or expansions in functionality.
