```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Returns the maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list using the `max` function. 

The function is self-contained and can be run independently, as evidenced by its ability to produce the output `3` when provided with the argument `[1, 2, 3] `and the output `123` when provided with the argument `[5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]`. 

If the focus is on returning the maximum value in the list, this approach is straightforward and effective.
