```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    
    Args:
        l (list): The input list of elements.

    Returns:
        int or float: The maximum element in the list.
    """
    # initialize max element
    max_el = float('-inf')
    
    # iterate through the list and update max_el
    for x in l:
        if x > max_el:
            max_el = x
    
    return max_el
```

The function 'max_element' takes a list 'l' as an argument and returns the maximum element in the list. The function initially assigns the value '-infinity' to 'max_element' to handle any possible value in the list. It then iterates over each element 'x' in the list, comparing it to the current maximum element 'max_el'. If 'x' is greater than 'max_el', it updates 'max_el' with the new maximum value. This process ensures that the maximum value is correctly identified and returned, regardless of the specific content of the input list.  It ideally handles various input scenarios, including both positive and negative integers as well as floating-point numbers, accurately determining the maximum value within the list. 
The tests are not provided, but the function is straightforward and should pass any test case that validates maximum element behavior. A sample test case for this function is as follows:
```python
# Test the max_element function
def test_max_element():
    # Case 1: Positive integers
    assert max_element([1, 2, 3]) == 3

    # Case 2: Negative integers
    assert max_element([-5, -3, -1, -10]) == -1

    # Case 3: Floating-point numbers
    assert max_element([1.5, -2.3, 4.8, -1.2, 6.0]) == 6.0

    # Case 4: Mixed values
    assert max_element([1, -3, 2.5, 4, -1.2, 6.0]) == 6.0
```

This test suite contains multiple test cases that cover different scenarios, including positive and negative integers as well as floating-point numbers, and verifies that the function returns the expected maximum elements.
