```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The `max` built-in function is used to determine the maximum value in the list, which is the desired output for the given problem. 

This code is self-contained and can be run independently, as it does not rely on any external modules or dependencies. It also meets the given unit tests, as it returns the expected output for the test cases provided in the original problem statement.
