```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.

    >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])
    3
    >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    123
    """

    if not l:
        return None  # Return None if the list is empty

    max_el = l[0]  # Initialize the maximum element with the first element of the list

    for el in l:
        if el > max_el:  # Compare each list element to the current maximum
            max_el = el  # Update the maximum element if a larger element is found

    return max_el
```

This code defines a function max_element that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The function initially checks if the list is empty, returning None if so. It then initializes the maximum element as the first element of the list. Subsequently, it iterates through the list, comparing each element to the current maximum and updating the maximum element if a larger element is encountered. Ultimately, it returns the maximum element found. 

The function's concise logic enables efficient maximum element identification within a list, making it a valuable tool for list manipulation and analysis in various Python applications. 

The unit tests are absent in this code, but it does provide a functional self-contained Python script.

If you intend to evaluate this function on various input lists, incorporating unit tests is advisable to ensure its robustness and accuracy. Unit testing frameworks like 'unittest' or 'pytest' can assist in structuring the tests, enabling comprehensive evaluation of the function's behavior across diverse input scenarios.
