```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])
    3
    >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    123
    """
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. Inside the function, the `max` built-in function is used to determine the maximum value in the list.

The function is tested twice in the docstring using the `>>>` prompt, which is used to indicate test cases in Python. The first test case is a list of integers [1, 2, 3], and the expected output is 3. The second test case is a list of integers [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10], and the expected output is 123. 

The function is designed to be self-contained, meaning it does not rely on any external variables or functions other than those explicitly defined or imported in the module it is located in. It can be called from anywhere in the module or from another module if it is properly imported.  It is a fundamental practice in Python to describe the functionality of a function using docstrings, which are text blocks that precede the function's definition to provide information about what the function does, what parameters it takes, and what it returns. Docstrings are useful for providing information to users who may want to know how to use the function and are also used by the Python interpreter's automatic documentation generation tool. 

This way, the function is reusable and can be safely called from different places in the code or even from outside the module, depending on how it's exported or imported.  If you want to test the function with different input, you can uncomment the last two lines of the script and see the output.

```python
# List of integers
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print("Maximum element of the list:", max_element(my_list)) 

# List of integers
my_list = [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]
print("Maximum element of the list:", max_element(my_list)) 
``` 

This would output:
```
Maximum element of the list: 3
Maximum element of the list: 123
```

You can uncomment these lines and execute the code to see the result.
