```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    
    Args:
        l (list): List of elements.
        
    Returns:
        int: Maximum element in the list.
    """
    return max(l)
```

This Python script defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list (`l`) as an argument and returns the maximum element in the list. The `max` built-in function is used to compare and return the highest value in the list.

The docstring includes an Args section to describe the input parameter, and a Returns section to describe the return value, providing clear documentation for users of the function.

If the provided input is a list of elements, this function will return the maximum element within that list.
