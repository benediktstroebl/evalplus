```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    
    Args:
        l (list): List of elements.
    
    Returns:
        int: Maximum element in the list.
    """
    if not l:
        raise ValueError("The input list is empty")
    
    max_element = max(l)
    return max_element
```

The function `max_element` uses the built-in `max` function to find the maximum element in the list. It raises a `ValueError` if the input list is empty, and returns the maximum element otherwise. 

This solution adheres to the problem statement and matches the expected functionality, including the test cases provided. Let me know if you'd like to refine the solution or provide any additional feedback!
