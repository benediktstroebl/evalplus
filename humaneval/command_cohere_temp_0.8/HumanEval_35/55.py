```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.

    :param l: A list of integers.
    :type l: list
    :return: The maximum element in the list.
    :rtype: int
    """
    if not l:
        raise ValueError("Cannot compute the maximum element of an empty list")
    
    # Initialize the maximum element variable
    max_el = l[0]
    
    # Traverse the list and update the maximum element, if a bigger element is found
    for num in l:
        if num > max_el:
            max_el = num
    
    return max_el
```

The algorithm uses a simple iterative approach, and at each iteration, the maximum element `max_el` gets updated if the current list element is greater than it. This approach has a time complexity of O(n) since it requires traversing the entire list once.

This code snippet provides a precise and tested implementation of the maximum element determination, as requested. Let me know if you need any further clarification or additional details.
