```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.

    :param l: A list of integers.
    :return: The maximum element in the list.
    """
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a Python function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list using the `max` function. This is a built-in Python function that returns the largest value present in a list of numbers. It's a straightforward and efficient way to find the maximum element in a list.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```python
print(max_element([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 3
print(max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]))  # Output: 123
```

The function conveniently returns the maximum element in the list, making it useful for quickly finding the highest value within a list of numbers.
