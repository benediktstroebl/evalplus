```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    
    Args:
        l (list): List of elements.
        
    Returns:
        int: Maximum element in the list.
    """
    return max(l)
```

The max() function is used to determine the maximum value in the provided list l. This solution is concise and efficient, returning the maximum element in the list in a single line of code.
