```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])
    3
    >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    123
    """
    return max(l)
```
This Python script defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input. Inside the function, it uses the `max()` function to determine the maximum value in the given list and returns it. The function includes a docstring that includes two example tests in the form of Python's "assert" statement, which tests if a given condition is true, and passes if the condition is satisfied, or fails and raises an assertion error if the condition is not satisfied. 
The two example tests assert that the function max_element successfully outputs the maximum element in the given lists [1, 2, 3] and [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]. 
Lastly, the function returns the maximum element detected in the input list. 
This fulfills the request and the code passes the tests specified in the docstring.  feedback is welcome! Let me know if you would like any alterations to the code.
