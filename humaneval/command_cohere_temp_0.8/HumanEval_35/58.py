```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])
    3
    >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    123
    """
    return max(l)
```
The function `max_element` takes a list `l` as an argument and returns the maximum element in the list using the `max` function. The given examples demonstrate the function's behavior for two different lists: one containing positive integers only and the other containing both positive and negative integers. 

The code snippet is self-contained, meaning it can be copied and run as is without relying on external modules or dependencies. 
The function passes the test examples provided, confirming its correctness. Picking the code snippet will reproduce the function and its behavior in your Python environment. You can incorporate it into your project and utilize it to determine the maximum element in any list you provide. 
If needed, you can add additional tests to ensure that the function behaves as expected with a variety of input lists.
