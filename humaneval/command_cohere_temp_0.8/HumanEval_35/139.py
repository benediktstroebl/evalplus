```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.

    :param l: A list of numbers.
    :return: The maximum element in the list.
    """
    return max(l)
``` 

This code provides an optimized way to find the maximum element in a list using the `max()` function as opposed to a conditional statement like `max_element` is supposed to do in the prompt. It also serves as a documentation snippet for the function it defines, accurately describing its purpose, parameters, and return value, making it a reliable tool for anyone who needs to find the maximum element in a list of numbers.
