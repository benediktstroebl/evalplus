```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The `max` built-in function is used to find the maximum value in the list. 

The docstring at the top of the function provides documentation that explains the purpose of the function, the argument, and the return value.

The "```python" and "```" markup delimiters at the beginning and end of the block designate it as a Python code block within the Markdown text. This is commonly used to embed playable code snippets in Markdown documents.
