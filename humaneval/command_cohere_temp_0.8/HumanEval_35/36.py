```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The `max` built-in function is used to find the maximum value in the list. 

The function is designed to work with any valid list input, regardless of the data types of the list elements. It efficiently computes the maximum value in the list without explicit looping and returns it as an output. 

This solution is optimally efficient in terms of both time and space complexity, utilizing the built-in `max` function's functionality to achieve a linear time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list.
