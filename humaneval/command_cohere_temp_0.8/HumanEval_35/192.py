```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.

    :param l: A list of numbers.
    :return: The maximum element in the list.
    """
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list called `l` as input. Inside the function, it uses the `max()` function to return the maximum value in the input list. 

The documentation string denotes a detailed problem description, the input parameter, and the output of the function for the developer's reference. 

This solution is self-contained, meaning it does not rely on any external variables or functions, making it easily transferable and reusable as is. 

You can test this function by calling it with a list of values to compare the output with the expected result. 
For example: `max_element([1, 2, 3])` should return `3`, and `max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])` should return `123`.
