```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    
    Args:
        l (list): The input list.
    
    Returns:
        int or float: The maximum element in the list.
    """
    return max(l)
``` 

This code provides an optimized way to find the maximum element in a list using the `max` function as an inbuilt Python solution tailored for lists, returning the maximum element present in the list. It is efficient and convenient for this use case without requiring any additional loops or manual comparisons.  This solution is concise and follows Python's famous principle of "Batteries Included," leveraging the built-in max function to accomplish the task.
