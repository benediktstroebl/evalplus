```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    
    Args:
        l (list): List of elements.
        
    Returns:
        int: Maximum element in the list.
    """
    return max(l)
```

This code provides an optimized way to find the maximum element in a list using the `max` function as an inbuilt Python solution compared to a brute-force approach, which is less efficient. It takes in a list of elements and returns the maximum element present in the list.  The function maximizes code reusability and minimizes the codebase by using an internal Python function. 

The `max` function returns the maximum value in a list, which is mathematically correct. It is a built-in Python function that takes iterable l as input and returns its maximum element. The function is designed to be efficient and optimized, which makes it a suitable choice for finding the maximum element in a list. 

The documentation for the function shows its utility and provides examples for users to comprehend and utilize the function effectively.

The function can be used in the following ways:
```
1. max_element([1, 2, 3]) # 3
2. max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]) # 123
```
The given examples demonstrate the use of the `max_element` function to return the maximum element in the list, providing maximum efficiency in solving the problem.
