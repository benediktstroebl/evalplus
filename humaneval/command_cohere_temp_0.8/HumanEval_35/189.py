```python
def max_element(l: list):
    max_element = max(l)
    return max_element
```

The function 'max_element' takes a list `l` as an input, and uses the built-in function `max` to find the maximum value in the list. The returned maximum value is then assigned to the variable `max_element` before returning. 

This approach takes advantage of Python's list comprehension and maximal selection algorithms, making it an efficient solution.
