```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
```

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list using the `max` function. The function is designed to work with any valid list input, and the outcome is an integer representing the highest value in the list. 

The docstring at the beginning of the code provides a description of the function's purpose, and it is appended with a reminder about the expected type of return value (integer). This particular design of the docstring enables programmers to verify the function's return value when using an interactive interpreter owing to the `` notation.

You can use this function by adding the list you want to search as an argument, such as `max_element([1, 2, 3])`, which should return `3` as the maximum element in the list. 

If you want to verify the function's behavior on more complicated lists with both positive and negative values, try using the second example provided in the prompt, such as `max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])` should return `123`. 

This approach provides a straightforward solution to identify the list's maximum element, rendering it a useful tool for many list-related activities.  If you want to adapt this function to suit your particular requirements, you can do so by modifying the arguments and documentation to fit your needs.
