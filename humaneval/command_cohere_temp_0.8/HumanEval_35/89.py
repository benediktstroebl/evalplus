```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.

    >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])
    3
    >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    123
    """
    if not l:
        return None
    max_el = max(l)
    return max_el
```
The function `max_element` returns the maximum element in the given list. The function first checks if the list is empty, and if so, it returns `None`. If the list is not empty, it finds the maximum element using the `max` function and returns it. This approach ensures that the function always returns a valid result.  The unit tests provided in the problem statement are satisfactory. They validate the function's behavior against two different cases. However, it might be beneficial to augment the test suite with additional scenarios, such as lists containing negative elements, zeroes, or duplicates, to further reinforce the function's robustness. 
The docstring, which is a multi-line comment enclosed in triple quotes, provides a description of the function and its behavior. By adopting this practice, the code becomes more readable and understandable. 

Please note that the code I have provided will return `None` if the list is empty and `max_element` is called, as it is good practice in Python to handle edge cases and make your code robust. Let me know if you need any more help with anything!
