```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    
    Args:
        l (list): List of elements.
        
    Returns:
        int: Maximum element in the list.
    """
    return max(l)
```

This code provides a clear explanation of the problem and its solution. The function `max_element` takes a list `l` as an argument and returns the maximum element in the list using the `max` function. The `max` function takes the list as an argument and returns the maximum value in the list.

The comments introduce the function, describe its parameters and return value, and explain its purpose. These comments help understand the code and are especially useful for those who may not be familiar with the function's functionality. 

The docstring conforms to the Python standard for docstrings, providing a clear and concise description of the function's purpose, arguments, and return value. This format makes the code more readable and understandable. 

To verify the correctness of the function, I would suggest creating tests that cover different cases. These tests can check both valid and invalid inputs to make sure the function behaves as expected. Here's an example of test cases to ensure the max_element function behaves correctly:
```python
def test_max_element():
    # Single element list
    assert max_element([5]) == 5

    # Standard list
    assert max_element([1, 2, 3, 10, 9, 8]) == 10

    # List with negative elements
    assert max_element([-1, -10, -5, 0, 5, 10]) == 10

    # Empty list
    assert max_element([]) == None

    # List with a single element None
    assert max_element([None]) == None

    # List with multiple None elements
    assert max_element([None, None, 5, None, 10, None]) == 10
```

This test suite covers multiple scenarios to ensure the max_element function behaves correctly. By running these test cases, you can verify that the function returns the expected outputs for each scenario.  This helps to validate the correctness of the code and ensure that the function handles different input types correctly.
