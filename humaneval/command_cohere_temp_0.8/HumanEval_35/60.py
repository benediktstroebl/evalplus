```python
def max_element(l: list):
    max_element = max(l)
    return max_element
```

The function `max_element` uses the built-in `max` function to find the maximum value in the input list. It then returns this maximum value. The `max` function returns the maximum value present in the list. If there are multiple occurrences of the maximum value, it returns just one of them. 

This solution is efficient and does not require any additional imports. It is also concise and easy to read, which is important for maintaining and evolving the code over time. 

You can test this function by calling it with a list of values and comparing the result to the expected maximum value.
