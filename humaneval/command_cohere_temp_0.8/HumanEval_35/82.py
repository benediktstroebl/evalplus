```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])
    3
    >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    123
    """
    return max(l)
```
The function `max_element` takes a list `l` as an argument and returns the maximum element in the list. This function uses the built-in `max` function in Python to find the maximum element in the list. 

This solution passes the given tests:
```python
>>> max_element([1, 2, 3])
3
>>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
123
```
It's common to include robustness tests in your codebase to ensure that the function can handle various edge cases gracefully:
```python
def test_max_element():
    # Test with empty list
    assert max_element([]) == None

    # Test with one element
    assert max_element([5]) == 5

    # Test with negative and positive elements
    assert max_element([-1, 2, -3, 4, -5, 6]) == 6

    # Test with float elements
    l = [1.5, 2, 3, -1.0, -2.5]
    assert max_element(l) == 1.5

    # Test with complex elements (just for fun)
    l.append(2 + 3j)
    assert max_element(l) == 1.5 + 3j  # Complex numbers are compared by their absolute value
``` 
You can use `None` as the return value when dealing with an empty list: since there are no elements in the list, there is no maximum element. 

Adding tests for different scenarios can help check the function's correctness in various cases and ensure that the function handles all these cases without throwing any errors.  If you encounter any issues or have further questions, please don't hesitate to ask! Enjoy coding and testing!
