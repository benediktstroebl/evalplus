```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Returns the maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The `max` built-in function is used to determine the maximum value in the list, which is the element that appears highest in the list sorted in ascending order. This function would produce the same output as the given example in the problem statement.
