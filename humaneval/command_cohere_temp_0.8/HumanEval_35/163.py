```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    
    Args:
        l (list): The input list.
    
    Returns:
        int or float: The maximum element in the list.
    """
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list using the `max` function. This is the concise version of the function to achieve the same goal as mentioned in the problem statement.
