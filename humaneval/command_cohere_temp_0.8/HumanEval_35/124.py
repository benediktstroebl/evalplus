```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
```

This code defines a Python function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. Inside the function, it uses the `max()` function to determine the highest value in the input list and returns that maximum value. 

The docstring provides information about the function's purpose, input, and output, and it includes example usage that shows how the function can be invoked with different lists to find the maximum element within them. 

If the specified input is a non-empty list, this code will correctly identify the maximum element in the list.

**Test Cases:**
```python
def test_max_element():
    # Maximum element in a list of positive integers.
    assert max_element([1, 2, 3]) == 3

    # Maximum element in a list with negative and positive integers.
    assert max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]) == 123
```

The test suite consists of a single function test_max_element that evaluates the correctness of the max_element function with the given examples. The first assertion tests the function with a list of positive integers, ensuring it returns the largest element, which is 3. The second assertion evaluates the function on a list of mixed positive and negative integers, confirming it returns the greatest element, which is 123. 

These test cases properly verify the functionality of the provided code, ensuring it behaves as expected in different scenarios.
