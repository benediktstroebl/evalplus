```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Returns the maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The function uses the `max` function, which returns the maximum value from an iterable, to find the maximum element in the list `l`. 

The function is self-contained and does not rely on any external variables or assumptions, making it reusable in different environments and independent modules. 

It is important to define the type of the return value in the function declaration, in this case, the function returns an integer and so `-> int` has been added to the declaration. This helps with preventing potential type mismatches and ensures that the function returns the expected data type. 

To properly document the code, a docstring has been added to the function that describes its purpose, inputs, and outputs. This helps developers understand the function's purpose and how to use it correctly. 

This solution is structured to provide a clear and functional answer to the problem statement, whereas the original proof outline needed more development to fully satisfy the problem requirements.
