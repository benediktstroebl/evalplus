```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function `max_element(l: list)` that finds the maximum element in a given list `l` using the `max()` function. 

The "Maximum Element in a List" problem is a common challenge in programming tasks involving basic list operations. It requires finding the highest value among all elements in the list. This solution employs a straightforward approach, leveraging Python's built-in `max()` function to compare and return the maximum element in the list. The specification of the function is also included, clarifying its purpose and providing example tests. 

This is an efficient and optimal solution to the problem that does not require any additional logic or complexity.
