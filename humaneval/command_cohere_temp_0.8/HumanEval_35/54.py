```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
```

This Python script defines a function `max_element(l: list)` that finds the maximum element in the provided list using the `max()` function, which returns the maximum value present in the list. The function returns this maximum element. 

The function works correctly and is self-contained, meaning it doesn't rely on any external variables or assumptions. You can use it as a standalone function to find the maximum element in any list you pass to it.
