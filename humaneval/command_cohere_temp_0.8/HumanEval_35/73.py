```python
def max_element(l: list):
    max_element = max(l)
    return max_element
```

The function `max_element` uses the built-in `max` function to find the maximum value in the input list `l`. The returned value is the maximum element present in the list. 

This solution is concise and efficient, directly solving the problem without any additional complexity. It provides a straightforward way to find the maximum element in a list, making it accessible for both beginner and advanced Python programmers. 

You can test this function by calling it with different lists and verifying that it returns the expected maximum elements for each case.
