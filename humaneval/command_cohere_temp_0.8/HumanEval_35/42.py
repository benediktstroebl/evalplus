```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    
    Args:
        l (list): List of elements.
        
    Returns:
        int: Maximum element in the list.
    """
    return max(l)
```

This Python script defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list (`l`) as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The `max` function is used to compare and return the highest value in the input list. The function is designed to be self-contained, meaning it doesn't rely on any external variables or assumptions, and it efficiently computes the maximum element using a built-in Python function.
