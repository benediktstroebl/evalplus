```python
def max_element(l: list):
    max_element = max(l)
    return max_element
```

The max() function takes the list as an argument and returns the maximum value present in it. This max_element value is then returned, ensuring the shortest code possible to solve the problem while still being correct.

The tests would be done thus:
```python
test_max_element = [
    ([1, 2, 3], 3),
    ([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10], 123),
]

for test, expected in test_max_element:
    assert max_element(test) == expected
```

This provides test cases and expected output, testing the function in a variety of ways.
