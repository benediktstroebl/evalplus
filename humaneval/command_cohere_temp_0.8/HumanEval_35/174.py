```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    
    Args:
        l (list): List of elements.
        
    Returns:
        int: Maximum element in the list.
    """
    return max(l)
```

This script defines a function called `max_element(l)` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The function uses the built-in `max()` function to compare all elements in the list and returns the highest value. This approach is simple and efficient, achieving the goal of finding the maximum element in the list in a straightforward manner.
