```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])
    3
    >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    123
    """
    return max(l)
```
This Python script defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input. Inside the function, it utilizes the `max()` function to determine the maximum value present in the input list. This ensures that the function correctly returns the highest element in the list, regardless of whether the list contains positive or negative numbers. The function is also equipped with docstrings, which provide information about what the function does and provide example usage scenarios. These example scenarios showcase how the function behaves when provided with different lists, emphasizing its adaptability to diverse input conditions. Finally, the `max_element` function returns the maximum element found in the input list, making it an invaluable tool for identifying the highest value within any given list of numbers.
