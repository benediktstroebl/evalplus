```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Returns the maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The function uses the `max` function, which returns the maximum value from an iterable, to determine the maximum element in the list. 

This solution is straightforward and efficient, returning the maximum element in the list in a single line of code. 
The function is also robust, as it can handle any list input and will always return the largest element in the list, regardless of the list's content or size. 

To verify the functionality of the code, you can call the function with multiple test cases to ensure that it returns the expected maximum element in each case. For example: 

```python
max_element([1, 2, 3]) # Expected output: 3
max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]) # Expected output: 123
``` 

Which would return: 

```
3
123
``` 

Revising the code to include the `return` statement after the `max` function would be more concise and aligned with Python conventions, contributing to code readability and maintaining a good reputation for code maintenance and alteration, especially in larger codebases. 

Please note that this function only works for lists that contain at least one element. If the list is empty, the function will return `None` because there are no elements to compare.
