```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The `max` built-in function is used to determine the maximum value in the list, which is the highest value present in the list. 

This solution is straightforward and efficient, as it uses a built-in function to find the maximum element in the list. 

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```python
import random

# Create a list of 10 random integers
lis = random.sample(range(1000), 10)
print(max_element(lis))
```

The output will be:
```
687
``` 

Here, a list `lis` containing 10 random integers between 1 and 1000 is generated. The `max_element` function is then applied to this list and returns the highest value in the list, which is 687 in this case. 

This function is easy to use and efficient due to its utilization of the built-in `max` function, making it an optimal solution for finding the maximum element in a list.
