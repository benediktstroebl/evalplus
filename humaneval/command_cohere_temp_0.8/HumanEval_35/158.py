```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    
    Args:
        l (list): List of elements.
    
    Returns:
        int or float: Maximum element in the list.
    """
    if not l:
        raise ValueError("List cannot be empty")
    
    max_element = max(l)
    return max_element
```

This script defines a function 'max_element' that takes a list 'l' as an argument and returns the maximum element in the list. The max() function takes a list of numbers and returns the maximum number in that list.

The function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it raises a ValueError with the message "List cannot be empty". This is done to prevent the function from crashing or returning a wrong result if the input list is empty, and instead provide a clear error message to indicate what the problem is. 

The function then uses the built-in max() function to find the maximum element in the list. The max() function takes a list of numbers and returns the maximum number in that list. 

The function finally returns the maximum element. 

This solution is straightforward, effective, and easy to understand. It leverages Python's built-in functions to handle the error case and the core computation, making it concise and following the principle of using appropriate abstractions.
