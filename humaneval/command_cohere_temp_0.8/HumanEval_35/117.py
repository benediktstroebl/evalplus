```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.

    :param l: A list of integers.
    :return: The maximum element in the list.
    """
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list called `l` as an input. Inside the function, it uses the `max()` function to return the maximum value in the input list. The comment in the code explains these actions to find the maximum element in the list.

This solution should solve the problem and pass the tests you have, as it correctly identifies the maximum element in the given list using the `max()` function. 
Please confirm if this solution is appropriate for your requirements. Feel free to ask if you have any more questions or if you would like more information on this topic. Possibilities of various solutions are discussed below for alternative considerations. 

**NOTE:** If you were writing your own tests and needed assurance that the function handles various edge cases and different types of input lists, you might consider writing more comprehensive tests. 
However, the provided solution already handles the core functionality of finding the max element and is relatively concise. 

Here are some additional points to consider: 

1. **Data Handling:** The function assumes the list contains integers and does not handle any other data types like floats or strings. If the function needs to handle different data types, considerations would be made to avoid potential errors and ensure compatibility. 

2. **Negative Numbers:** The function ignores the sign of the numbers and returns the maximum value, regardless of the sign. If the function is required to identify the maximum value with specific sign considerations, additional modifications would be needed. 

3. **Complexity:** The current function is straightforward and achieves the core task efficiently. If there are specific requirements for additional functionality, the code could be extended to handle other scenarios. 

4. **Error Handling:** The function assumes the input is a valid list, and error handling is neglected in the solution. Addressing potential errors like `ValueError` or `TypeError` could be added to the function to make it more robust. 

Let me know how these points for further development and additional considerations that may be relevant to your needs.
