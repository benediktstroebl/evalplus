```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Returns the maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list using the `max` function. The `max` function takes the list and returns the maximum value in the list, which is an integer. This approach elegantly solves the problem while maintaining code simplicity and efficiency.
