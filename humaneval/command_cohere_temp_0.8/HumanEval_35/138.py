```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The `max` built-in function is used to determine the maximum value in the list. 

This solution is concise and efficient, as it leverages the built-in `max` function to find the maximum element in the list. The function provides the same behavior as the specified behavior in the prompt. 

The documentation is also included, which confirms that the function returns the maximum element in the list.
