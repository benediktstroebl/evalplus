```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        int or float: The maximum element in the list.
    """

    # Initialize maximum value
    max_value = float('-inf')

    # Iterate through the list and update the maximum value
    for element in l:
        if element > max_value:
            max_value = element

    return max_value
```

The function `max_element` takes a list `l` as an argument and returns the maximum element in the list. To ensure that the maximum element is correctly detected even in cases where the list contains negative numbers, the initial maximum value is set to negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This is done to avoid false positives in comparing with negative numbers.

The function then iterates over each element in the input list, comparing it to the current maximum value. If an element is greater than the current maximum, it is updated to the new maximum value. This process ensures that the correct maximum element is found even in lists with negative or positive elements. 

The unit tests in the problem statement ensure that the function correctly identifies the maximum element in both normal and extreme cases. These tests would pass without error when applied to the function.
