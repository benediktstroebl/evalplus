```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    
    Args:
        l (list): List of elements.
        
    Returns:
        int: Maximum element in the list.
    """
    return max(l)
```

This script defines a function called `max_element(l)` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The function uses the `max()` function to compare all elements in the list and returns the highest value. This approach works for all positive integers, 0, and negative integers. 

To ensure that the function behaves correctly for all possible inputs, include tests for edge cases such as an empty list, a list containing NaN (Not a Number) values, and large positive and negative values in the test suite.
