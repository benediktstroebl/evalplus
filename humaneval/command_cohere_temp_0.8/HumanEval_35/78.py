```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
``` 

This code defines a function called `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list using the `max` function. 

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```python
print(max_element([1, 2, 3]))  # Outputs: 3
``` 

And here is the expected outcome for the test cases provided:
```bash
3
123
``` 
This demonstrates that the function can successfully determine the maximum element in the given lists.
