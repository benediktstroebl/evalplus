```python
def max_element(l: list):
    max_element = max(l)
    return max_element
```

The function `max_element` uses the built-in `max` function to find the maximum value in the given list `l`. It assumes that the list contains at least one element to avoid any potential errors with an empty list, and it returns the maximum element directly. 

The solution is concise and leverages Python's built-in functions to accomplish the task with a straightforward API that can handle any valid input list. 

This approach ensures readability and efficiency, making it an optimal solution for the problem.  If needed, it can be extended to handle edge cases, such as empty lists, by adding supplemental logic if there are specific requirements.
