Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def remove_vowels(text):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    return text.translate(str.maketrans("", "", vowels))
```

The function removes vowels (both uppercase and lowercase) from a given text using the `translate` method with a translation table created using `str.maketrans`. This approach ensures that all occurrences of vowels are removed while keeping non-vowel characters intact.

The expected outcome for each test case is:
```
>>> remove_vowels('')
''
>>> remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm")
'bcdf\nghjklm'
>>> remove_vowels('abcdef')
'bcdf'
>>> remove_vowels('aaaaa')
''
>>> remove_vowels('aaBAA')
'B'
>>> remove_vowels('zbcd')
'zbcd'
```
