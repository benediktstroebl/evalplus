Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def remove_vowels(text):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    return text.translate(str.maketrans("", "", vowels))
```

The function removes vowels (both lowercase and uppercase) from the input text using the `translate` method with a translation table created using `str.maketrans()`. This approach ensures that all occurrences of vowels are removed while keeping non-vowel characters intact. The expected behavior of the function is demonstrated through illustrative tests in the code block, showcasing its effectiveness in removing vowels from different input scenarios.

Here is an example of how to test the function:
```python
def test_remove_vowels():
    assert remove_vowels("") == ""
    assert remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm") == "bcdf\nghjklm"
    assert remove_vowels("abcdef") == "bcdf"
    assert remove_vowels("aaaaa") == ""
    assert remove_vowels("aaBAA") == "B"
    assert remove_vowels("zbcd") == "zbcd"
```
