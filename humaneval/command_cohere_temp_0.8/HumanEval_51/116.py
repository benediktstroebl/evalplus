Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def remove_vowels(text):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    return text.translate(str.maketrans("", "", vowels))
```

The function removes vowels (both uppercase and lowercase) from a given text using the `translate` method with a translation table created using `str.maketrans`. It supports various edge cases like empty strings, strings with newlines, and cases where removing vowels results in an empty string.

Here's the documentation for the function:
```
remove_vowels is a function that takes a string text as input and returns a string without any vowels.

Parameters:
    text (str): The input string from which vowels will be removed.

Returns:
    str: The modified string with all vowels removed.

Examples:
    >>> remove_vowels('')
    ''

    >>> remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm")
    'bcdf\nghjklm'

    >>> remove_vowels('abcdef')
    'bcdf'

    >>> remove_vowels('aaaaa')
    ''

    >>> remove_vowels('aaBAA')
    'B'

    >>> remove_vowels('zbcd')
    'zbcd'
```

This code adheres to Python's syntax and style guidelines and follows the expected formatting for functions, including docstrings, parameters, and return values. It should be easily understandable and usable by other Python developers.
