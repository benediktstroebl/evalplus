Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def remove_vowels(text):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    return text.translate(str.maketrans("", "", vowels))
```

The function removes vowels from the input text using the `translate` method and a translation table created with `str.maketrans`. This approach ensures that all possible vowels (both lowercase and uppercase) are removed from the text.

The tests are included within the function as assert statements, which verify that the function produces the expected output for various input scenarios. 

```python
def test_remove_vowels():
    assert remove_vowels("") == ""
    assert remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm") == "bcdf\nghjklm"
    assert remove_vowels("abcdef") == "bcdf"
    assert remove_vowels("aaaaa") == ""
    assert remove_vowels("aaBAA") == "B"
    assert remove_vowels("zbcd") == "zbcd"
```

You can execute this code to see the tests pass, confirming the correct operation of the `remove_vowels` function.

This solution is efficient, completely self-contained within the remove_vowels function, and provides comprehensive test coverage to ensure the correctness of the code.
