Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def remove_vowels(text):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    return text.translate(str.maketrans("", "", vowels))
```

This function removes vowels (both lowercase and uppercase) from the input text using the `translate` method and providing a translation table with empty characters. It handles various edge cases, including empty strings, strings with whitespace, and cases where the input text contains different combinations of vowels and consonants. The function returns the modified text without vowels. 
The code includes a `tests` module with test cases to cover different scenarios and ensure the correct behavior of the `remove_vowels` function. These tests would check cases like empty strings, single and multi-line strings, and various vowel combinations to ensure the function appropriately removes vowels without introducing any inconsistencies in the text's structure. 
Here's a sample of the tests module:
```python
def test_remove_vowels():
    assert remove_vowels("") == ""
    assert remove_vowels("abcdef") == "bcdf"
    assert remove_vowels("aaaaa") == ""
    assert remove_vowels("aaBAA") == "B"
    assert remove_vowels("zbcd") == "zbcd"
    text = "this is a test with vowels: ai, oi, and uei"
    assert remove_vowels(text) == "ths s a tst wth vwl ns: , o , nd ue"
``` 
This is just a subset of the complete tests module that would cover all scenarios, but it gives you an idea of how to structure the tests to validate the `remove_vowels` function. 
To run these test cases, you can use a testing framework like `pytest`. You can add a test script with the test cases and run it using `pytest` to execute the tests and report any failures or errors. 
For example, you can create a file named `test_remove_vowels.py` with the test cases and run it using the command `pytest test_remove_vowels.py`. 
This way, you can ensure that the `remove_vowels` function behaves as expected and correctly removes vowels from different types of input text.
