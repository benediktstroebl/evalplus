Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def remove_vowels(text):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    return text.translate(str.maketrans("", "", vowels))
```

The function removes vowels from the input text using the `translate` method and a translation table created with `str.maketrans()`. The result is returned as the modified text without vowels.
