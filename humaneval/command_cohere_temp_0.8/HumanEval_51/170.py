Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def remove_vowels(text):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    return text.translate(str.maketrans("", "", vowels))
```

The function removes vowels from the input text using the `translate` method and a translation table created with `str.maketrans`. This approach ensures that all types of vowels (lowercase and uppercase) are removed correctly. The tests provided for the function show its correctness against various edge cases. 
The tests cases are:
```python
>>> remove_vowels('')
''
>>> remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm")
'bcdf\nghjklm'
>>> remove_vowels('abcdef')
'bcdf'
>>> remove_vowels('aaaaa')
''
>>> remove_vowels('aaBAA')
'B'
>>> remove_vowels('zbcd')
'zbcd'
```

The output of the tests corresponds to the expected output in the markdown code block. 
This approach makes the code more concise and efficient by avoiding explicit list comprehension and providing a more readable syntax for the translation table. 

The PEP 8 specifies that variables should have meaningful names and be descriptive, whereas, in this case, the variable `vowels` represents the string of vowels, which is meaningful and clearly conveys its purpose. Thus enhances code readability and maintains compliance with coding conventions.  It also adheres to the Python style guidelines, making the code more robust and maintainable.
