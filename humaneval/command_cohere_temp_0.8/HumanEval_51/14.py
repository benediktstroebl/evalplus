Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def remove_vowels(text):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    return text.translate(str.maketrans("", "", vowels))
```

The function removes vowels from the input text using the `translate` method and a translation table created with `str.maketrans`. It supports various edge cases like empty strings, strings with whitespace, and cases where the removal of vowels results in an empty string.

Here's the additional test cases outlined in the prompt to further validate the function:
```python
def test_remove_vowels():
    cases = [
        ("", ""),
        ("abcdef\nghijklm", "bcdf\nghjklm"),
        ("abcdef", "bcdf"),
        ("aaaaa", ""),
        ("aaBAA", "B"),
        ("zbcd", "zbcd"),
    ]

    for text, expected in cases:
        assert remove_vowels(text) == expected

test_remove_vowels()
```

The test suite will execute the function with the provided test cases and compare the output with the expected results.

To run the test suite, ensure you have Python and either tap the Run button or execute the script in your Python environment.
