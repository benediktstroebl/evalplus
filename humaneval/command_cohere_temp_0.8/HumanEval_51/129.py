Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def remove_vowels(text):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    return text.translate(str.maketrans("", "", vowels))
```

The function removes vowels from the input text using the `translate` method and a translation table created with `str.maketrans()`. This approach ensures that the code works for both lowercase and uppercase vowels. It also handles different whitespace and line endings, as well as any other characters in the input text. The expected behavior in the edge cases matches the problem statement:
```markdown
```python
def remove_vowels(text):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    return text.translate(str.maketrans("", "", vowels))
```
```
Here are some examples of how the function works:
```
1. `remove_vowels('')` returns an empty string.
2. `remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm")` returns `'bcdf\nghjklm'`, meaning the vowels are removed but whitespace and line endings remain the same.
3. `remove_vowels('abcdef')` returns `'bcdf'`, similar to the first example, but with the input being a string without line endings.
4. `remove_vowels('aaaaa')` returns an empty string because the entire string consists of vowels.
5. Finally, for the input `'aaBAA'`, the function correctly returns `'B'`, as it removes the vowels but leaves other characters untouched.
```
This code provides an accurate and efficient way to remove vowels from any given text while handling various scenarios and maintaining proper string formatting. 
It can be used directly within a larger program or imported from a separate module, 
```python
from remove_vowels import remove_vowels
```
