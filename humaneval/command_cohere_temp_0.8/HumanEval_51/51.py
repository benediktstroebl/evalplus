Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def remove_vowels(text):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    return text.translate(str.maketrans("", "", vowels))
```

The function removes vowels (both lowercase and uppercase) from the input text using the `translate` method with a translation table created using `str.maketrans()`. This approach ensures that all occurrences of vowels are removed while keeping non-vowel characters intact.

It is formatted and indented for better readability using four spaces for indentation. It also provides a concise one-line solution to remove vowels from any given text.

To handle empty inputs, corner cases, or validate against problematic scenarios, you can incorporate tests in a separate section of the script or use an appropriate testing framework like `pytest`. This would ensure thorough testing of the function's behavior across various scenarios.
