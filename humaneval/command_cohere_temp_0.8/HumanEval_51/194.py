Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def remove_vowels(text):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    return text.translate(str.maketrans("", "", vowels))
```

The function removes vowels from the input text using the `translate` method and a translation table created with `str.maketrans`. This approach ensures that all possible vowels (both lowercase and uppercase) are removed regardless of the input case. It also preserves any characters that are not vowels. The expected behavior for each test case is as follows:
- `remove_vowels('')`: Returns an empty string.
- `remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm")`: Returns 'bcdf\nghjklm', preserving non-vowels and separating lines.
- `remove_vowels('abcdef')`: Returns 'bcdf', similarly preserving non-vowels.
- `remove_vowels('aaaaa')`: Returns an empty string, as all characters are vowels.
- `remove_vowels('aaBAA')`: Returns 'B', preserving the non-vowel character 'B'.
- `remove_vowels('zbcd')`: Returns 'zbcd', not altering the input as it contains no vowels. 
This approach improves upon the previous implementation, which used a basic `if` statement and didn't handle all possible vowels or preserve non-vowel characters, resulting in suboptimal output.
