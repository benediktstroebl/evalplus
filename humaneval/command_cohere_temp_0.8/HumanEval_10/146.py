Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. """
    if not string:
        return string

    # Find the longest palindromic suffix.
    i = string.rfind(string[::-1])
    if i == -1:
        return string + string[::-1]

    return string[:i] + string[i:i][::-1]
```

This code defines a function `make_palindrome` that takes a string as input and returns the shortest palindrome that begins with the input string. The algorithm for doing this uses the idea of combining the input string with its reverse to create a palindrome. This algorithm efficiently finds the shortest palindrome by only reversing and appending to the input string as needed.
