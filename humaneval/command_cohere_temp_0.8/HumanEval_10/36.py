Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem using Python 3.9+ **str.center** method:
```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. """
    # Exploit string.center to find the center of the palindrome
    palindrome = string.center(len(string) // 2, str([]))
    return f"{string}{palindrome[::-1]}"
```

The `make_palindrome` function leverages `str.center` to find the center of the palindrome, half the length of the input string. The center is then combined with the beginning and end portions of the string to create the shortest palindrome. The other method for solving was given previously.
