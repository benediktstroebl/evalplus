Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem using Markdown code blocks:
```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    if not string:
        return string

    # Find the longest palindromic suffix
    i = string.rfind(string[::-1])

    # Reverse the prefix before the palindromic suffix
    prefix = string[:i] + string[i:i+1][::-1]

    return prefix + string[i+1:]
```

This code block implements the `make_palindrome` function, taking a string as input and returning the shortest palindrome that begins with the input string. The function utilizes two main steps:
1. Finding the longest postfix of the input string that is a palindrome. This is done using `string.rfind(string[::-1])`, which identifies the longest substring that is reversed and identical to a prefix.
2. Reversing the prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix and concatenating it to the input string. This ensures that any characters between the initial input string and the palindromic suffix are reversed, thus expanding the shortest palindrome possible.

The final output is the newly created palindrome if the input string is not already a palindrome itself.

The `is_palindrome` function, provided earlier, is a necessary supporting function for the `make_palindrome` function, although the latter does not depend on any specific implementation of palindrome testing. The `is_palindrome` function simply checks if a given string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.

Note: The `make_palindrome` function assumes that the input string is already validated as a string and is not an empty string, thus, no additional checks are performed on the input for those assumptions. 
This code block ensures that the result is a valid palindrome and conforms to the problem description. In contrast, the original formulation reverses the entire string and prefixes it to the input string, which may result in unnecessary characters that invalidate the shortest palindrome claim.
