Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. """
    if not string:
        return string

    # Find the longest palindromic suffix.
    i = len(string) - 1
    while i > 0 and not is_palindrome(string[i:]):
        i -= 1

    # Find the longest string prefix that precedes the palindromic suffix.
    j = 0
    while not is_palindrome(string[j:i]):
        j += 1

    return make_palindrome(string[:j] + string[i:j][::-1] + string[j:])
``` 

This code defines a function `make_palindrome` that takes a string as input and returns the shortest palindrome that begins with the supplied string. It utilizes the `is_palindrome` function to check for palindromes.

The algorithm works by first checking if the supplied string is empty. If so, it returns the string as it is already a palindrome.

Next, it identifies the longest palindromic suffix of the supplied string. It does this by starting from the end of the string and working backwards, checking each substring for palindrome status until it finds the beginning of the palindrome.

Following that, it locates the longest prefix of the string that comes before the palindromic suffix. This is achieved by starting from the beginning of the string and moving forward, checking each substring for palindrome status, until the end of the palindrome is reached.

Lastly, it constructs the shortest palindrome by combining the identified prefix, the reverse of the intervening string between the prefix and suffix, and the palindromic suffix. The result is returned as the output.

This algorithm efficiently finds the shortest palindrome possible from a given string, and its correctness is ensured by the `is_palindrome` function.
