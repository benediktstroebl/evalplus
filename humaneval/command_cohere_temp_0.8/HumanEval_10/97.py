Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. """
    if not string:
        return string
    
    # Find the longest palindromic suffix of the string.
    i = string.rfind(string[::-1])
    if i == -1:
        return string
    
    return string[:i] + string[i:i+1][::-1] + string[i+1:]
```

This code defines two functions:
- The `is_palindrome` function checks whether a given string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.
- The `make_palindrome` function takes an input string and constructs the shortest palindrome possible that starts with the input. If the input string is already a palindrome, it returns the same string. Otherwise, it identifies the longest palindromic suffix in the input and constructs the palindrome by concatenating the reversed complement of the prefix before the suffix and the rest of the input.

The `make_palindrome` function essentially leverages the fact that any string can be represented as a palindrome if sufficiently padded with inverse-ordered filler characters. It identifies the minimum necessary padding by locating the longest palindromic suffix and using its reverse as the padding for the prefix.
