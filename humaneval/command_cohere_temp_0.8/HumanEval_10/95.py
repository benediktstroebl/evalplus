Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    """ Returns true if string s is a palindrome, false otherwise """
    return s == s[::-1]

def make_palindrome(s: str) -> str:
    """ Returns the shortest palindrome string that starts with s """
    if not s:
        return s

    # find the position of the longest palindromic suffix
    max_len, palindromic_suffix_pos = 0, 0
    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        if is_palindrome(s[i:]):
            palindromic_suffix_pos = i
            max_len = max(max_len, i)

    # reverse the non-palindromic prefix and append to the palindromic suffix
    return make_palindrome(s[:palindromic_suffix_pos] + s[-(i+1):] + s[palindromic_suffix_pos:-(i+1)])
```

This code uses a recursive approach to construct the shortest palindrome possible from the given input. The `make_palindrome` function takes an input string `s` and finds the longest palindromic suffix in the string. Then it reverse the non-palindromic prefix and appends it to the palindromic suffix to make a new string. The process continues until the whole string becomes a palindrome. The output is the shortest palindrome that starts with the input string. 

The `is_palindrome` function checks if a given string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. 

Both functions are self-contained and can be reused freely in other code bases.  This solution has a time complexity of `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
