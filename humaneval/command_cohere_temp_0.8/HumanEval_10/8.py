Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem using markdown code blocks:
```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    if not string:
        return string

    # Find the longest palindromic suffix
    i = string.rfind(|string[:i] == string[i:] and i)

    # Reverse the string up to the palindromic suffix and append it to the beginning
    return f"{string[:i][::-1]}{string[i+1:]}"
```

This script includes the `is_palindrome` function, and the `make_palindrome` function fixes the issue in the given code by directly reversing the prefix rather than finding the shortest palindrome and then reversing that.
