Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    """ Returns true if string s is a palindrome, false otherwise """
    return s == s[::-1]

def make_palindrome(s: str) -> str:
    """ Returns the shortest palindrome string that starts with s, or an empty string if s is already a palindrome """
    if is_palindrome(s):
        return s

    # Find the longest palindromic suffix of s
    i = len(s) - 1
    while i > 0 and s[i] == s[i+1]:
        i -= 1

    if i == 0:
        return s + s[i:]

    # Find the shortest non-palindromic prefix of s
    j = 0
    while s[j] == s[i]:
        j += 1

    return s[j:] + s[i:i+j][::-1]
```

This code defines two functions: `is_palindrome`, which tests whether a given string is a palindrome; and `make_palindrome`, which returns the shortest palindrome that begins with the provided string. If the provided string is already a palindrome, it returns it as is. Otherwise, it finds the longest palindromic suffix of the string and uses it to construct the palindrome by adding reversed characters to the beginning of the string. The `make_palindrome` function essentially loops through the string and adds the reversed letters to the end of the non-matched section to create the palindrome. 
The code returns the updated string if a palindrome is created, or the original string if it was already a palindrome. A docstring is also included for each function to explain its purpose and how it works.  This helps provide clarity and understanding.  This approach takes advantage of the reversing technique to solve the problem in a concise and efficient manner.
