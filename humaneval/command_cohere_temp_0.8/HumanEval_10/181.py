Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem using Markdown code blocks:
```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    if not string:
        return string

    # Find the longest palindromic suffix
    i = len(string) - 1
    while i > 0 and string[i] == string[i - 1]:
        i -= 1

    # Reverse the prefix up to the palindromic suffix
    reversed_prefix = string[i:][::-1] + string[:i]
    return f"{reversed_prefix}{string[i:]}"
```

This code defines the `is_palindrome` function, which takes a string and determines whether or not it is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. Additionally, it includes the `make_palindrome` function, which accepts a string as input and generates the shortest palindrome possible that begins with the provided string. This is accomplished by locating the longest palindromic suffix in the given string and then reversing the prefix up to that suffix to combine it with the reversed suffix. The resulting concatenation produces the shortest palindrome that starts with the original string.
