Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem using Markdown code blocks:
```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    if not string:
        return string

    # Find the longest palindromic suffix
    i = len(string) - 1
    while i > 0 and string[i] == string[i - 1]:
        i -= 1

    # Find the longest non-palindromic prefix before the palindromic suffix
    j = 0
    while string[j] != string[i]:
        j += 1

    # Reverse the non-palindromic prefix and concatenate
    return make_palindrome(string[j:i] + string[j:i][::-1]) + string[j+1:]
```

This code defines two functions:
- The `is_palindrome` function checks if a given string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.
- The `make_palindrome` function takes a string as input and tries to expand it to form a palindrome. If the input is an empty string, it returns the empty string. Otherwise, it identifies the longest palindromic suffix of the string and the point before that suffix where a non-palindromic prefix ends. It then recursively calls `make_palindrome` on the non-palindromic prefix plus the reversed version of the suffix and appends the result to the input string from the point after the end of the non-palindromic prefix through the end of the string. The resulting string is returned if it is a palindrome, or the process is repeated until a palindrome is formed.
