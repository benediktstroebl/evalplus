Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    """ Returns true if string s is a palindrome, false otherwise """
    return s == s[::-1]

def make_palindrome(s: str) -> str:
    """ Returns the shortest palindrome string that starts with string s """
    if not s:
        return s

    # find the longest palindromic suffix
    i = len(s) - 1
    while i > 0 and not is_palindrome(s[i:]):
        i -= 1

    # find the shortest non-palindromic prefix
    j = 0
    while is_palindrome(s[:j]+s[i:i+j]):
        j += 1

    return make_palindrome(s[:j] + s[i:i+j][::-1] + s[j+1:])
```

This code defines two functions:
- The `is_palindrome` function takes a string as input and checks whether it is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse using slicing. It returns `True` if the string is a palindrome and `False` otherwise. 
- The `make_palindrome` function takes an input string and aims to create the shortest possible palindrome starting with the given string. It does so in two main steps:
  - Finds the longest palindromic suffix of the input string by iterating through it in reverse and checking for palindromes. It starts from the end of the string (`i = len(s) - 1`) and moves backward until it finds the beginning of the palindromic portion. 
  - Finds the shortest non-palindromic prefix of the input string by iterating through it and checking for non-palindromes. It starts from the beginning of the string (`j = 0`) and moves forward until it finds the end of the non-palindromic portion. 

The `make_palindrome` function uses the findings of the longest palindromic suffix and the shortest non-palindromic prefix to construct the new string, which is then returned. 

This code is self-contained and can be exported to work with languages like JavaScript, Swift, C++, or C# since the logic for palindrome testing and creation is encapsulated within the functions and does not rely on external libraries. 

Note: The `make_palindrome` function uses a recursive approach, which can be memory-intensive for large strings. If you're working with large inputs or need to optimize for memory, you might consider using an iterative approach or memoization to avoid redundant computations. Paired with the is_palindrome function, this makes a complete set of tools for testing and creating palindromes.  If used in a browser, the code will work with browser-based Python implementations like PyV8, PyJS, or transcrypt.
