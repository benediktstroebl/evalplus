Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of forming the shortest palindrome:
```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. """
    if not string:
        return string

    # Find the longest palindromic suffix.
    i = len(string) - 1
    while i > 0 and not is_palindrome(string[i:]):
        i -= 1

    # Find the longest string prefix that precedes the palindromic suffix.
    j = 0
    while not is_palindrome(string[j:i]):
        j += 1

    return make_palindrome(string[:j] + string[i:][::-1]) + string[j:]
``` 

This script defines a function `make_palindrome` that takes a string as an input and returns the shortest palindrome that begins with the input string.

The algorithm for doing this uses the fact that a string with odd length is already a palindrome, so it focuses on strings with even lengths. It first finds the index `i` of the longest palindromic suffix of the input string (the furthest index where the substring is a palindrome). It then finds the longest prefix index `j` of the original string where the substring up to index `i` is not a palindrome. The make_palindrome function is called recursively on the internal region of the string, and the prefix up to index `j` and the suffix after index `i` are then concatenated onto the result. This process continues until the length of the string is 1, at which point the palindrome is complete. The final string is then returned. 

This approach helps find the shortest possible palindrome by using a divide-and-conquer technique. 

Note that the `is_palindrome` function is reused from the previous prompt for efficiently checking if a string is a palindrome.
