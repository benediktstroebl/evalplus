Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem using markdown code blocks:
```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    if not string:
        return string

    # Find the longest palindromic suffix
    i = string.rfind(string[::-1])

    # Reverse the prefix up to the palindromic suffix
    new_string = string[:i] + string[i:][::-1]
    return new_string
```

This script defines a function `make_palindrome` that takes a string as input and returns the shortest palindrome that begins with the supplied string. It works by first finding the longest palindromic suffix of the supplied string. If the entire string is a palindrome, it simply returns the string. Otherwise, it reverses and concatenates a prefix of the string to the reversed suffix to create a new shorter palindrome. The `i` variable is used to track the index of the longest palindromic suffix. The result is a palindrome composed of the original prefix and the reversed suffix, which is the shortest possible palindrome starting with the original string.
