Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    """ Returns true if string s is a palindrome, false otherwise """
    return s == s[::-1]

def make_palindrome(s: str) -> str:
    """ Returns the shortest palindrome string that starts with s, or an empty string if s is already a palindrome """
    if is_palindrome(s):
        return s

    # Find the longest palindromic suffix of s
    i = len(s) - 1
    while i > 0 and s[i] != s[i-1]:
        i -= 1
    if i == 0:
        return make_palindrome(s + s)

    # Find the longest non-palindromic prefix of the suffix
    j = i
    while s[j] == s[i]:
        j -= 1
    if s[j] == s[i]:
        return make_palindrome(s[j:] + s[i:-i] + s[j:])

    return make_palindrome(s[i:] + s[:i])
```

This code defines two functions:
- The `is_palindrome` function determines whether a given string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.
- The `make_palindrome` function is designed to return the shortest palindrome string that starts with the input string `s`. If `s` is already a palindrome, it returns an empty string. 
The process is achieved by:
1. If the input string is already a palindrome, it is directly returned as there is no need to modify it.
2. If the longest palindromic suffix of the string can be found, the function reconstructs the shortest palindrome by combining the suffix with a reversed version of the non-palindromic prefix of the suffix.
3. If the longest palindromic suffix doesn't have a non-palindromic prefix, the function simply appends the reversed suffix to the string. 

The function then recursively calls itself to optimize the result until the shortest palindrome is formed.
