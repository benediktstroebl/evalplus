Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. """
    if not string:
        return string

    # Find the longest palindromic suffix.
    i = string.rfind(string[::-1])
    if i == -1:
        return string + string[0:]

    # Find the closest prefix to the suffix that forms a palindrome.
    j = string.rfind(string[:i][::-1])
    if j == -1:
        return string + string[0:]

    return string[:j] + string[i:] + string[:j][::-1]
```

This code defines a function `make_palindrome` that takes a string as input and returns the shortest palindrome that begins with the input string. The function uses two techniques to achieve this:
1. Finding the longest palindromic suffix of the input string, and
2. Appending to the input string a reverse complement of the shortest prefix that forms a palindrome with that suffix.

This approach ensures the resulting string is a palindrome and as short as possible relative to the input string.

The `is_palindrome` function is also provided to test if a given string is a palindrome. This function simply compares the input string with its reverse using slicing.
