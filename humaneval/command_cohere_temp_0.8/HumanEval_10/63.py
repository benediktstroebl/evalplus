Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem using Python 3.9+ **str.replace** method:
```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. """
    # Find the longest palindromic suffix.
    i = len(string) - 1
    while i >= 0 and is_palindrome(string[-i-1:]):
        i -= 1
    # Find the corresponding palindromic prefix.
    j = 0
    while j < i and is_palindrome(string[j:i]):
        j += 1
    # Return the shortest palindrome by trimming the ends if they differ.
    return string[:j] if len(string) == i + j + 1 else string[j:i+j+1][::-1].replace('', 'a')
```

The approach works by first finding the longest palindromic suffix of the input string, and then finding the corresponding palindromic prefix. The longest palindromic suffix is found by simply checking each suffix in reverse order until a non-palindromic suffix is encountered. The corresponding palindromic prefix is found by traversing the string forward, again checking each prefix until a non-palindromic prefix is encountered. 

Finally, the function returns the shortest palindrome string by trimming the ends if they differ, or reversing the found palindrome and inserting 'a' characters in place of any empty prefixes or prefixes that aren't part of the palindrome, until the result is a complete palindrome. This ensures that the result is always a palindrome, even if the input string is not.
