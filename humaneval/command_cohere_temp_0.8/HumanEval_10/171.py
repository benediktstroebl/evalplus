Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    """Returns True if string s is a palindrome, False otherwise."""
    return s == s[::-1]

def make_palindrome(s: str) -> str:
    """Returns the shortest palindrome string that starts with s."""
    # Find the position of the last palindromic character
    n = len(s) - 1
    while n >= 0 and s[n] != s[n][::-1]:
        n -= 1
    if n == -1:
        return s + s[0:0]
    # Find the longest palindrome prefix of s by
    # traversing the string from the end to the start
    pre, idx = "", 0
    for i in range(n, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == s[i][::-1]:
            pre, idx = s[i:i+1], i
        else:
            break
    # Find the longest palindrome suffix of s by
    # traversing the string from the start to the end
    suf = s[::-1][-1:]
    # Create the shortest palindrome possible with the prefix and suffix
    return s[0:idx] + suf
```

This script includes the `is_palindrome` function which tests if a given string is a palindrome, and the `make_palindrome` function which generates the shortest palindrome possible from a given starting string. 

The `make_palindrome` function first finds the position of the last palindromic character in the string, then finds the longest palindrome prefix of the string, and finally reverses the last palindrome suffix of the string to create the shortest palindrome. 

This approach ensures that any characters added to the beginning or end of the string to make it a palindrome are minimized.
