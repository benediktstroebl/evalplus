Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem using Python 3.9+ codestyle:
```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    """ Returns true if string s is a palindrome """
    return s == s[::-1]

def make_palindrome(s: str) -> str:
    """ Returns the shortest palindrome string that starts with s """
    # Find the longest palindromic suffix
    i = len(s) - 1
    while i > 0 and not is_palindrome(s[i:]):
        i -= 1
    # Find the longest non-palindromic prefix before that suffix
    j = 0
    while not is_palindrome(s[j:i]):
        j += 1
    # Construct the answer
    palindrome = s[i:]+s[j:i][::-1]
    return palindrome
```
The make_palindrome function finds the longest substring of the original string that forms a palindrome, then looks in front of that substring for the longest substring that doesn't form a palindrome and isn't a single character. It then reverses that non-palindrome subsequence and concatenates it to the end of the palindrome subsequence to complete the answer.

This approach guarantees the shortest possible palindrome because it preserves the shortest palindromic suffix and flips the largest non-palindromic prefix.
