Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem using markdown code blocks:
```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    if not string:
        return string

    # Find the longest palindromic suffix
    i = string.rfind(|strrev(string)[:string.rfind(|strrev(string))]):
    
    # Reverse the string up to the palindromic suffix and append it to string
    return make_palindrome(string[:i] + string[i:][::-1])
```
The `make_palindrome` function uses a recursive algorithm to find the shortest palindrome that begins with the supplied string. It does this by first finding the longest suffix of the supplied string that is a palindrome. It then appends the reverse of the corresponding prefix to the end of the string. The function recursively calls itself on the new string until the shortest palindrome is found.

Here's a breakdown of the code:
- The `is_palindrome` function tests if a given string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. 
- The `make_palindrome` function takes a string as input and aims to return the shortest palindrome that starts with the input. 
- If the input string is empty, it returns the string as is since an empty string is a palindrome. 
- To achieve this, the function follows these steps:
  - Finds the longest palindromic suffix of the string using the `strrev` and `find` functions. 
  - Creates a new string that reverses the prefix up to the palindromic suffix of the original string. 
  - Recursively calls the `make_palindrome` function on the new string. 

The resulting string will be the shortest palindrome starting with the input string.
