Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    """Returns true if string s is a palindrome, false otherwise."""
    return s == s[::-1]

def make_palindrome(s: str) -> str:
    """Returns the shortest palindrome that starts with the given string s."""
    if not s:
        return s

    # Find the position of the longest palindromic suffix.
    longest_palindrome_suffix_idx = len(s) - len(s)[::-1].find_longest_match(s, 0, len(s))

    # Extract the reverse of the shortest prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    reversed_prefix = s[:longest_palindrome_suffix_idx][::-1]

    # Construct the shortest palindrome by concatenating the original string,
    # the reverse of the prefix, and the original palindromic suffix.
    return s + reversed_prefix + s[longest_palindrome_suffix_idx:]
```

This code defines two functions:
- The `is_palindrome` function checks whether a given string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.
- The `make_palindrome` function constructs the shortest palindrome possible by concatenating the given string with a reverse half of it. The half is calculated as the reverse of the shortest prefix of the original string that comes before the position of the longest palindromic suffix. The result is the shortest palindrome that starts with the given string.

The given example tests for the correctness of the `make_palindrome` function. It creates three different scenarios and passes them to the `make_palindrome` function and checks whether the returned string is a correct palindrome.
