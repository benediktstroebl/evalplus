Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. """
    if not string:
        return string

    # Find the longest palindromic suffix.
    i = string.rfind(string[::-1])
    if i == -1:
        return string + string[::-1]

    return string[:i] + string[i:i][::-1]
```

This code defines a function `make_palindrome` that takes a string as input and returns the shortest palindrome that begins with the input string. The function uses the concept of a "palindromic suffix" of a string, which is the longest substring of the string that is also a palindrome. 

The algorithm works by first checking if the input string is empty. If it is, then the input string is already a palindrome, so the function returns the string unchanged. 

If the input string is not empty, the function proceeds to find the longest palindromic suffix of the string. This is done using the `string.rfind()` method, which finds the index of the substring that matches the reverse of the substring. 

The function then uses the index of the palindromic suffix to slice the input string into two parts: the prefix and the suffix. The function then reverses the suffix and concatenates it to the prefix to form the shortest palindrome. 

The function returns the resulting string, which is the shortest palindrome that begins with the input string. 

The `is_palindrome` function is also provided to test if a given string is a palindrome or not. This function simply compares the input string with its reverse using slicing (`string[::-1]`). 

Overall, the provided solution has a time complexity of `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input string, and a space complexity of `O(1)`, making it an efficient solution for finding the shortest palindrome. 

Note: The code assumes that the string passed to the `make_palindrome` function is not empty. If the input string is empty, the function will return the empty string as the shortest palindrome. This assumption is made to simplify the implementation and focus on the core logic of the algorithm.  If you want to handle the case of empty strings separately, you may need to add additional checks in the function.
