Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    """Returns true if string s is a palindrome, false otherwise."""
    return s == s[::-1]

def make_palindrome(s: str) -> str:
    """Returns the shortest palindrome string that starts with s."""
    # Find the position of the last palindromic character
    # in the string or the length of the string if none is found.
    i = len(s) - 1
    while i > 0 and s[i-1] != s[i]:
        i -= 1
    if i == 0:
        return s + s[0:1]
    else:
        # Find the longest string prefix that is a palindrome
        j = i
        while j < len(s)//2 and s[j] == s[len(s)-j-1]:
            j += 1
        return s[i:j+1] + make_palindrome(s[j+1:])
```

This code uses two functions to solve the problem. The `is_palindrome` function takes a string as input and checks whether it is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse using slicing. The `make_palindrome` function takes a string as input and returns the shortest palindrome string that starts with the input string.

To do this, it follows these steps:
1. Find the position of the last palindromic character in the input string or the length of the string if none is found.
2. If the position of the last palindromic character is the length of the string, then the input string is already a palindrome, so it is returned unchanged.
3. Otherwise, find the longest string prefix that is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end of the string, starting from the position of the last palindromic character.
4. Append the reverse of the palindromic prefix to the end of the input string.
5. Return the newly constructed string and the process repeats until the resulting string becomes a palindrome.

Note that this approach does not require any additional modules and has a low time complexity of O(n) since it only requires one pass through the input string. The space complexity is O(1) since it does not require any additional lists or arrays.
