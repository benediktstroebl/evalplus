```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    even_exchange = False
    for i in range(len(lst1)):
        if lst1[i] % 2 == 0:
            even_exchange |= lst2[i] % 2
        else:
            even_exchange &= lst2[i] % 2 == 0
    if even_exchange:
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"
```

The function examines each element of both lists using bitwise operations to determine whether an even number in `lst1` can be matched with an odd number in `lst2`, and vice versa. It returns "YES" if every element in `lst1` can be paired with an element in `lst2` to create an even-numbered list. If not, it returns "NO". This process is entirely self-contained within the function, requiring no external adjustments to the lists.  This solution provides a concise and efficient way to solve the problem.  It is important to note that this approach provides a solution in a single function, without the need for complex data manipulation.
