```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    o = [x for x in lst1 if x % 2 == 0]
    e = [x for x in lst2 if x % 2 == 0]
    if len(o) == len(lst1):
        return "YES"
    elif len(e) == len(lst2):
        return "NO"
```
The code defines a function exchange that takes two lists lst1 and lst2 as input. It checks if it's possible to exchange elements from lst2 with elements from lst1 to make lst1 contain only even numbers. The function does this by creating two separate lists: o for odd numbers and e for even numbers from both lst1 and lst2.

It then checks the length of o and e to determine if it's possible to exchange elements to make lst1 contain only even numbers. If the length of o is equal to the length of lst1, it means we can exchange all the odd numbers with even numbers from lst2 to make lst1 consist only of even numbers, so the function returns "YES". Otherwise, if the length of e is equal to the length of lst2, it means there aren't enough even numbers in lst2 to exchange for the odd numbers in lst1, so the function returns "NO".
