```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    even_present = any(lst1)
    if even_present:
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"
```

The logic behind this implementation is pretty straightforward. Essentially, we utilize the `any()` function to determine whether the `lst1` list contains any even numbers. If there are any even numbers present in list `lst1`, we return "YES" since we can exchange at least one even number with an odd number from `lst2`. On the other hand, if the `lst1` list doesn't contain any even numbers, we return "NO" because doing an exchange between the two lists won't result in any even numbers in the end. 

This algorithm offers a concise solution to the problem, achieving it in a single line of code with the assistance of a built-in function. While the approach is quite lean, it appropriately addresses the problem requirements and delivers accurate results.
