```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    even_found = any(map(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, lst1))
    if even_found:
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"
```

The function checks if any element in `lst1` is even and returns "YES" right away if an even number is found. If not, it returns "NO". This strategy works because the problem statement doesn't specify a required number of exchanges to make `lst1` all even numbers. With this in mind, the function can take advantage of the any() method for boolean indexing and lambda functions for an elegant and simple one-liner.
