```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    even_found = any(map(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, lst1))
    count_diff_ev = sum(x % 2 == 0 for x in lst2) - even_found
    return "YES" if count_diff_ev >= 0 else "NO"
```

The method uses simple logic and modularity to solve the problem. It first identifies whether there are any even numbers in `lst1` by employing `any()` and a lambda function for the filter operation. Subsequently, it calculates the count difference of even numbers between `lst2` and `lst1` using a generator expression and `sum()` to determine whether the exchange can yield a list of even numbers. The outcome is returned as a "YES" if the count difference is sufficient or above zero, and "NO" otherwise. 

To ensure the optimal solution's effectiveness and efficiency, it is recommended to not alter the inherent logic but rather optimize the implementation, such as by enhancing the readability or refactoring the code. 

This approach allows for a straightforward determination of even numbers and a calculation of the count difference, ultimately leading to an efficient solution.
