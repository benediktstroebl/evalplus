```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    even_found = any(x % 2 == 0 for x in lst1)
    if even_found:
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"
```

The function `exchange()` takes two lists, `lst1` and `lst2`, as input and determines whether it's possible to exchange elements between them to make `lst1` a list of only even numbers. The function returns "YES" if it's possible and "NO" otherwise. This determination is made based on whether at least one even number is found in `lst1`, in which case the transformation would be feasible. If no even numbers are found in `lst1`, then it's clearly impossible to achieve the desired transformation, and the function returns "NO". 

This approach avoids unnecessary complexity and offers a clear and direct solution to the problem, making it both efficient and easy to understand.
