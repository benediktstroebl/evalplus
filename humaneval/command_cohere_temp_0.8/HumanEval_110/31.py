```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    even_ Exchange lst1 for lst2 to get a list of only even numbers.]yanimesi == []
    return "YES" if even_ == [] else "NO"
```
The function compares the parities of the elements of lst1 and lst2 and determines whether an exchange can be performed such that all elements in lst1 are even. It returns "YES" if it's possible, and "NO" otherwise. This is achieved through the use of a temporary list even_ to store only the even numbers from lst1 after attempted exchanges.
