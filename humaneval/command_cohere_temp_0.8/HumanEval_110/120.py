```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    o = [x for x in lst1 if x%2 == 0]
    e = [x for x in lst2 if x%2 == 0]
    if len(o) == len(lst1):
        return "YES"
    elif len(e) == len(lst2):
        return "NO"
```
The code defines a function exchange that takes two lists lst1 and lst2 as input. It aims to determine whether it's possible to exchange elements between these lists such that lst1 contains only even numbers. To do this, it creates two separate lists: o (for odd) and e (for even). Both lists are populated with elements from lst1 and lst2, respectively, based on their parity. After constructing these lists, it checks their lengths compared to the original lists. If the length of o is equal to the length of lst1, it means all elements in lst1 were odd, and an exchange can be made to achieve the goal, so the function returns "YES". Conversely, if the length of e is equal to the length of lst2, it means all even numbers from lst2 have already been moved to lst1, indicating no exchange can make lst1 consist of only even numbers, so the function returns "NO". The expected response is returned based on these checks.
