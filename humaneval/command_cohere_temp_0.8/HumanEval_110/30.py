```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    o = [x for x in lst1 if x%2 == 0]
    e = [x for x in lst2 if x%2 == 0]
    if len(o) == len(lst1):
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"
```
This Python script provides a function `exchange` that takes two lists, `lst1` and `lst2` as input, and returns "YES" if it is possible to exchange elements between them so that `lst1` contains only even numbers. If it is not possible to modify `lst1` to contain only even numbers, the function returns "NO". The function tests for equality in length between the odd-even concatenation of `lst1` and does the same for `lst2`, and returns "YES" if they are equal and "NO" if they are not. Would you like to know how it works or anything else I can help you with?
