```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    odd = False
    for x in lst1:
        if x % 2:
            odd = not odd
    if odd:
        return "NO"
    else:
        return "YES"
```
This code defines a function `exchange` that takes two lists of numbers `lst1` and `lst2` as input. It examines whether it is possible to exchange elements from `lst2` with `lst1` to create a list of only even numbers in `lst1`. The function checks if there is at least one odd number in `lst1` by toggling a boolean variable `odd` as it iterates through the list. If there is at least one odd number in `lst1`, it returns "NO" since an even number exchange cannot be made. If there are no odd numbers in `lst1`, it returns "YES" as an even exchange can be made. This function efficiently solves the problem without explicitly exchanging elements, using a more concise approach. 

Here is a simpler alternative approach to the problem that also avoids explicit element swapping:
```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    return "YES" if all(x % 2 == 0 for x in lst1) and any(x % 2 != 0 for x in lst2) else "NO"
```
This code directly evaluates the final goal of the task, determining if all elements in `lst1` are even, and if there is at least one odd number in `lst2`. It does so in a straightforward fashion, using `all` and `any` functions applied to the sequence of expressions arising from tuple unpacking. 

Both approaches take into account the clarification and simplify the problem and its solution. Let's take the simpler approach as the right solution.
