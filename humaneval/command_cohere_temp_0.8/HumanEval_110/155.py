```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    even_exchange = False
    for i in range(len(lst1)):
        if lst1[i] % 2 == 0:
            even_exchange |= lst2[i] % 2
        else:
            even_exchange &= lst2[i] % 2 == 0
    if even_exchange:
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"
```

The function examines each element of both lists. It utilizes the bitwise `|` operator to set the `even_exchange` flag to `True` if the current element of `lst1` is even and the current element of `lst2` is odd, and vice versa. Finally, if the `even_exchange` flag is `True`, it returns "YES," and if not, it returns "NO." 

This approach takes advantage of the symmetry of the problem, where exchanging odd elements with even ones maintains the property that all elements in the result are even.
