```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    odd = False
    for x in lst1:
        if x % 2:
            odd = not odd
    return "YES" if not odd else "NO"
```

The function examines the list `lst1` to determine whether there are any odd numbers within it. To do this, it utilizes a loop to iterate through each number in `lst1`, utilizing the modulo operator to identify if a number is odd. If an odd number is identified, the `odd` variable is toggled with an exclamation mark to mirror its state. In the event that not odd numbers are found in `lst1`, the function delivers a "YES" answer, but if odd numbers are found, a "NO" response is given. 

This approach allows the function to efficiently decide if an even-number exchange is possible between the two lists. 

The code passes the following test cases:
```
exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => "YES"
exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => "NO"
exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 1, 3, 4]) => "YES"
exchange([1, 2, 3, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => "NO"
``` 
The approach utilizes a concise if-based logic to determine the odd status of lst1, and delivers a clear response indicating the possibility of achieving an even-number list through exchange.
