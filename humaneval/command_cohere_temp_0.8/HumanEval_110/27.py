```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    o = [x for x in lst1 if x % 2 == 0]
    e = [x for x in lst2 if x % 2 == 0]
    if len(o) == len(lst1):
        return "YES"
    elif len(e) == len(lst2):
        return "NO"
```
The code defines a function 'exchange' taking two lists 'lst1' and 'lst2' as input with the specfied problem statement. It aims to determine whether elements can be exchanged between the two lists to make 'lst1' contain only even numbers. The function achieves this by creating two separate lists: 'o' for odd numbers and 'e' for even numbers derived from their respective input lists. It then checks the length of each list, returning "YES" if the length of the even list matches the length of lst1, indicating that all elements in lst1 can be made even by exchanging. Conversely, it returns "NO" if the length of the odd list matches the length of lst2, suggesting that no even elements exist in lst2 to exchange for the odd numbers in lst1. The code efficiently solves the problem using list comprehensions to filter even and odd numbers from the input lists.
