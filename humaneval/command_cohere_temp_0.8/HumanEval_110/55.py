```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    even_found = any(map(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, lst1))
    count_even = sum(1 for x in lst1 if x % 2 == 0)
    count_odd = len(lst1) - count_even
    return "YES" if even_found and count_odd >= count_even :
        print(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]))
        print(exchange([1, 5, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]))
        print(exchange([1, 2, 3, 5, 7], [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]))
    else:
        return "NO"
```
The function employs a simple algorithm that checks whether at least one even number is present in the first list (**`lst1`**), and if the number of odd numbers is greater or equal to the number of even numbers in **`lst1`**; if both conditions are true, the function returns "YES," and if not, it returns "NO." 

Here is a simplified breakdown of the code in the exchange function:
1. **`even_found = any(map(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, lst1)):`** This line checks if there are any even numbers in **`lst1`** using the **`any`** function and a map function that evaluates the condition **`x % 2 == 0`** for each element **`x`** in **`lst1`**.
2. **`count_even = sum(1 for x in lst1 if x % 2 == 0):`** This line uses a generator expression to count the number of even numbers in **`lst1`** (the generator expression **`1 for x in lst1 if x % 2 == 0`** generates a sequence of **`1`** s for each even number in **`lst1`** ).
3. **`count_odd = len(lst1) - count_even:`** This line calculates the number of odd numbers in **`lst1`** by subtracting the count of even numbers from the total length of **`lst1`**.
4. **`return "YES" if even_found and count_odd >= count_even:`** This line checks if the conditions are met and returns "YES" if it is possible to exchange elements to make **`lst1`** all even numbers. 

The function assumes that the length of both lists is not equal, as otherwise, the problem would not have a definitive solution. You can freely test the function on other input lists to observe its behavior and ensure its correctness.  In essence, the function determines if the number of odd numbers in **`lst1`** can be used to replace the count of even numbers in **`lst2`**, allowing **`lst1`** to contain only even numbers.  If this condition is satisfied, it returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO".  This problem illustrates the use of Python's built-in functions and list manipulation for functional coding.  It also showcases the use of conditional checking for problem resolution.  The code is designed to be reusable and modular, capable of solving various related problems efficiently and adaptively.
