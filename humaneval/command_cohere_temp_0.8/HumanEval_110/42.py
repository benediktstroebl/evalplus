```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    even_ Exchange lst1 for lst2 to get a list of only even numbers.]IRST_LIST = []
    ODD_LIST = []
    for num in lst1:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            EVEN_LIST.append(num)
        else:
            ODD_LIST.append(num)
    for num in lst2:
        if num % 2 == 0 and num not in EVEN_LIST:
            EVEN_LIST.append(num)
        elif num % 2 != 0 and num not in ODD_LIST:
            ODD_LIST.append(num)
    if len(EVEN_LIST) == len(lst1):
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"
```
The following things happen in the code:
1. Using two empty lists to represent even and odd numbers, it separates the two lists' elements into even and odd numbers.
2. The odd numbers missing from the `lst2` are appended to the odd-even split list. Similarly, the even numbers missing from `lst1` are appended to the even list.
3. The function returns "YES" if the two lists are equal in length after the assignment, meaning it was possible to exchange the elements, but it returns "NO" if it is impossible to assign them all.

The code should output "YES" for the input `[1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]` and "[1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]" and "NO" for `[1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 3, 5, 4]` and `[1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 0, 3, 4]`.
