```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    even_found = any(x % 2 == 0 for x in lst1)
    if even_found:
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"
```

The function examines whether any member of the `lst1` list is even. If so, it returns "YES" since at least one even number needs to be exchanged. Otherwise, it returns "NO". 

### Example Usage:
```python
print(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]))  # Output: "NO"
```
