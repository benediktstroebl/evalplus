```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    odd = False
    for x in lst1:
        if x % 2:
            odd = not odd
    if odd:
        return "NO"
    else:
        return "YES"
```
This code defines a function `exchange` that takes two lists `lst1` and `lst2` as input. It checks if there is an element in `lst1` that is odd and furthermore, it toggles the `odd` variable if an odd element is found. If at the end of the loop the `odd` variable is still `False`, it means that all elements in `lst1` are even, and therefore it returns the string `YES`. Otherwise, it returns the string `NO`. 

Such a solution assumes that the problem asks specifically for a determination of the possibility to exchange elements, and not to perform the exchange process itself. Let's make this code more versatile and robust by adding some tests, modifying the function to handle empty lists, and handling the case when lists have different lengths. Here is the updated code:
```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    if not lst1 or not lst2:
        return "Empty lists"
    odd = False
    for x in lst1:
        if x % 2:
            odd = not odd
        elif x in lst2:
            lst2.remove(x)
    if odd:
        return "NO"
    elif len(lst2) == 0:
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"
```

In the updated version of the code, the following improvements have been made:
1. Added a condition to handle empty lists at the beginning of the function.
2. Inside the loop, an additional condition is added to check if the current element `x` is present in `lst2`. If it is, this means that it can be swapped to `lst1` to make an even list, and we remove it from `lst2` using the `remove` method.
3. At the end of the loop, the function checks if the `odd` variable is still `False` and if the `lst2` is empty. If both conditions are met, it means that all the elements of `lst1` are even, and none of them is present in `lst2`, so we return "YES". 
4. If the loop ended without toggling the `odd` variable, and there is at least one element in `lst2`, we return "NO". 

This solution provides a more versatile function that can handle a wider variety of cases.
