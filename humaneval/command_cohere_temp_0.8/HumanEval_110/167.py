```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    o = [x for x in lst1 if x % 2 == 0]
    e = [x for x in lst2 if x % 2 == 0]
    if len(o) == len(lst1):
        return "YES"
    elif len(e) == len(lst2):
        return "NO"
```
The code defines a function exchange that takes two lists lst1 and lst2 as input. It aims to determine whether it's possible to exchange elements between these lists such that lst1 contains only even numbers. To do this, it creates two separate lists: o (odd elements) and e (even elements) from lst1 and lst2, respectively. Then, it checks the lengths of these lists. If the length of o is equal to the length of lst1, it means all elements in lst1 are even, and the function returns "YES." Otherwise, if the length of e is equal to the length of lst2, it means there aren't enough even elements in lst2 to make lst1 all even, so it returns "NO." 

Here is an example of how you can call this function with sample input: 
 ```python
print(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4])) # Prints "NO"
``` 
And here is another example:
```python
print(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 4, 6, 8])) # Prints "YES"
``` 
This will help you determine whether it is possible to exchange elements between the two lists to make all the elements in lst1 even.
