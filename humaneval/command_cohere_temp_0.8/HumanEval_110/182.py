```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    even_found = any(x % 2 == 0 for x in lst1)
    if even_found:
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"
```

The function examines whether any member of the `lst1` list is even. If so, it returns "YES" since at least one even number must be exchanged with an odd number from `lst2` in order to make all elements in `lst1` even. If not, it returns "NO," as it is impossible to select any number from `lst2` to exchange with any number in `lst1` without introducing an odd number. 

This approach takes advantage of the problem statement's presumption that the input lists will include at least one even number. Using Python's built-in `any` function, this method determines whether any element in `lst1` satisfies the condition that it is an even number. As a result, it is a highly effective use of the problem specification. 

This approach does not explicitly loop through the lists or introduce any additional variables. Therefore, it is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. It is a concise and elegant solution to the problem.
