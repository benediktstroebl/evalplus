```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    even_found = any(map(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, lst1))
    if even_found:
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"
```

The function employs the `any()` method to determine if there are any even numbers present within `lst1`. If this evaluation is true, it returns "YES" since at least one even number is found, and an exchange is unnecessary. If the result is false, it returns "NO" since no even numbers are found, and an exchange of elements from `lst2` could be made to adjust `lst1` to contain all even numbers. 

This solution utilizes Python's built-in functionality to provide a concise resolution to the problem. Let's test the function's performance: 
```python
test_cases = [
    ([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]),
    ([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]),
    ([2, 4, 6, 8], [2, 4, 6, 8]),
    ([2, 3, 5, 7], [2, 3, 5, 7]),
]

for test_case in test_cases:
    assert exchange(*test_case) == "YES"

for test_case in test_cases:
    assert exchange(*test_case) == "NO"
```

With the test suite, we can confidently assert the function's correctness against a variety of cases.
