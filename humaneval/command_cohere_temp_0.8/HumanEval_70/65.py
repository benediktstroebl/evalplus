This code block contains a function called `strange_sort_list` that takes a list of integers as input and returns that list in a strange order. This strange order is defined as follows: start with the minimum value, then take the maximum value of the remaining integers, then the minimum value of the remaining, and so on until we have iterated through all items. This continues until there are no more items left in the list. The function handles the edge case where the list is empty by returning an empty list.

The code block also includes tests for the function in the form of assert statements with expected output values. These tests check that the function behaves as expected for a variety of input lists, including edge cases like empty lists and lists with multiple instances of the same number.
