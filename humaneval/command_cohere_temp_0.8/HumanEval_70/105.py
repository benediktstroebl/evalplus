```python
def strange_sort_list(lst):
    result = []
    while lst:
        min_val = min(lst)
        lst.remove(min_val)
        result.append(min_val)
        max_val = max(lst)
        lst.remove(max_val)
        result.append(max_val)
    return result
```

The code initiates an empty result list onto which we'll append the sorted elements. The main loop runs until the input list is not empty. Inside the loop, we first find the minimum value in the list, remove it from the list, and append it to the result. Then, we find the maximum value in the remaining list, remove it, and append it to the result. This generates the 'strange' sorting order: min-max-min-max and so on. The empty list case is handled as the loop doesn't initiate without an edge case. The code successfully passes the given test cases. 
The test cases can be added as:
```python
test_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
assert strange_sort_list(test_list) == [1, 4, 2, 3]

test_list = [5, 5, 5, 5]
assert strange_sort_list(test_list) == [5, 5, 5, 5]

test_list = []
assert strange_sort_list(test_list) == []
``` 
This would ensure the function behaves as expected.
