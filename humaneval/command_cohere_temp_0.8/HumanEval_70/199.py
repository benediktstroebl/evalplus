This Python script defines a function called `strange_sort_list` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of those integers sorted in a specific order. The sorting pattern used in this function is nicknamed "strange sorting," which starts with the smallest value in the list, then adds the largest remaining integer to the partially sorted list, then the second-smallest remaining integer, and so on. This results in a sort of "see-saw" effect, alternating between the smallest and largest values as the list is sorted.

The function uses a minimum and maximum index to find the extreme values of the list, initially set to the first element's indexes. It then appends the smallest value to the `sorted_list`, which is initialized as an empty list. The function then loops through the rest of the list, comparing each element to the largest current value (at the `max_idx`) and the smallest current value (at the `min_idx`). If it encounters a larger value, it updates the `max_idx`. If it encounters a smaller value, it updates the `min_idx`. The element at the current index is added to the `sorted_list` when the current index is greater than the `max_idx`, which indicates that it is the largest remaining element. This process continues until all elements are sorted in the strange order and added to the list.

The script includes examples in the comments to illustrate the behavior of the function, as per the problem statement. Overall, the provided code seems to accurately solve the problem with a clear explanation, fulfilling the request specified in the prompt.
