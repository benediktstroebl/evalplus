```python
def strange_sort_list(lst):
    # Initialize the minimum and maximum values
    min_val = min(lst)
    max_val = max(lst)
    
    # Initialize the result list with the initial min and max values
    result = [min_val, max_val]
    
    while len(lst) > 1:
        # Add the next smaller value (min) in the result list
        result.append(min(lst))
        # Remove the minimum value from the list (assuming it's not the last element)
        lst.remove(min_val)
        
        # Update the min and max values
        min_val = result[len(result) - 1]
        max_val = result[1]
        
        # Add the next larger value (max) in the result list
        result.append(max_val)
        # Remove the maximum value from the list (assuming it's not the last element)
        lst.remove(max_val)
    
    # Add the last remaining value in the list to the result
    result.append(max_val)
    
    return result
``` 

This Python script defines a function called `strange_sort_list` which takes in a list of integers (`lst`) as input. It sorts the list in a strange order as described in the problem statement. The function starts by finding the minimum and maximum values in the list and then alternates between adding the smallest and largest remaining values to a result list. The function continues this process until only one value remains in the list, which is then added to the result list.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4])) # Output: [1, 4, 2, 3]
``` 

And here is how the function's logic translates to a Markdown code block:
```python
def strange_sort_list(lst):
    # Initialize the minimum and maximum values
    min_val = min(lst)
    max_val = max(lst)
    
    # Initialize the result list with the initial min and max values
    result = [min_val, max_val]
    
    while len(lst) > 1:
        # Add the next smaller value (min) in the result list
        result.append(min(lst))
        # Remove the minimum value from the list (assuming it's not the last element)
        lst.remove(min_val)
        
        # Update the min and max values
        min_val = result[len(result) - 1]
        max_val = result[1]
        
        # Add the next larger value (max) in the result list
        result.append(max_val)
        # Remove the maximum value from the list (assuming it's not the last element)
        lst.remove(max_val)
    
    # Add the last remaining value in the list to the result
    result.append(max_val)
    
    return result
```
