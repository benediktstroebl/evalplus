Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the car crash problem as per the provided markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    # Initialize two lists to represent the positions of left and right moving cars
    left_cars = [i for i in range(n)]
    right_cars = [i for i in range(n, 2 * n)]

    # Loop to find collisions between the two lists of cars
    collisions = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if left_cars[i] == right_cars[i]:
            collisions += 1
        # Move the right-moving cars to the right by incrementing their positions
        right_cars[i + 1] = right_cars[i] + 1

    return collisions

# Test cases
print(car_race_collision(5))  # Expected: 10 collisions
print(car_race_collision(10))  # Expected: 45 collisions
```

This script defines the `car_race_collision` function, which takes in an integer `n` representing the number of cars. It initializes two lists, `left_cars`, and `right_cars`, representing the positions of the left-moving and right-moving cars, respectively. It then loops through the lists to compare car positions and count collisions, incrementing the speed of the right-moving cars. Finally, the function returns the number of collisions.
