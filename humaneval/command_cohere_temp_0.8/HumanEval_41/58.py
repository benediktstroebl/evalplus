Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the car collision problem as per the provided markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n):
    cars_left = n // 2
    cars_right = n - cars_left
    
    collisions = 0
    
    for i in range(cars_left):
        for j in range(cars_right):
            if i != j:
                collisions += 1
    
    return collisions

# Tests
assert car_race_collision(5) == 0
assert car_race_collision(6) == 1
assert car_race_collision(10) == 5
```

This script defines the `car_race_collision` function, which takes an integer `n` representing the number of cars as input. The function calculates the number of collisions between the two sets of cars moving in opposite directions. It does this by iterating through the indices of the first half of cars (moving left to right) and the second half of cars (moving right to left), checking for pairs of distinct indices that indicate a collision. The function then returns the total number of such collisions.

The script also includes test cases to validate the function's behavior for different values of `n`. You can further verify the function against additional test cases to ensure it matches your expectations.
