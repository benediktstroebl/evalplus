Here's a Python script that contains a function which solves the car collision problem as per the provided markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n):
    cars_left = n // 2
    cars_right = n - cars_left
    collisions = 0
    for i in range(cars_left):
        for j in range(cars_right):
            if i + j >= n:
                collisions += 1
    return collisions
```

This script includes a function called `car_race_collision(n)` which works in the following way:
1. Firstly, it calculates the number of cars driving left (`cars_left`) and right (`cars_right`) by dividing `n` by 2. This is because half of the cars are driving in each direction.
2. Then, it initializes the variable `collisions` to zero, which will count the number of collisions.
3. Next, it uses nested loops to iterate over all the possible pairs of cars. The outer loop (`for i in range(cars_left):`) considers each car driving left, and the inner loop (`for j in range(cars_right):`) considers each car driving right.
4. The condition `i + j >= n` checks if the sum of the indices of the left and right cars exceeds the total number of cars. This is true if the two cars collide, as the index would exceed the number of cars driving in one direction, considering the cars driving in the other direction.
5. If the condition is met, it means a collision has occurred, so the `collisions` variable is incremented by 1.
6. Lastly, the function returns the number of collisions.

This solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(n^2), which arises from the nested loops considering all pairs of cars.

This function can efficiently solve the problem and return the number of collisions between the two sets of cars. Feel free to ask any follow-up questions or request further clarifications!
