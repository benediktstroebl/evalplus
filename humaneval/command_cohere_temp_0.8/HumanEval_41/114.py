Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the car crash problem as per the provided Markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    # Initialize two lists to represent the positions of left and right moving cars
    left_cars = [i for i in range(n)]
    right_cars = [i for i in range(n)]
    
    # Initialize collision tracking variable
    collisions = 0
    
    # Iterate until both lists are equal in length (no more collisions)
    while len(left_cars) != len(right_cars):
        # Find first index of difference between left_cars and right_cars
        # If the first index is beyond the current length, move to the next step
        first_diff = left_cars[0] if len(left_cars) <= len(right_cars) else right_cars[0]
        
        for car in left_cars:
            if car != first_diff and right_cars[car] == car:
                # If there's a match, increment the collision count and remove the collided car from both lists
                collisions += 1
                left_cars.remove(car)
                right_cars.remove(car)
                break
        
        # Shuffle right_cars to the beginning of left_cars to simulate motion
        left_cars = right_cars + left_cars
        right_cars = []
    
    return collisions

# Test the function with a specific input
test_input = 5
expected_output = 4
result = car_race_collision(test_input)

if result == expected_output:
    print("Test successful!")
else:
    print("Test failed!")
```
This script defines the `car_race_collision` function as per the provided problem statement. It simulates the movement of the cars and detects collisions between the two moving sets of cars. Finally, it returns the number of collisions.

The test statement at the end checks if the function's output matches the expected output for a specific input. You can replace `test_input` and `expected_output` with your own values to test the function for different scenarios.
