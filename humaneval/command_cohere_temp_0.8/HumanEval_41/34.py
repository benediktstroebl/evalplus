Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the car crash problem as per the provided markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n):
    # Define 2 lists to hold the cars from each direction
    cars_left_to_right = list(range(n))
    cars_right_to_left = list(range(n))

    # Define 2 counters to keep track of collisions
    collisions_left_to_right = 0
    collisions_right_to_left = 0

    # Move each car in both directions in infinite time
    for i in range(n):
        # Move car i from left to right
        if cars_right_to_left[i] == cars_left_to_right[i]:
            collisions_left_to_right += 1
        else:
            cars_left_to_right.remove(cars_left_to_right[i])
            cars_left_to_right.append(cars_right_to_left[i])

        # Move car i from right to left
        if cars_left_to_right[i] == cars_right_to_left[i]:
            collisions_right_to_left += 1
        else:
            cars_right_to_left.remove(cars_right_to_left[i])
            cars_right_to_left.append(cars_left_to_right[i])

    return collisions_left_to_right, collisions_right_to_left

# Tests

    assert car_race_collision(3) == (1, 0)
    assert car_race_collision(7) == (4, 0)
    assert car_race_collision(15) == (12, 0)

    assert car_race_collision(4) == (0, 2)
    assert car_race_collision(8) == (0, 4)
    assert car_race_collision(16) == (0, 8)

test_car_race_collision()
```

This script defines the `car_race_collision` function which takes in a number of cars `n` as input and outputs the number of collisions for each set of cars. The function utilizes two lists to keep track of the cars moving from left to right and right to left respectively. Then, it loops through each car and adjusts the lists to simulate the cars moving in their respective directions. It keeps track of collisions using two counters and finally, returns the number of collisions for each set of cars.

The `test_car_race_collision` function includes a number of test cases to validate the correctness of the `car_race_collision` function. You can use the function with different values of `n` to test the function's behavior for various numbers of cars.
