Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the car crash problem as per the provided Markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    # Initialize two lists to keep track of cars on the left and right lanes
    cars_left = []
    cars_right = []

    # Simulate the movement of cars in both directions
    for _ in range(n): 
        # For each car, determine the index at which it would collide with a car in the other lane
        collision_idx = len(cars_right) - (len(cars_left) + 1)
        cars_left.append(collision_idx)
        cars_right.append(len(cars_right))
    
    # Determine the number of collisions by comparing car indices in both lanes
    collision_count = sum(abs(x - y) < 1 for x, y in zip(cars_left, cars_right))
    
    return collision_count
```

This function simulates the movement of cars in both directions, determines collision indices, and counts the number of collisions where car indices in both lanes are within a tolerance of each other (less than 1 in this case).

To test this function, you can add test cases in the same file using the `pytest` framework, or use the following test case to verify the function output:
```python
test_case = [
    (0, 0),
    (1, 0),
    (2, 0),
    (3, must_fail=True), 
    (4, must_fail=True), 
    (5, must_fail=True), 
    (6, 0), 
    (7, 0), 
    (8, 0), 
    (9, 0), 
    (10, 0)
]

for input, expected in test_case:
    result = car_race_collision(input)
    assert result == expected
```

This test case validates the function against several different inputs and expected outputs. 
The `must_fail=True` is a placeholder that doesn't necessarily imply an actual error; it's just meant to indicate that the expected output is `False` or an unexpected result. 
If the test case passes, you will get an `OK` result, and in the event that it fails, you will get a `FAIL` result along with the specific test case that caused the failure. 

I hope this solution and these tests help you achieve the desired result for the car race problem! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to assist with anything else.
