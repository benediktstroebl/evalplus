Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the car collision problem as per the provided markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    # Define two lists to store car positions for each team
    team1 = [i for i in range(n)]
    team2 = [i for i in range(n, 2 * n)]

    # Initialize collisions as 0
    collisions = 0

    # Loop through all possible pairs of cars
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i < n:
                if team1[i] + i <= team2[j]:
                    collisions += 1
            else:
                if team1[i] - (2 * n - i) <= team2[j]:
                    collisions += 1

    return collisions
```

This function calculates the number of collisions between cars moving left to right and cars moving right to left on an infinitely long straight road. It does so by creating two lists (`team1` and `team2`) to represent the positions of cars in both directions, and then iterating through all possible pairs of cars. For each pair, it checks if they collide by comparing their positions. If they collide, it increments the `collisions` counter.

To handle the case when a car from the left-to-right team reaches the far end of the road and "wraps around" to collide with a car coming from the right-to-left team, the function considers both the positive and negative indices of the `team1` list.

This solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of cars. It accounts for all possible collisions between the cars and correctly handles the wrap-around scenario at the edge of the road.
