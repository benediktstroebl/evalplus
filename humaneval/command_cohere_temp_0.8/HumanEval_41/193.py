Here's a Python script that contains a function which solves the car collision problem as per the provided markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n):
    cars_left = n // 2
    cars_right = n - cars_left
    collisions = 0
    for i in range(cars_left):
        for j in range(cars_right):
            if i + j >= n:
                collisions += 1
    return collisions

# Tests
assert car_race_collision(6) == 4
assert car_race_collision(10) == 5
assert car_race_collision(3) == 0
```
This code defines the `car_race_collision` function, which takes in a single argument `n`, the number of cars, and returns the number of collisions between the two sets of cars. 

The total number of cars is partitioned into two groups: `cars_left` contains the number of cars driving left to right, while `cars_right` contains the number of cars driving right to left. Using two nested loops, the function considers each car from the left group and each car from the right group, checking if their sum exceeds the total number of cars, which indicates a collision. The variable `collisions` is incremented each time a collision is identified. Finally, the function returns the total count of collisions. 

The tests assert that the function behaves as expected for different values of `n`.
