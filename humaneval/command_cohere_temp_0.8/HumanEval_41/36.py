Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the car crash problem as per the provided markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    # Define 2 lists to store the positions of left and right driving cars.
    l_drivers = []
    r_drivers = []
    
    # Calculate the number of collisions when 'n' is odd.
    if n % 2 == 1:
        for i in range(n):
            l_drivers.append(i)
            r_drivers.append(n - 1 - i)

        collisions = 0
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            if l_drivers[i] == r_drivers[i]:
                collisions += 1
            l_drivers[i] += 1
            r_drivers[i] -= 1

        return collisions
    
    # Calculate the number of collisions when 'n' is even.
    else:
        for i in range(n // 2):
            l_drivers.append(i)
            r_drivers.append(n - 1 - i)
        for i in range(n // 2):
            l_drivers.append(n - i - 1);
            r_drivers.append(i)

        collisions = 0
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            if l_drivers[i] == r_drivers[i]:
                collisions += 1
            l_drivers[i] += 1
            r_drivers[i] -= 1

        return collisions

# Test the function with a few inputs and verify the outputs.
test_cases = [
    (2, 0),
    (4, 2),
    (10, 5),
    (100, 50)
]

for n, expected in test_cases:
    assert car_race_collision(n) == expected
```
This script defines the `car_race_collision` function, which takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of cars. It handles whether `n` is odd or even and returns the number of collisions as described in the problem statement. It also includes a list of test cases to validate the function's output against expected values.
