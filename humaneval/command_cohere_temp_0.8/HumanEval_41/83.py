Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the car crash problem as per the provided markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n):
    """
    Determine the number of collisions between two sets of n cars moving in opposite directions.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return 0

    return n * (n - 1) // 2

# Test Cases
def test_car_race_collision():
    assert car_race_collision(0) == 0
    assert car_race_collision(1) == 0
    assert car_race_collision(2) == 1
    assert car_race_collision(5) == 10
    assert car_race_collision(10) == 45

test_car_race_collision()
print("All tests passed!")
```

This script defines the `car_race_collision` function based on the given problem statement and provides a few test cases to validate the correctness of the solution. The `test_car_race_collision` function runs the tests and prints "All tests passed!" upon success. 

Let's break down the solution further:
- The `car_race_collision` function takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of cars in each set. 
- We handle the edge cases where there's either zero or one car in either set (`n <= 1`) and return 0 collisions in such cases.
- For `n` cars in each set, we calculate the number of collisions using the formula `n * (n-1) // 2`, which calculates the pairs of cars that will collide in each set and adds them, avoiding double counting by using the `// 2` operation. 

This formula is the result of considering that, for `n` cars, there are `n` possible cars that can collide with any other car in the set, which leads to a total of `n * (n-1)` possible collisions. However, we need to avoid double-counting the collisions where two cars from the same set collide, leading to the `// 2` operation. 

The tests provided ensure that the function behaves as expected for different values of `n`.
