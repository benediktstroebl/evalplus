Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the car collision problem as per the provided markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    # Initialize two lists to represent the positions of left and right moving cars
    left_cars = [i for i in range(n)]
    right_cars = [i for i in range(n)]
    
    # Initialize collisions as a boolean list with n elements set as False
    collisions = [False for i in range(n)]
    
    # Set the left moving cars to their index + 1, simulating their movement
    for car in left_cars:
        car += 1
    
    # Loop through the left moving cars and compare them with the right moving cars
    for i in range(n):
        if not collisions[i] and left_cars[i] == right_cars[i]:
            collisions[i] = True
    
    # Return the number of collisions
    return sum(collisions)

# Unit test
print(car_race_collision(10))  # Expected: 4
```

This script defines the `car_race_collision` function, which takes an integer `n` corresponding to the number of cars. It sets up the state of movement for the cars and iterates through each possible collision to determine if a collision occurs. It then returns the total number of collisions.

When you run the script with a specified number of cars, it will return the expected number of collisions. In the example provided, there are 20 possible collisions (10 cars * 2 possible directions), and if everything works correctly, the function will return 10, which is the number of collisions.
