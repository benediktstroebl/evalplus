Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the car collision problem described in the markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    # Define 2 lists to store the positions of inward and outward moving cars.
    inward, outward = [0] * n, [0] * n
    
    # Track the number of collisions:
    collisions = 0
    
    # Initialize the position of each car:
    for car_num in range(1, n + 1):
        # Even cars move outward:
        inward[car_num // 2] = -car_num
        
        # Odd cars move inward:
        outward[car_num // 2] = car_num
    
    # Iterate through each car to check for collisions:
    for car_num in range(1, n + 1):
        if inward[car_num] > 0 and outward[car_num] < 0:
            # If an inward moving car finds an empty spot, it moves to that spot:
            inward[car_num] += 1
        elif inward[car_num] < 0 and outward[car_num] > 0:
            # If an outward moving car finds an empty spot, it moves to that spot:
            outward[car_num] += 1
        elif inward[car_num] < 0 and outward[car_num] < 0:
            # If both cars are moving inward or both are moving outward, no collision:
            pass
        else:  # if(inward[car_num] > 0 && outward[car_num] > 0):
            # If a car moving inward hits a car moving outward, mark it as a collision:
            collisions += 1
    
    return collisions
```

This function uses 2 lists (`inward` and `outward`) to keep track of the `n` cars moving from left to right and right to left, respectively. It then iterates through each car, updating its position based on the availability of vacant spots. When both cars are moving in the same direction, it increments the corresponding count for that direction. If an inward-moving car encounters a car moving outward, it is considered a collision, and the `collisions` count is updated accordingly.  The function outputs the total number of collisions detected. 

You can verify the functionality of the function using the test cases provided earlier to verify if the function returns the expected values for various cases.  These cases include collisions between cars as well as scenarios where no collisions occur.  The function is designed to handle the given problem's complexities and provides an efficient solution.  It is highly efficient, and its time complexity is O(n), where `n` is the number of cars involved in the race.  This is because the number of iterations required to settle the position of each car is directly proportional to the number of cars involved.  It does not require any recursive or nested calls, and no new data structures are created during the execution of the function unless a collision is detected, which results in an increment of the `collisions` variable by 1.  In the worst-case scenario when every car collides with another (e.g., n is low enough that every car pairs off in a collision), the runtime is still O(n).  This is because the function's logic is purely iterative, and the list traversals for updating positions and checking for collisions are linear operations.  There are no recursive calls or function calls with multiple nested loops that could lead to a higher time complexity.  This makes the function very efficient and optimized to solve this particular problem.  Here are some examples of calls to this function and the results they should produce:
