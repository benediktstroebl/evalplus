Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the car collision problem as per the provided Markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Determine the number of collisions when two sets of n cars move toward each other on an infinitely long straight road.

    Args:
        n (int): Number of cars in each set.

    Returns:
        int: The number of collisions between the moving cars.
    """
    # Define the two sets of cars as two lists that represent the cars moving from left to right and right to left respectively.
    cars1, cars2 = [], []
    # Initialize trackers for left and right pointers
    i, j = 0, 0
    # Initialize a counter for collisions
    collision_count = 0

    # The two sets of cars are infinitely far away from each other at the beginning.
    distance_between_cars = float('inf')

    while i < n and j < n:
        # Calculate the distance between current cars in the two sets.
        distance = abs(cars1[i].speed - cars2[j].speed)

        # If the distance is less than the remaining distance to the next car in either set, predict a collision.

        else:

Let's break down the code step by step:
1. **Function Definition**: `car_race_collision(n)` takes an integer `n` as an input, which represents the number of cars in each set. The function returns the number of collisions between the cars.
2. **Initialization**: Two empty lists, `cars1` and `cars2`, are initialized to represent the two sets of cars. `i` and `j` are initialized to track the position of the left and right pointers respectively. `collision_count` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of collisions.
3. **Initial Setup**: The initial distance between the two sets of cars is set to infinity, representing that they are infinitely far away from each other at the beginning.
4. ** iterative loop**: While there are remaining cars in both sets (`i < n` and `j < n`), we calculate the distance between the current cars in the two sets and compare it to the remaining distance to the next car in either set. 
5. **Collision Detection**: If the distance between the current cars is less than the remaining
