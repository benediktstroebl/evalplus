Here's a Python script that contains a function which solves the car collision problem as per the provided markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n):
    cars_left = n // 2
    cars_right = n - cars_left
    
    collisions = 0
    
    for i in range(cars_left):
        for j in range(cars_right):
            if i != j:
                collisions += 1
    
    return collisions

# Tests
assert car_race_collision(10) == 5 
assert car_race_collision(100) == 50
```

This function `car_race_collision()` takes in the number of cars `n` as input, and uses two nested loops to iterate through every possible pair of cars, differentiating between cars going left to right and right to left. It then checks if each pair of cars differs in their direction by assigning `collisions` an increment of 1 if the conditions are met. The function returns the total count of collisions.
