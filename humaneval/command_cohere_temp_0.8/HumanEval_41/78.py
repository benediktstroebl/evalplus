Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the car crash problem as per the provided markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    # Initialize two lists to represent the positions of cars moving left to right and right to left.
    left_to_right = [i for i in range(n)]
    right_to_left = [i for i in range(n)]
    
    # Initialize collision variable to track collisions.
    collisions = 0
    
    # Iterate through all combinations of cars from the two lists.
    for i in range(n):
        # For each car moving left to right, check if there's a car moving right to left at the same position.
        if left_to_right[i] == right_to_left[i]:
            # If a match is found, increment the collisions variable.
            collisions += 1
        
        # Since the cars are infinitely sturdy, we can update their positions as if no collision occurred.
        # Move each car in both lists to the next position.
        left_to_right[i] += 1
        right_to_left[i] += 1

    return collisions
```
This function `car_race_collision(n)` takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of cars, and returns the number of collisions between the two sets of cars moving in opposite directions. Each car is represented by its position in the respective list, and the cars are updated as if the collisions never occurred, ensuring that the function accounts for these "indestructible" cars correctly.
