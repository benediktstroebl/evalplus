Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the car crash problem as per the provided markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    # Define 2 lists to store the positions of left and right driving cars.
    left_cars = [i for i in range(n)]
    right_cars = [i for i in range(n)]
    
    # Initialize collisions as 0.
    collisions = 0

    # Move left cars to the right.
    for i in range(n):
        left_cars[i] += 1
        
        # Check for collisions.
        for j in range(n):
            if left_cars[i] == right_cars[j] and left_cars[i] != right_cars[j] - 1:
                collisions += 1
                break
        
        # Update right_cars.
        right_cars[j] += 1
    
    return collisions

# Tests.
print(car_race_collision(1))  # Should output 0.
print(car_race_collision(2))  # Should output 1.
print(car_race_collision(5))  # Should output 2.
```

This script defines the `car_race_collision` function as per the instructions provided in the markdown code block and includes a few tests to validate the function. 

Let's break down the logic:
1. **Defining `left_cars` and `right_cars`:** Two lists, `left_cars` and `right_cars`, are defined to keep track of the positions of the left and right driving cars, respectively.
2. **Initializing Collisions:** The `collisions` counter is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of collisions.
3. **Moving Left Cars Right:** The loop moves each car in the left-driving group by 1 position to the right. After each move, it checks for collisions with the right-driving group. 
4. **Checking for Collisions:** For each move of a left car, the function checks all the right cars to see if a collision has occurred. A collision is determined if the `left_cars[i]` (the current position of the left car) is equal to the `right_cars[j]` (the current position of a right car), but NOT equal to `right_cars[j] - 1` (indicating the right car was already moved once and is now in the left car's previous position).
5. **Updating `right_cars`:** After checking for collisions, the position of the right car is updated by incrementing it by 1.
6. **Returning Collisions:** Finally, the function returns the calculated number of collisions.

This approach considers the movements of individual cars in both directions, ensuring that collisions are accurately detected when the cars overlap in the same position, regardless of which group they belong to.
