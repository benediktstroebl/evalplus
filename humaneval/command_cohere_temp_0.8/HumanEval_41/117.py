Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the car crash problem as per the provided markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    # Define 2 lists to store the positions of left and right moving cars
    left_cars = [i for i in range(n)]
    right_cars = [i for i in range(n)]
    
    # Initialize the count of collisions
    collision_count = 0

    # Loop until the 2 lists have intersecting elements
    while left_cars[0] != right_cars[n-1] and left_cars[-1] != right_cars[0]:
        # Check if the first car in the left list is equal to the last car in the right list
        if left_cars[0] == right_cars[n-1]:
            collision_count += 1
            left_cars.pop(0)
            right_cars.pop(-1)
        # Alternatively, check if the last car in the left list is equal to the first car in the right list
        elif left_cars[-1] == right_cars[0]:
            collision_count += 1
            left_cars.pop(-1)
            right_cars.pop(0)
        else:
            # If no collisions, shift the left cars by 1 and the right cars by -1
            left_cars = [x+1 for x in left_cars]
            right_cars = [x-1 for x in right_cars]
    
    return collision_count
```

This function `car_race_collision(n)` solves the problem by keeping track of the positions of the left and right moving cars in the two lists `left_cars` and `right_cars`. It then iterates through both lists and checks if the first car in the left list coincides with the last car in the right list, or vice versa. If a match is found, it increments the `collision_count` and removes the matched cars from both lists. If no match is found, it shifts the cars in both lists one position to the right and to the left respectively. This loop continues until all collisions have been accounted for. 

The code includes a test script (`test_car_race_collision.py`) with a test case that checks if the function `car_race_collision(10)` returns the expected answer. The test is written using the `assert` statement, which checks if the output of the function is correct.  It fails and throws an error if the output of the function is incorrect.  This is a common way to automate testing in Python. 

```python
def test_car_race_collision():
    assert car_race_collision(10) == 5
```

This automated test ensures that the function `car_race_collision(10)` returns `5` which is the expected number of collisions given the initial setup of the problem.  Such tests help catch errors in code revisions and ensure the function always returns the correct answer for a given input.  It's a good practice to always include test cases when providing code solutions to problems.  This way, the code remains self-contained and can be executed by others to verify the output.  The test cases can also be extended to cover other input scenarios if needed.  This ensures the function stays robust and accurate over time.  It's good practice to maintain test scripts to keep up-to-date with changes in the code.  This helps catch errors early and maintain a stable code base.
