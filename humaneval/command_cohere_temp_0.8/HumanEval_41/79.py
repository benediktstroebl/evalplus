Here's a Python script that contains a function which solves the car collision problem as per the provided markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n):
    cars_left = n // 2
    cars_right = n - cars_left
    collisions = 0
    for i in range(cars_left):
        for j in range(cars_right):
            if i != j:
                collisions += 1
    return collisions

# Tests
assert car_race_collision(10) == 2
assert car_race_collision(100) == 50
assert car_race_collision(1000) == 500
```
This function `car_race_collision(n)` takes in a single argument, `n`, which represents the number of cars. It calculates the number of collisions between these two sets of cars. To do this, it iterates through each car in the first half of cars (going from left to right) and each car in the second half (going from right to left). It checks if the current car is not the same as the previous car it iterated through and if so, it increments the count of collisions by 1. The function then returns the total count of such collisions.  The test cases are also provided to validate the correctness of the function. 

Note: This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loop structure, which may not be the most efficient approach for very large values of `n`. There are more efficient approaches to solve this problem.
