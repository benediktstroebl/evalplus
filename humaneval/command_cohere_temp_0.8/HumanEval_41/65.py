Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the car crash problem as per the provided markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    # Define 2 lists to store the positions of left and right moving cars
    left_cars = [i for i in range(n)]
    right_cars = [i for i in range(n)]
    
    # Initialize collisions counter
    collisions = 0
    
    # Move left cars to the right
    for i in range(n):
        left_cars[i] += 1
        # Check if any left car collided with a right car
        if left_cars[i] == right_cars[i]:
            collisions += 1
        # If not, move the left car but no the right car
        else:
            left_cars[i] -= 1
    
    # Move right cars to the left
    for i in range(n):
        right_cars[i] -= 1
        # Check if any left car collided with a right car
        if left_cars[i] == right_cars[i]:
            collisions += 1
        # If not, move the right car but not the left car
        else:
            right_cars[i] += 1
    
    return collisions

# Tests
def test_car_race_collision():
    assert car_race_collision(1) == 0
    assert car_race_collision(2) == 0
    assert car_race_collision(3) == 0
    assert car_race_collision(4) == 0
    assert car_race_collision(10) == 5
    assert car_race_collision(1000) == 499500
```
This script defines the `car_race_collision` function with input as the number of cars `n`, returns the number of collisions, and incorporates tests to validate the function's behavior for various inputs.  Please note that this solution utilizes 2 lists to store the positions of the left and right moving cars, which is not the most space-efficient approach, but it avoids the need for extra space around collisions.
