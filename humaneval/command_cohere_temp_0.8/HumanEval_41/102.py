Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the car crash problem as per the provided markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    # Initialize two lists to hold the positions of left and right driving cars.
    left_driving = [i for i in range(n)]
    right_driving = [i for i in range(n)]

    # Initialize collision variable to zero.
    collisions = 0

    # Iterate through each pair of cars.
    for i in range(n - 1):
        # If the cars are on the same position, increment the collision variable.
        if left_driving[i] == right_driving[i]:
            collisions += 1
        # Move the right driving car to the right.
        right_driving[i + 1] = right_driving[i] + 1

    # Move the left driving cars to the right.
    for i in range(n - 1):
        left_driving[i + 1] = left_driving[i] + 1

    # Reverse the right_driving list and return the number of collisions.
    return collisions + sum([1 if left_driving[i] == right_driving[i] else 0 for i in range(n)])

# Function to check the correctness of the solution.
def check_solution(n):
    # Initialize the base case.
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    # Initialize two lists to keep track of collisions for the left and right driving cars.
    left_collisions = 0
    right_collisions = 0
    # Call the car_race_collision function and store the returned value.
    collisions = car_race_collision(n)
    # Iterate through the list of left driving cars and check if a collision occurred with the right driving cars.
    for i in range(n):
        # If there was a collision, increment the variable.
        if i == right_driving[i]:
            left_collisions += 1
    # Reverse the list of right driving cars.
    right_driving.reverse()
    # Iterate through the list of right driving cars and check if a collision occurred with the left driving cars.
    for i in range(n):
        # If there was a collision, increment the variable.
        if i == left_driving[i]:
            right_collisions += 1
    # Return the number of collisions given by the function minus the number of left and right driving collisions.
    return collisions - (left_collisions + right_collisions)

# Unit test for the solution.
print(check_solution(10))
```
This script includes the function `car_race_collision` to solve the given problem and a separate function `check_solution` to validate the correctness of the solution against a test case.
