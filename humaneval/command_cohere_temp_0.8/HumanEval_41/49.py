Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the car crash problem as per the provided markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n):
    cars_left = n // 2
    cars_right = n - cars_left
    
    collisions = 0
    
    for i in range(cars_left):
        for j in range(cars_right):
            if i != j:
                collisions += 1
    
    return collisions

# Test cases
assert car_race_collision(5) == 0
assert car_race_collision(7) == 1
assert car_race_collision(10) == 5
```

This script defines the `car_race_collision` function, which takes in the number of cars `n` as input. It calculates the number of collisions between the cars moving from left to right and those moving from right to left. It does so by counting the number of pairings between cars from the two groups that do not overlap. The function returns the number of collisions. 

The test cases are designed to verify the function's correctness across different scenarios. You can modify these tests to assess the function's behavior for other input values.
