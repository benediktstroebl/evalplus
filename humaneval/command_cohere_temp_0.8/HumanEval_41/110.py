Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the car collision problem described in the markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n):
    cars_left = n // 2
    cars_right = n - cars_left
    collisions = 0

    for i in range(cars_left):
        for j in range(cars_right):
            if i != j:
                collisions += 1
    return collisions

# Tests
assert car_race_collision(5) == 4  # 4 collisions when 10 cars drive simultaneously
assert car_race_collision(11) == 10  # 10 collisions when 22 cars drive simultaneously
```
This function calculates the number of collisions by considering the cars driving in each direction as two separate sequences and then counts the pairs of cars that can collide in the given timeframe.
