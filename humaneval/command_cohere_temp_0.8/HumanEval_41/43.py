Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the car collision problem as per the provided Markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n):
    # Define two lists to represent the positions of cars moving left to right and right to left.
    l2r = [i for i in range(n)]
    r2l = [i for i in range(n)]
    
    # Initialize variables to track the number of collisions and the current position of cars.
    collisions = 0
    position = 0
    
    while len(l2r) + len(r2l) > 0:
        # Check if the current position is a collision.
        if l2r[position] == r2l[position]:
            collisions += 1
        
        # Move the left-to-right cars to the right and the right-to-left cars to the left.
        for _ in range(n):
            position += 1
            l2r.pop(0) if position >= len(l2r) else None
            r2l.pop(0) if position >= len(r2l) else None
    
    return collisions

# Test the function with a small input size.
print(car_race_collision(3))  # Expected output: 2
```
This script defines the `car_race_collision` function, which takes an integer `n` representing the number of cars as input. The function uses two lists (`l2r` and `r2l`) to track the positions of cars moving left to right and right to left, respectively. It also maintains a `collisions` variable to count the number of collisions and a `position` variable to keep track of the current position of the cars.

The logic behind the algorithm is to simulate the movement of cars along the straight line. The while loop continues as long as there are still cars to be processed (i.e., the length of `l2r` and `r2l` is greater than 0). During each iteration, the function checks if the current position results in a collision (if the index in both lists is the same). If so, it increments the `collisions` variable.

After checking for collisions, the cars are moved along their respective directions. The `position` variable is incremented by 1, and the cars are removed from the front of the lists if they exceed the index of their list (`pop(0) if position >= len(...) else None`). This effectively moves the cars along their trajectories.

Finally, the function returns the total number of collisions observed during the "race."
