Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the car collision problem described in the markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n):
    # Ensure n is a positive integer
    n = int(n)
    assert n > 0

    # Initialize two lists to represent the positions of cars moving from left to right and right to left
    car_left_to_right = [i for i in range(n)]
    car_right_to_left = [i for i in range(n)]

    # Initialize a variable to track the number of collisions
    collision_count = 0

    # Simulate the movement of cars
    for i in range(n):
        # Determine the next positions of cars in both directions
        car_left_to_right[i] += 1
        car_right_to_left[i] -= 1

        # Check for collisions by comparing the two lists
        collision = any(x > y for x, y in zip(car_left_to_right, car_right_to_left))
        if collision:
            collision_count += 1

    return collision_count
```
This function outputs the number of collisions between cars driving from left to right and those driving from right to left, considering the scenario described in the markdown code block where the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong to withstand collisions without stopping.
