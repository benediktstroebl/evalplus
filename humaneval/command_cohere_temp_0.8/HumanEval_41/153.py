Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the car collision problem as per the provided markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Determine the number of collisions when two sets of n cars move towards each other on an infinitely long straight road.
    """
    # Define the two sets of cars as two lists of n cars each.
    cars_1 = [i for i in range(n)]
    cars_2 = [i for i in range(n, 0, -1)]
    
    # Initialize the collision count to zero.
    collision_count = 0
    
    # Iterate over the two sets of cars and check for collisions.
    for i in cars_1:
        for j in cars_2:
            if i > j:
                collision_count += 1
                break  # Move on to the next iteration of the inner loop.
    
    return collision_count
```

This script defines the function `car_race_collision`, which takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of collisions between the two sets of cars.

The function first defines two lists, `cars_1` and `cars_2`, which represent the two sets of cars moving towards each other. The cars in these lists are represented by numbers, not actual objects nor any kind of car-related attributes. 

Then, to calculate the number of collisions, the function loops through each car in `cars_1` and checks if it collides with any car in `cars_2`. If a collision is detected (i.e., a car in `cars_1` is greater than a car in `cars_2`), the function increments the `collision_count` and breaks out of the inner loop to move on to the next iteration and consider the next pair of cars. 

Finally, the function returns the `collision_count`, which represents the number of collisions between the two sets of cars. 

This solution is relatively straightforward and intuitive, and it should efficiently handle collisions between the cars as per the problem statement.
