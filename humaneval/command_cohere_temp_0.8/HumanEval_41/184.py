Here's a Python script that contains a function which solves the car collision problem as per the provided markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n):
    cars_left = n // 2
    cars_right = n - cars_left
    collisions = 0

    for i in range(cars_left):
        for j in range(cars_right):
            if i == j:
                continue
            elif i + j >= n:
                break
            else:
                collisions += 1
    return collisions

# Tests
assert car_race_collision(6) == 4
assert car_race_collision(10) == 5
assert car_race_collision(3) == 0
```
This code defines the `car_race_collision` function, which takes in the number of cars `n` as input and returns the number of collisions between the two sets of cars.

The approach taken is to iterate through each car in the first half of cars (moving from left to right) and each car in the second half of cars (moving from right to left). If the current car in the first half is equal to the current car in the second half, it skips as they cannot collide. If the current cars are offset by more than one car, it breaks the inner loop as the cars will not collide. Otherwise, it counts a collision for each valid iteration where cars are not skipped.
