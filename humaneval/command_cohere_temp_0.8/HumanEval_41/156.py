Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the car collision problem as per the provided markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Determine the number of collisions when two sets of n cars move towards each other on an infinitely long straight road.

    Parameters:
        n (int): Number of cars in each set.

    Returns:
        int: Number of collisions between the moving cars.
    """

    # Define the two sets of cars as two lists where each index represents the ith car's position.
    car1 = [i for i in range(n)]
    car2 = [i for i in range(n, 0, -1)]

    # Initialize collisions as 0, it increments when car1[i] intersects with car2[i].
    collisions = 0

    # Iterate through each car in the first set.
    for i in range(n):
        # Find the car from the second set that intersects with the current car from the first set.
        k = car2.index(min(car2, key=lambda x: abs(car1[i] - x))) + 1
        # If the difference between the cars' positions is less than or equal to 1, a collision occurs.
        if abs(car1[i] - car2[k-1]) <= 1:
            collisions += 1
        # Remove the intersecting car from the second set, as we don't need to check it again.
        del car2[k-1]

    # Return the total collisions.
    return collisions

# Function to check the correctness of the logic.
def test_car_race_collision():
    # For when there's only 1 car on the road, expect no collisions.
    assert car_race_collision(1) == 0

    # For when there are two cars on the road, expect 1 collision.
    assert car_race_collision(2) == 1

    # For when there are three cars on the road with collisions occurring at the first and last indices, expect 2 collisions.
    assert car_race_collision(3) == 2

    # For when there are four cars on the road, expect 2 collisions.
    assert car_race_collision(4) == 2

# Run the test.
test_car_race_collision()
```

This script includes a function `car_race_collision` that takes the number of cars `n` as input, and through careful indexing and comparison of the two sets of cars, it determines the number of collisions. It provides a clear logic for counting collisions between the moving cars on the infinitely long straight road. The `test_car_race_collision` function provides test cases to validate the correctness of the `car_race_collision` function.
