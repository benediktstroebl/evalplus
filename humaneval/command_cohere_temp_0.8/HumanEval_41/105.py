Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the car collision problem as per the provided description, along with testing functionality:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Determine the number of collisions when two sets of n cars move toward each other on an infinitely long straight road.
    """
    collisions = 0
    
    # Calculate all possible pairs of cars
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            # Calculate the distance moved by each car in one time step
            car1_distance = i * 2
            car2_distance = n - j + 1
            # Count collisions if distances overlap
            if car1_distance <= car2_distance:
                collisions += 1
            elif car2_distance <= car1_distance:
                collisions += 1
    
    return collisions

# Function to parse the test cases from the input
def solve_problems():
    tests = []
    tests.append(('Case 1', 5, 10, 15))
    tests.append(('Case 2', 1, 5, 6))
    tests.append(('Case 3', 2, 7, 7))
    tests.append(('Case 4', 3, 5, 2))
    tests.append(('Case 5', 10, 1, 9))
    for case_name, n1, n2, expected in tests:
        calculated_result = car_race_collision(n1) + car_race_collision(n2) - car_race_collision(n1 + n2)
        if calculated_result == expected:
            print(f"Case '{case_name}' passes: {expected=}")
        else:
            print(f"Case '{case_name}' fails: Expected {expected}, got {calculated_result}.")

# Run the problem solver
solve_problems()
```

This script includes a function `car_race_collision` that calculates the number of collisions. It iterates through all possible pairs of cars and checks if their distances overlap in one step, counting collisions accordingly.

It also includes a function `solve_problems` to parse and solve multiple test cases, comparing the calculated results with expected values and printing pass/fail messages. You can edit the test cases in the `tests` list to match your specific scenarios.

Feel free to add more test cases as needed!
