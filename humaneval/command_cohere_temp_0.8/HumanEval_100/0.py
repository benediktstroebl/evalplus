```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    pile = [n]
    while len(pile) < n+1:
        if n % 2 == 1:
            n += 2
        else:
            n += 1
        pile.append(n)
    return pile
```
This script defines a function `make_a_pile` that takes a single argument `n`, representing the number of stones in the first level of the pile. It aims to generate a list representation of the pile, where each element `pile[i]` represents the number of stones in the `i+1` level. The logic inside the function iteratively constructs this pile by adding odd or even numbers to the previous level, based on whether the previous level's size was odd or even. The process continues until the pile has `n+1` levels.
