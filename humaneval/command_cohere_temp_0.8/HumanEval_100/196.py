```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    # Initialize a list to store the number of stones in each level
    pile = [n]
    
    # Compute the number of stones for the next level depending on the parity of n
    while len(pile) < (len(str(n)) - 1) // 2:
        if n % 2 == 1:
            n += 2
        else:
            n += 1
        pile.append(n)
    
    return pile
```
This code defines a function make_a_pile that takes a positive integer n as input and returns a list representing the number of stones in each level of the pile. It starts with n stones in the first level, and then iteratively calculates the number of stones for the next level based on the parity of n. It alternates between odd and even numbers. The loop continues until the length of the pile list is equal to half the length of the string representation of n, ensuring that the pile contains an equal number of odd and even levels.
