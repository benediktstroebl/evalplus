```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [n]
    else:
        return [n] + [int(n % 2 == 0 and n + 2 or n + 1)] * (n - 2)
```

The Python code defines a function `make_a_pile` that takes a single argument `n`, representing the number of stones needed for each level in the pile. The base case is when `n` is 1, where it returns a list containing only 1, since this is the first level of the pile. For values of `n` greater than 1, the function returns a list containing the first element n, followed by a series of alternating odd and even numbers, representing the number of stones for each subsequent level. The alternating pattern is generated by evaluating `n % 2 == 0 and n + 2` for odd levels and `n + 1` for even levels, resulting in a list that depicts the desired pattern of stone counts for each level.

Here is a example usage of the function:
```python
print(make_a_pile(3))
```

The output of this usage is:
```
[3, 5, 7]
```
