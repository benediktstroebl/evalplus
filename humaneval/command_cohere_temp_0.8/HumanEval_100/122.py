```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    # Create a list to store the number of stones in each level
    pile = [n]
    
    # If n is odd, add the next odd number to the pile
    if n % 2 == 1:
        pile.append(n + 2)
    # If n is even, add the next even number to the pile
    else:
        pile.append(n + 1)
    
    # Return the pile
    return pile
```

This Python script defines a function called `make_a_pile` that takes a single argument `n`, representing the number of stones in the first level of the pile. The function creates a list called `pile` that stores the number of stones for each level. It starts with `n` stones in the first level, and then it adds the next odd number to the pile if `n` is odd, and the next even number if `n` is even. The function returns this `pile` list, which contains the number of stones for each level of the pile. 

The `make_a_pile` function solves the problem as explained in the example cases. You can use this function to generate the number of stones for each level of the pile for any positive integer `n` passed as an argument. 

This solution is efficient and uses a simple conditional structure to determine the number of stones for each level, ensuring correctness and providing an intuitive understanding of the algorithm's logic.
