```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    pile = [n]
    while len(pile) < n + 1:
        if n % 2 == 1:
            n += 2
        else:
            n += 1
        pile.append(n)
    return pile
```
The code defines a function make_a_pile that takes a positive integer n as input and returns a list representing the number of stones in each level of a pile. It starts with n stones on the first level and then iteratively calculates the number of stones for the next level based on whether n is odd or even. The while loop continues until the pile has the required number of levels (n+1). The resulting list, pile, stores the count of stones for each level, and it's returned as the output.
