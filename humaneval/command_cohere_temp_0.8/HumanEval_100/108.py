```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    pile = [n]
    while len(pile) < n + 1:
        if n % 2 == 1:
            n += 2
        else:
            n = n + 1 if n == 0 else n + 3
        pile.append(n)
    return pile
```

The code defines a function make_a_pile that takes a positive integer n as input and returns a list representation of a pile of stones with `n` levels, where each level follows the specified rules. It starts with `n` stones on the first level and then iteratively calculates the number of stones for the next level based on whether `n` is even or odd. The results are accumulated in the `pile` list, and the loop continues until the pile contains `n + 1` levels. The final result is returned as the `pile` list.
