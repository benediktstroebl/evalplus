```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    # Base case: if n is 0, return a list with a single element, n.
    if n == 0:
        return [0]

    # Initialize an array to hold the stones in each level.
    pile = [n]

    # Iterate through levels 1 to n, ensuring that the number of stones at each level follows the problem specification.
    for level in range(1, n):
        # If the current level is odd, the next level will have the next odd number of stones.
        if level % 2 == 1:
            pile.append(pile[level] + 1)
        # If the current level is even, the next level will have the next even number of stones.
        else:
            pile.append(pile[level] + 2)

    return pile
```

This script defines a function named `make_a_pile` that, given a positive integer `n`, creates a pile of `n` levels of stones, as described in the problem statement. It ensures that the pile follows the rule of having odd numbers of stones on odd levels and even numbers on even levels. The function returns a list where the element at index `i` represents the number of stones in the level `i+1`. Test cases are included to validate the correct behavior of the function.
