```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    pile = [n]
    while len(pile) < n+1:
        if len(pile) % 2 == 0 and pile[-1] % 2 == 0:
            pile.append(pile[-1] + 2)
        elif len(pile) % 2 == 1 or pile[-1] % 2 == 1:
            pile.append(pile[-1] + 1)
        else:
            raise Exception("Something went wrong")
    return pile
```
The provided Python code defines a function called make_a_pile that takes a single argument, n, representing the number of stones needed for each level in the pile. The function starts by creating a list called pile with the first level's stones (n). It then enters a loop that continues until the length of the pile reaches n+1, indicating that all levels have been generated. Within the loop, the code checks whether the length of the pile is odd or even and whether the last element in the pile is odd or even, using the expressions len(pile) % 2 and pile[-1] % 2, respectively. Based on these conditions, it decides whether the next level should have one more or two more stones than the previous level. If both conditions fail (that is, the length is neither odd nor even, or the last element is neither odd nor even), an exception is raised, indicating an error. Otherwise, it increments the previous level's count by 1 or 2, and this new value is added to the pile list. Finally, when the loop completes, the function returns the pile list, which now contains the number of stones required for each level of the pile, starting from the bottom (index 0) and going up to the top.
