```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    # Base case: if n is 0, return a list with a single 0
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    
    # Initial list with n amount of stones
    pile = [n]
    
    # odd and even bases for the next levels
    odd, even = n % 2, n // 2
    
    # Loop for the next levels
    for _ in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        # if the level is odd, add the next odd number of stones
        if _ % 2 == 1:
            pile.append(odd)
            odd += 2
        # if the level is even, add the next even number of stones
        else:
            pile.append(even)
            even += 2
    
    return pile
```

This Python script defines a function called `make_a_pile` that takes a single argument `n`, representing the number of stones in the first level of the pile. The function returns a list where each element represents the number of stones in the corresponding level of the pile.

The script demonstrates an elegant recursive solution, where the base case handles the simplest scenario of a single level with 0 stones. The recursive part creatively uses odd and even variables to determine the count of stones for the next levels, considering the parity of the current level. This solution efficiently solves the problem in a concise manner.
