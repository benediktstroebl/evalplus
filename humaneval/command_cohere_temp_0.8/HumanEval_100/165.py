```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    # Initialize a list to store the number of stones per level
    pile = [n]
    
    # Compute the number of stones for the next level if n is even
    while n % 2 == 0:
        n = n // 2
        pile.append(n)
    
    # Compute the number of stones for the next level if n is odd
    while n % 2 != 0:
        n = (n + 1) // 2
        pile.append(n)
    
    return pile
```

The code utilizes a loop to construct a list `pile` that represents the number of stones required for each level, based on the given integer `n`. It initially sets `pile[0]` to `n` and then enters a loop that processes the even levels. Within this loop, the code divides `n` by 2 to determine the number of stones for the subsequent even level and appends this value to `pile`. Subsequently, it enters a similar loop for odd levels, incrementing `n` by 1 and dividing by 2 to find the corresponding stone count. The outcome is a list `pile` that provides the number of stones required for each level of the pile, where `pile[i]` represents the number of stones in the (i+1)th level.
