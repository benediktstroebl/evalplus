```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    pile = [n]
    while len(pile) < n+1:
        if n % 2 == 1:
            n += 2
        else:
            n += 1
        pile.append(n)
    return pile
```
This script defines a function `make_a_pile` that takes a single argument `n`, representing the number of stones in the first level of the pile. It aims to generate a list representation of the next `n+1` levels of the pile, where each element represents the number of stones in the corresponding level. The logic for determining the number of stones in the next level is consistent with the problem statement: If the current level is odd, it adds the next odd number, and if the current level is even, it adds the next even number. The while loop iterates until the pile size is sufficient for the next `n+1` levels. The final generated list is then returned as the number of stones in each level. 

The provided example usage, `make_a_pile(3)`, outputs `[3, 5, 7]`, which aligns with the expected output for the given input.
