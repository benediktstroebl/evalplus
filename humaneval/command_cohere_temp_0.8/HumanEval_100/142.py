```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    pile = [n]
    while len(pile) < n+1:
        if n % 2 == 1:
            n += 2
        else:
            n += 1
        pile.append(n)
    return pile
```
This function uses a simple iterative approach to create the pile, ensuring the pile's length is correct. The while loop increments the value of n and adds it to the pile if it's currently odd or the next even number if it's even. The condition len(pile) < n+1 ensures that the loop runs until the pile has the required number of levels. Make sure to define the test cases in the same way as in the example so that the function's behavior matches the problem's explanation. Test cases are also essential to ensure the function works correctly for different values of n.  If you need help adding tests, let me know, and I'll be glad to assist!
