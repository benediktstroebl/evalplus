```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    # Initialize a list to store the number of stones per level
    pile = [n]
    
    # Loop to create additional levels according to the problem specification
    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        if i % 2 == 1:  # If the level index is odd
            pile.append(i * 3 - 1)  # Add the next odd number
        else:
            pile.append(i * 2)  # Add the next even number
    
    return pile
```

The code defines a Python function called `make_a_pile` that takes a single argument `n`, representing the number of stones in the first level of the pile. Inside the function, it initializes an empty list called `pile` to store the number of stones per level, and the first element added to this list is the initial number of stones `n`.

The function then enters a loop that iterates from the second level (`i = 1`) up to half the maximum number of levels (`n // 2 + 1`), handling each level differently depending on whether the index `i` is odd or even. 

If the level index is odd, the code calculates the next odd number by multiplying `i` by 3 and subtracting 1 and adds that to the `pile`. If the level index is even, it adds the next even number (which is `i * 2`) to the `pile`.

After the loop completes, the function returns the `pile` list, which represents the number of stones in each level of the pile, with the element at index `i` indicating the number of stones in the `(i+1)`th level.

The unit tests for this function are not included in the response but are still present in the provided script and can be executed by running the script in a Python environment.
