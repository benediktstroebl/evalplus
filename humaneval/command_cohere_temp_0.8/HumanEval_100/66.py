```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    # Initialize a list to store the pile sizes
    pile = [n]

    # Loop to create additional pile levels
    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        pile.append(2 * i - 1 if i % 2 else 2 * i)

    return pile
```

This Python script defines a function named `make_a_pile` that tackles the problem statement. The function takes a single argument, `n`, representing the number of stones in the first level of the pile. Within the function, an initializes a list, `pile`, to store the desired number of stones in each level. Subsequently, a loop iterates through levels, starting from the second level, where it calculates the number of stones in the current level based on whether the previous level was odd or even. The result is appended to the `pile` list. Eventually, the function returns this list, expressing the required number of stones in each level of the pile.
