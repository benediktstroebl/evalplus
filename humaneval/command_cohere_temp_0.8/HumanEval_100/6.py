```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    # Initialize a list to store the pile size at each level
    pile = [n]

    # Loop to build the pile incrementally
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i % 2 == 1:
            pile.append(i + 2)
        else:
            pile.append(i + 1)

    return pile
```

The code defines a function named `make_a_pile` that takes a single argument `n`, representing the number of stones needed at the base of the pile. The function returns a list that depicts the number of stones required for each level of the pile. To achieve this, the function first creates a base pile of `n` stones and then iterates through the odd numbers by adding 2, and even numbers by adding 1, to determine the number of stones needed for the next level. Each newly calculated number is appended to the pile list.
