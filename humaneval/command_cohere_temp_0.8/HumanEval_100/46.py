```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    # Initialize a list to store the pile size at each level
    pile = [n]
    
    # Loop to construct the pile for each level
    for i in range(1, n):
        # If the current level is odd, the next level has the next odd number of stones
        if i % 2 == 1:
            pile.append(i + 3)
        # If the current level is even, the next level has the next even number of stones
        else:
            pile.append(i + 2)
    
    return pile
```

This Python script defines a function `make_a_pile` that takes a single argument `n`, representing the number of stones in the first level of the pile. The function returns a list where the first element is the number of stones in the first level (`n`), and the subsequent elements represent the number of stones in each subsequent level. The logic within the function ensures that the number of stones in each level is the next odd or even number depending on whether the previous level was odd or even, respectively. Thus, the code effectively solves the problem and generates the desired list of stone counts for each level.
