```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    # Initialize a list to store the pile size at each level
    pile = [n]
    
    # Loop to create additional pile levels
    for i in range(1, n.bit_length() + 1):
        # If the current level is odd, take the next odd number
        if i % 2 == 1:
            pile.append(next_odd(pile[i - 1]))
        # If the current level is even, take the next even number
        else:
            pile.append(next_even(pile[i - 1]))
    
    return pile

# Function to find the next odd number after a given number
def next_odd(n):
    return n + 2

# Function to find the next even number after a given number
def next_even(n):
    return n + 1
```

This code defines the `make_a_pile` function, which takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns a list representing the number of stones in each level of the pile. It starts with `n` stones in the first level and then iteratively calculates the number of stones for the next level based on whether the current level is odd or even.

The code then utilizes the `next_odd` and `next_even` functions to determine the next odd or even number based on the previous level's count. These functions simply add 2 to the given number to obtain the next odd number, or add 1 to the given number to obtain the next even number.
