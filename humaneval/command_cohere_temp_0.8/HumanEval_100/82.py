```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [n]
    else:
        return [n] + list(make_a_pile(n + 2))
```

This function uses a recursive approach to solve the problem. At the base case, when `n` is 1, it returns a list containing just 1, since the first level of the pile will have only 1 stone. For larger values of `n`, it uses recursion with the next odd or even number, depending on whether `n` is odd or even, and maintains the list structure by concatenating the result with the result of the next call. Note that this solution explicitly creates a list for a single element (`[n]`), which could potentially waste memory, especially for a large number of calls with large values of `n`. However, this is the simplest and most straightforward solution, and creates a proper list structure for the pile of stones as requested in the prompt.
