```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    # Initialize a list to store the number of stones in each level
    pile = [n]
    
    # Loop to create additional levels according to the problem statement
    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        if i % 2 == 1:  # If the loop index is odd
            pile.append(i * 3 - 1)  # Add the next odd number
        else:
            pile.append(i * 2)  # Add the next even number
    
    return pile
```

The code defines a function `make_a_pile` that takes a single argument `n`, representing the number of stones in the first level of the pile. The function creates a list (`pile`) where each element represents the number of stones in a respective level of the pile. It starts with `n` stones in the first level, then odd levels have `n + 1`, `n + 3`, and so on, while even levels have `n + 2`, `n + 4`, and so on. The recursive nature of the pile's construction aligns with the problem's intent, although it's not explicit in the problem statement.
