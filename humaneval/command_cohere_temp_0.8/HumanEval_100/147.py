```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    pile = [n]
    while len(pile) < n+1:
        if len(pile) % 2 == 0:
            pile.append(pile[-1] + 2)
        else:
            pile.append(pile[-1] + 1)
    return pile
```
This code defines a function `make_a_pile` that takes a single argument `n`, representing the number of stones in the first level of the pile. It uses a list `pile` to keep track of the number of stones in each level and initializes it with `n`. Then, it enters a while loop that continues until the length of the `pile` reaches `n+1`. 

Within the loop, it checks whether the length of the `pile` is even or odd to determine whether the next level should have the next odd or even number of stones. It then updates the `pile` to include this number. Finally, the function returns the `pile`, which represents the number of stones in each level of the pile. 

The code efficiently creates the required pile of stones, as demonstrated by the example usage provided in the initial problem statement.
