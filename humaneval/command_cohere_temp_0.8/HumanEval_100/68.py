```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    pile = [n]
    while len(pile) < n+1:
        if n % 2 == 1:
            n += 2
        else:
            n += 1
        pile.append(n)
    return pile
```
This function uses a simple loop to create the pile, adding the next even number to the pile when the number at the top of the pile is even, and the next odd number when the top number is odd. The loop continues until the pile has reached the desired size. 

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```python
print(make_a_pile(2))  # Outputs: [2, 4, 6]
```
This result can be verified with the problem statement's test case.
