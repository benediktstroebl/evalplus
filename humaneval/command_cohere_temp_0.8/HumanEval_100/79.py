```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    # Calculate the pile size
    pile_size = [n]
    while len(pile_size) < n:
        if len(pile_size) % 2 == 0:
            pile_size.append(pile_size[-1] + 2)
        else:
            pile_size.append(pile_size[-1] + 1)
    return pile_size
```

This function uses a simple iterative approach to calculate the size of each layer in the pile, it starts with a foundation of `n` stones and adds either 1 or 2 stones at each level depending on whether the previous layer was odd or even, respectively. The loop continues until the number of layers reaches `n`, at which point the `pile_size` list is returned. The `while` loop follows the specification and uses the 'dictionary' multiplication operator for efficient append operations.

Here's how the code works in steps:
1.  The foundation of the pile is `n`, so the first element of `pile_size` is `n`.
2.  The code checks if the number of layers `len(pile_size)` is less than `n`, meaning we need to keep building the pile.
3.  In each iteration, the code checks whether the previous layer was an odd or even number to determine the quantity of stones to add.
4.  If the length of `pile_size` is even, it means the previous layer was even, and so it adds 2 stones.
5.  If the length of `pile_size` is odd, it means the previous layer was odd, and so it adds 1 stone.
6.  This process continues until the number of layers reaches `n`.
7.  Once `n` layers are built, the `pile_size` list is returned.

You can verify the functionality of the code by calling the function with different values of `n` and comparing the returned list with the expected sequence of numbers.
