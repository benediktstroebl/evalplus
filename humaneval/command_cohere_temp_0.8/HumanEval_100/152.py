```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    pile = [n]
    while len(pile) < n + 1:
        if len(pile) % 2 == 0:
            pile.append(pile[-1] + 2)
        else:
            pile.append(pile[-1] + 1)
    return pile
```
This Python script defines a function called `make_a_pile` that takes a single argument `n`, representing the number of stones in the first level of the pile. The function initiates a list called `pile` with the first level's stone count (`n`) and then enters a while loop that continues until the length of the `pile` reaches `n + 1`. Within each iteration, it checks whether the length of the `pile` is even or odd to determine the number of stones for the next level accordingly. If the length is even, it appends the next integer to the `pile`, which is the current length increased by 2. If the length is odd, it appends the next integer to the `pile`, which is the current length increased by 1. This process continues until the `pile` has `n + 1` elements.

Here is an example of using the provided function:
```python
>>> make_a_pile(3)
[3, 5, 7]
>>> make_a_pile(4)
[4, 6, 8]
```
This demonstrates the returned list representing the number of stones in each level of the pile, where the element at index `i` corresponds to the number of stones in the `i+1` level.
