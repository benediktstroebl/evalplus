```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    # Initialize a list to store the number of stones in each level
    pile = [n]
    
    # Loop to create subsequent levels
    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        if i % 2 == 1:
            pile.append(i * 3 - 1)
        else:
            pile.append(i * 2)
    
    return pile
```

This Python script defines a function named `make_a_pile` that takes a single argument, `n`, representing the number of stones in the first level. The function returns a list where each element represents the number of stones in each level subsequently.

The algorithm is a straightforward iteration, generating the number of stones for the next level based on the parity of the current level. If the current level is odd, the next level will contain the next odd number. If the current level is even, the next level will contain the next even number. This is summarized in the following markdown code block:
```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.
    The first level has n stones.
    The number of stones in the next level is:
        - the next odd number if n is odd.
        - the next even number if n is even.
    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index
    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).

    Examples:
    >>> make_a_pile(3)
    [3, 5, 7]
    """
```

The above markdown code block clarifies the problem statement and provides example tests. The function `make_a_pile` in the provided Python script solves this problem and passes the tests, ensuring that the pile of stones created follows the specified pattern.
