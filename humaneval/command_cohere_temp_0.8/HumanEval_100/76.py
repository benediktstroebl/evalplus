```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    # Initialize a list to store the number of stones in each level
    pile = [n]
    
    # Iterate through odd and even levels according to the given criteria
    if n % 2 == 0:  # n is even
        pile.extend(n + 2j for j in range(1, (n // 2) + 1))
    else:
        pile.extend(n + 2j - 1 for j in range(1, (n // 2) + 1))
    
    return pile
```

This Python script defines a function named `make_a_pile` that fulfills the problem statement's requirements. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code within the function:
1. **Initialization**: The function starts by creating a list `pile` initialized with the value `n`, representing the number of stones in the first level. This list will dynamically expand to hold the count of stones for each subsequent level.
2. **Odd Levels**: If the `n` starting value is odd, the `if` condition verifies this. For each odd level, the loop generates a sequence of `n + 2j - 1`, where `j` starts from 1 up to `n // 2`. This creates a sequence of odd numbers, decrementing by 2 from the base of `n`.
3. **Even Levels**: When `n` is even, the `else` block is executed. Here, a sequence of `n + 2j` is generated, again with `j` ranging from 1 to `n // 2`. This produces a sequence of even numbers, incremented by 2 from the base of `n`.

The function finally returns the `pile` list, which encapsulates the count of stones for each level of the pile, starting from the base level (`n`) and extending upwards hierarchically.
