```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    piles = []
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            piles.append(i + 2)
        else:
            piles.append(i + 1)
    return piles
```

The code defines a Python function called `make_a_pile` that takes a single argument `n`, representing the number of stones needed for each level in the pile. It returns a list where each element represents the number of stones for the corresponding level. The logic behind the code is straightforward; it iterates through numbers from `1` to `n` (inclusive) and assigns the next even number after an odd number, and vice versa. This creates the desired pattern where odd levels have odd stone counts, and even levels have even counts. The result is a list that represents the number of stones for each level in the pile, according to the problem's specification.
