```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    pile = [n]
    while len(pile) < n + 1:
        if len(pile) % 2 == 0:
            pile.append(pile[-1] + 2)
        else:
            pile.append(pile[-1] + 1)
    return pile
```
The code defines a function make_a_pile that takes a positive integer n as input, representing the number of stones in the first level of the pile. It uses a while loop to build the pile by adding stones to each level based on the following rules:
If the current level has an odd number of stones (len(pile) % 2 == 0 is False), the next level will have one more stone than the current level (e.g., 5, 7, 9, ...).

If the current level has an even number of stones (len(pile) % 2 == 0 is True), the next level will have twice as many stones as the current level (e.g., 4, 8, 12, ...).

This process continues until the number of levels reaches n + 1, ensuring that the final list contains n + 1 elements. The function returns the pile as a list.
