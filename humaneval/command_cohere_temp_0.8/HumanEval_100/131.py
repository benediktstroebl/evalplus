```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [n]
    else:
        return [n] + [int((n % 2) + 1) if n % 2 else n + 2 for n in range(1, n)]
```

This function adheres to the problem statement, creating a pile of stones with the specified pattern of odd and even numbers. It handles the base case when `n` is 1, and if `n` is greater than 1, it returns a list with the first element as `n` and the remaining elements being the progressively calculated stone counts for each level. 

To better understand the formula int((n % 2) + 1) if n % 2 else n + 2), consider its components:
- `n % 2` checks if `n` is odd or even
- If `n` is odd, int((n % 2) + 1) evaluates to int(1) which is 1
- If `n` is even, int((n % 2) + 1) evaluates to int(0) which is 0
- If the result from above is 1, the consequent expression is int(1) + 2 which is 3
- If the result from above is 0, the consequent expression is int(0) + 2 which is 2

Hence, the function correctly generates the required pattern of stone counts for the pile. 

This solution is efficient and can solve the problem for any positive integer `n` within a reasonable time frame.
