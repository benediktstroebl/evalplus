```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    if n == 0:
        return []
    return [n] + make_a_pile(n - 2) if n % 2 == 0 else [n] + make_a_pile(n - 1)
```

The solution works by recursively building up the pile of stones. The base case is when n equals 0, in which case a pile of zero stones is represented as an empty list. For the recursive cases, the formula `(n - 2)` or `(n - 1)` is used to calculate the number of stones in the next level based on whether `n` is even or odd, respectively. The recursion continues until the base case is reached, and the current level's stones are appended to the list representation of the pile. The process mimics the problem's explanation, where the next level's stone count is derived by subtracting 2 from the current odd level's count or subtracting 1 from the current even level's count.
