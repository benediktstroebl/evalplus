```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    pile = [n]
    while len(pile) < n + 1:
        if len(pile) % 2 == 0:
            pile.append(pile[-1] + 2)
        else:
            pile.append(pile[-1] + 1)
    return pile
```
This code defines a function `make_a_pile` that takes a single argument `n`, representing the number of stones in the first level of the pile. It uses a list `pile` to keep track of the number of stones in each level and initially populates it with `n`. It then enters a loop that continues until the length of the `pile` reaches `n + 1`. Within the loop, it checks whether the length of the `pile` is even or odd, and accordingly, it calculates the next level's stone count. If the length is even, it adds 2 to the previous level's stone count. If the length is odd, it adds 1 to the previous level's stone count. Finally, it returns the `pile` list, which now contains the number of stones for each level of the pile, with the element at index `i` representing the number of stones in the level `i + 1`.

Here's an example of using the function with `n = 3`:
```python
>>> make_a_pile(3)
[3, 5, 7]
```
The output corresponds to the number of stones at levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
