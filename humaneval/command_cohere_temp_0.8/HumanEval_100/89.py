```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    pile = [n]
    while len(pile) < n + 1:
        if len(pile) % 2 == 0 and pile[-1] % 2 == 0:
            pile.append(pile[-1] + 2)
        else:
            pile.append(pile[-1] + 1)
    return pile
```

This code defines a function `make_a_pile` that takes a single argument `n`, representing the number of stones in the first level of the pile. It constructs a list `pile` where each element represents the number of stones in a respective level of the pile. The algorithm iteratively adds to this list until it reaches the desired number of levels (`n + 1`).

In each iteration, it checks whether the last element in `pile` is even and the length of the `pile` itself is even, in which case it adds 2 to the last element. Otherwise, it adds 1 to the last element. This is done until `pile` has `n + 1` elements, ensuring that the pile has `n+1` levels with the correct number of stones in each level.
