```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [n]
    else:
        return [n] + odd_even(n + 1)

def odd_even(num):
    odd_sequence = [x for x in range(1, num, 2)]
    even_sequence = [x for x in range(2, num, 2)]
    return odd_sequence if num % 2 else even_sequence
```

This code defines two main functions:
1. The `make_a_pile` function takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns a list representing the stones in each level of the pile. If `n` is 1, it returns a list containing just `n` (the first level), assuming there is only one stone in the pile. Otherwise, it returns a list with `n` followed by the stones in the next level, which is determined by the `odd_even` function.
2. The `odd_even` function is a helper function that determines the number of stones in the next level based on whether `num` is odd or even. It uses list comprehensions to generate the sequence of stones, alternating between odd and even numbers, and returns the appropriate sequence based on the parity of `num`.

Overall, this code solves the problem of constructing a pile of stones with increasing levels, ensuring that the number of stones in each level is the next odd or even number depending on the parity of the previous level.
