```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    pile = [n]
    while len(pile) < n + 1:
        if len(pile) % 2 == 0 and pile[-1] % 2 == 0:
            pile.append(pile[-1] + 2)
        else:
            pile.append(pile[-1] + 1)
    return pile
```
The provided Python script defines a function called `make_a_pile` that takes a single argument `n`, representing the number of stones needed for each level in the pile. The function starts with a foundation of `n` stones for the first level and then iteratively constructs subsequent levels. It follows a recursive algorithm that adds either 2 or 1 stone to the previous level, based on whether the previous level was divisible by 2 and had an even number of stones, concluding with a remainder of 2. The resulting number of stones for each level is stored in a list called `pile`. The function continues to add stones incrementally until the `pile` contains enough stones for `n+1` levels, ensuring that the pile is complete. The final list, `pile`, contains the number of stones required for each level of the pile, with the element at index `i` representing the number of stones in the level at index `i+1`.
