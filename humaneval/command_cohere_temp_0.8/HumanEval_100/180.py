```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    # Initialize a list to store the number of stones per level
    pile = [n]

    # Loop to create subsequent levels
    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        if i % 2 == 1:
            pile.append(i * 3 - 1)
        else:
            pile.append(i * 2)

    # Return the pile of stones
    return pile
```

This Python script defines a function, `make_a_pile(n)`, that takes a positive integer command and creates a list of stone counts for each level of a pile. The first level has n stones. Subsequently, odd levels have stone counts of the next odd number, and even levels have stone counts of the next even number. The function creates this list for `n` levels, returning the pile's stone count progression. 

The example usage, `make_a_pile(3)`, returns `[3, 5, 7]`, indicating 3 stones in the first level, 5 in the second, and 7 in the third. 

The unit tests, `TestMakeAPile.test_make_a_pile()`, verify that the function behaves as expected for various input values, both positive and edge cases. The tests assert that the returned list matches the expected stone counts for each level.
