```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    # Determine the number of stones in the first level
    stones_first_level = n
    
    # Create a list to store the number of stones in each level
    pile = [stones_first_level]
    
    # Iterate through levels 2 through n+1
    for l in range(2, n + 2):
        # If the current level is odd, use the next odd number
        if l % 2 == 1:
            pile.append(l + 1)
        # If the current level is even, use the next even number
        else:
            pile.append(l + 2)
    
    return pile
```
This Python script defines a function called `make_a_pile` that takes a single argument, `n`, assumed to be a positive integer. The task is to create a pile of `n` levels of stones, where the number of stones in each level is defined by the rule that the next level has a number of stones equal to the next odd number if the current level has an odd number of stones, and equal to the next even number if the current level has an even number of stones. The function returns a list where the element at index `i` represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).

The solution creates the list `pile` to store the number of stones in each level, starting with the number of stones in the first level (`n`). It then iterates through levels 2 through `n`+1, determining whether the current level is odd or even, and accordingly, increments the next level's stone count by 1 or 2, respectively. The resulting list `pile` holds the number of stones for each level, and this list is returned.
