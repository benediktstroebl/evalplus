```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    pile = [n]
    while len(pile) < n + 1:
        if n % 2 == 1:
            n += 2
        else:
            n += 1
        pile.append(n)
    return pile
```
This Python script defines a function named `make_a_pile` that takes a single argument `n`, representing the number of stones needed at the first level of the pile. The function returns a list where each element represents the number of stones required for the corresponding level of the pile. It starts with `n` stones at level 1 and increments the count at each even or odd-numbered level, creating a growing pile structure. 

The core logic involves a `while` loop that iterates until the pile's length reaches `n + 1`. Within the loop, it checks whether `n` is odd or even to determine the next stone count and appends this value to the pile. This process continues until the desired number of levels is achieved.
