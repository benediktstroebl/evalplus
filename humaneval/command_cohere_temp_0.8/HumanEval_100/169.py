```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    # Initialize a list to store the number of stones in each level
    pile = [n]
    
    # Loop through and calculate the number of stones for each subsequent level
    while len(pile) < (n + 1):
        if pile[-1] % 2 == 1:  # if current level has an odd number of stones
            pile.append(pile[-1] + 2)
        else:
            pile.append(pile[-1] + 1)
    
    return pile
```

This approach uses a simple while loop that iteratively adds stones to each level based on the given rule. The loop continues until the number of levels (`len(pile)`)) reaches the desired value (`n + 1`). At the end, it returns the pile as a list.

You can test this code by calling `make_a_pile()` with different input values, such as `make_a_pile(3)`, which should return `[3, 5, 7]`.
