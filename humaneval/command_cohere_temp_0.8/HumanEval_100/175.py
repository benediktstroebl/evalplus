```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    # Initialize a list to store the number of stones in each level
    pile = [n]
    
    # Append odd numbers to the list if n is odd, and even numbers if n is even
    if n % 2 == 0:
        pile.extend(x for x in range(n + 2, 0, -2))
    else:
        pile.extend(x for x in range(n + 1, 1, -1))
    
    return pile
```

This script defines a function named `make_a_pile` that takes a single argument `n`, representing the number of stones in the first level of the pile. The function compiles a list `pile` that contains the number of stones for each level of the pile.

If `n` is even, it appends the even numbers `n + 2`, `n + 4`, `n + 6`, ..., to `pile`. If `n` is odd, it appends the odd numbers `n + 1`, `n + 3`, `n + 5`, ..., to `pile`. This creates a pile of stones with the required structure, where the number of stones in each level is the next even or odd number after `n`, depending on the parity of `n`.

The example provided in the problem description would generate the output `[3, 5, 7]`.
