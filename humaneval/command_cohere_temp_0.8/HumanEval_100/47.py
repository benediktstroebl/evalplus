```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    # Calculate the first two levels directly
    pile = [n, ]
    if n % 2 == 1:
        pile.append(n + 2)
    else:
        pile.append(n + 1)
    # Use the explicit formula to generate the remaining levels
    for _ in range(len(pile), n):
        pile.append(pile[-1] + 2**(len(pile) - 1))
    return pile
```

The algorithm for this solution is based on the following logic:
1. We determine the first two layers' values to get started. The first layer has `n` stones, and the second layer will have `n + 2` stones if `n` is odd, and `n + 1` stones if `n` is even.
2. We can use a loop to calculate the number of stones in the subsequent levels after we have the first two levels. Each iteration of the loop adds two levels to the pile, since each level is constructed by taking two stones from the previous level.
3. The loop continues until we have constructed a pile of `n` levels.

This solution creates a pile of `n` levels and returns a list of stone counts for each level.
