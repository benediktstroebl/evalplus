```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    # Get the next odd or even number based on the input being odd or even
    def get_next_number(input_num):
        return (input_num + 1) if input_num % 2 else (input_num + 2)
    
    # Generate the pile of stones
    pile = [n]
    while len(pile) < n + 1:
        pile.append(get_next_number(len(pile) % 2))
    
    return pile
```

This code defines a function `make_a_pile` that takes a single argument `n`, representing the number of stones in the first level of the pile. The function generates a list of stones for each level, starting with `n` stones in the first level, then alternating between odd and even numbers for each subsequent level. The result is a list of stones for each level, where the index `i` of the list represents the number of stones in the level `i+1`.

The code uses a helper function, `get_next_number`, to determine the number of stones for each subsequent level based on the parity of the level index. This way, the code can handle increasingly large values of `n`, ensuring the pile is correctly constructed.
