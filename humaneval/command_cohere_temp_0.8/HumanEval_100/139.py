```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    pile = [n]
    while len(pile) < n + 1:
        if n % 2 == 1:
            n += 2
        else:
            n += 1
        pile.append(n)
    return pile
```
This function starts with a foundation of stones in the first level `n`, then iteratively adds stones to each subsequent level, updating the count of stones (`n`) as it goes, based on the parity of `n`. The loop continues until there's a pile of `n+1` levels, and returns the list of stone counts for each level.  This approach efficiently creates the required pile layout, where the number of stones in the next level is alternated between odd and even to ensure a stable pile.
