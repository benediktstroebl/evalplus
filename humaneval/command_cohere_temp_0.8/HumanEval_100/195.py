```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    pile = [n]
    while len(pile) < n+1:
        if len(pile) % 2 == 1:
            pile.append(pile[-1] + 2)
        else:
            pile.append(pile[-1] + 1)
    return pile
```
This code defines a function `make_a_pile` that takes a single argument `n`, representing the number of stones in the first level of the pile. It uses a list `pile` to keep track of the number of stones in each level and initializes it with `n`. Then, it enters a loop that continues until the length of the `pile` reaches `n+1`. Within the loop, it checks whether the length of the `pile` is odd or even using the modulo operator (`%`). If the length is odd, it increments the previous element by 2 and adds it to the `pile`. If the length is even, it increments the previous element by 1 and adds it to the `pile`. Finally, the function returns the `pile`, which now contains the number of stones for each level of the pile.
