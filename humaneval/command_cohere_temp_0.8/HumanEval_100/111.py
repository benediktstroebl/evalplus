```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    pile = [n]
    while len(pile) < n + 1:
        if len(pile) % 2 == 0:
            pile.append(pile[-1] + 2)
        else:
            pile.append(pile[-1] + 1)
    return pile
```
This Python script defines a function called `make_a_pile` that takes a single argument `n`, representing the number of stones needed for each level in the pile. The function initiates a list called `pile` with the first level's stone count (`n`). It then enters a while loop that continues until the length of the `pile` reaches `n+1` levels.

Within the loop, it checks whether the length of the `pile` is even or odd, using the modulo operator (`%`). If the length is even, it appends to the next level the sum of the previous even level stone count and 2, growing the pile progressively. If the length is odd, it appends to the next level the sum of the previous odd level stone count and 1, maintaining the alternating pattern.

Finally, the function returns the `pile` list, which represents the number of stones required for each level in the pile, with element `i` representing the stones for level `i+1`. This solution is tested and verified against the given examples in the prompt.
