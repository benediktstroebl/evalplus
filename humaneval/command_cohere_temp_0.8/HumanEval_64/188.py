This script defines the `vowels_count` function, which takes a string representing a word as input and returns the number of vowels in the string, according to the problem statement. The script includes the requested test cases and additional test cases to ensure correctness. 
To count the vowels in the string `s`, the `vowels_count` function iterates through each character in the input. It verifies if the character is a vowel, counting it if it is. Additionally, the function accounts for the special case of the letter `y` being a vowel only when it appears alone as the last character in the word. 

The output of the above script is:
```
3
1
2
1
```

Note that the last two examples illustrate the special case of counting the vowel 'y' at the end of the word.
