    This function counts the number of vowels in a given string.
    Specifically, it counts 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', and 'y' as vowels,
    but only when 'y' is at the end of the word.

    Parameters:
    s (str): The input string to count vowels in.

    Returns:
    int: The number of vowels in the string.

            count += 1

            count += 1

# Add more test cases to cover different scenarios

    else:
        print(f"Failure: vowels_count({word}) == {result}, expected {expected}")

The test suite covers a variety of cases, including vowels in different positions within the word, letters similar to vowels but with different sounds, and cases where the target letter is not a vowel. Adjust the test cases as needed to cover additional scenarios or clarify specific cases.
