This script includes a `vowels_count` function that counts the number of vowels in a string s, including the special case of considering 'y' as a vowel when it is at the end of the word. It also includes a `test_vowels_count` function with example tests to verify the correctness of the `vowels_count` function. 

To make the code more robust, you can add more test cases to the `test_vowels_count` function to cover different scenarios and ensure that the `vowels_count` function handles various cases correctly. Feel free to add more tests to the code snippet as needed for your specific requirements.  If you want to test the script using a specific string, you can add a test case like assert vowels_count(TEST_STRING) == EXPECTED_COUNT, where TEST_STRING is the word you want to test and EXPECTED_COUNT is the expected number of vowels in that word.  You can also add more detailed tests covering different vowel patterns, double letters, and other word structures.  This will help ensure that the `vowels_count` function handles various cases effectively.  If you need help adding more test cases or have additional questions, let's discuss further!
