This script includes a `vowels_count` function that counts the number of vowels in a string, including 'y' as a vowel only if it is at the end of the word. It also includes a `test_vowels_count` function that verifies the correctness of `vowels_count` through multiple test cases. 

Note that the test case using the string "FIX" has not been included in the above code, as the word "FIX" (vowels: 1) does not match the expected output of the fix instruction, which asks for more test cases with 3 vowels. You may want to consider adding this test case to complete the validation of the function.
