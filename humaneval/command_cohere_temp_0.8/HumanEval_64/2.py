The code defines a function `vowels_count` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the number of vowels in the string, counting 'y' as a vowel only when it is at the end of the word. This function is then tested through a series of test cases in the `test_vowels_count` function. 

To improve the clarity of the code, I returned the sum of a generator expression instead of using a list comprehension in the `vowels_count` function. This change eliminates the need for a `list` constructor and the `sum` function. Additionally, I updated the `test_vowels_count_test_case` function to use the more concise `assert` statement for assertion checking. 

To enhance reusability, I have also included a test suite with a `test_vowels_count` function that provides comprehensive tests for the `vowels_count` function, covering different scenarios and edge cases. 

This code is an improved version of the initial prompt and facilitates the counting of vowels in a string, taking into account the specificity of the English language.
