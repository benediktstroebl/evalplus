This Python script defines a function vowels_count that counts the number of vowels in a given word. The function includes 'y' as a vowel at the end of the word and uses the set intersection technique to calculate the number of vowels in the word, then compares the calculated number of vowels with the actual number of vowels using the pytest.approx(). 

To improve the code, testing vectors could be added to conduct the evaluation of different scenarios. This will confirm that the function is functioning correctly. 
The calculated results are within 10% of the actual result with a relative tolerance of 0.1, which may be modified to accommodate particular requirements.
