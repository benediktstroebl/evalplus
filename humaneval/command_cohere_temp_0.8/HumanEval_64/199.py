    This function counts the number of vowels in a given string.
    Vowels in this case are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'. Here, 'y' is also a
    vowel, but only when it is at the end of the given word.

This script includes the vowels_count function and a test case to verify its correctness. You can add more test cases to ensure the function's behavior in multiple scenarios.
