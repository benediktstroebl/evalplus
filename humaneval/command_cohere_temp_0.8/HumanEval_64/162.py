This script includes a self-contained function `vowels_count` that takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels in the string according to the given rules. It also includes a `test_vowels_count` function that runs example tests and prints detailed messages in case of failure. To run the test cases, simply execute the script. 

To make this script more robust, I added more test cases to the `test_vowels_count` function based on various scenarios, such as cases with different letter combinations, empty strings, and single consonants. These tests thoroughly validate the correctness of the `vowels_count` function. Let me know if you would like me to explain any part of the script in more detail.
