```python
def vowels_count(s):
    """
    Count the number of vowels in a given string, accounting for the vowel 'y' at the end.
    
    Args:
        s (str): The input string.
    
    Returns:
        int: The count of vowels in the string.
    """
    vowel_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char in 'aieou':
            vowel_count += 1
        elif char == 'y' and s.endswith(char):
            vowel_count += 1
    return vowel_count
```

The above code defines a function vowels_count that takes an input string s and returns the number of vowels (including the vowel 'y' at the end) present in the string. It runs through each character in the string and counts it as a vowel if it belongs to the set of vowels or if the character is 'y' and it is the last character in the string. The function is designed to adhere to the problem description provided in the context of the Markdown code block.
