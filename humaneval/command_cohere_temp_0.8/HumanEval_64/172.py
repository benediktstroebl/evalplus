This script defines a function called `vowels_count` that takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels in the string. 

The function first creates a variable `count` and initializes it to zero. Then, it iterates through each character in the string, checking if the character is a vowel. If the character is a vowel and it is not the letter 'y' at the end of the string or the end of a word (e.g., 'a' in 'havel', but 'y' in 'yoga'), the count variable is incremented. 

The function returns the count variable, which is the number of vowels in the string. 

The test cases provided in the problem statement are included here:
```python
>>> vowels_count("abcde")
2
>>> vowels_count("ACEDY")
3
>>> vowels_count(" trustworthiness ")
5
>>> vowels_count("fraenil")
4
>>> vowels_count("java")
1
>>> vowels_count("AVA")
2
>>> vowels_count(" Cyan ")
3
