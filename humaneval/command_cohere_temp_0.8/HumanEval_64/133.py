This script includes a self-contained function `vowels_count` that takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels (both regular and y at the end of a word) in the string. It also includes a test suite with additional test cases to cover different scenarios and ensure the correctness of the `vowels_count` function. 

To run the script, copy and paste it into a Python environment of your choice, and it will automatically execute the `vowels_count` function and the test cases.  The output should show the successful execution of the test cases with no errors:
```bash
test_vowels_count ...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 7 tests in 0.001s

OK
``` 
This indicates that the `vowels_count` function correctly counts the vowels in the given test cases.  If any of the tests fail, the output will indicate which test case encountered an issue and the expected results will not be equal to the actual results.  Please make sure to run the script in a Python environment that supports Markdown code blocks.  If any issues occur, review your environment configurations.
