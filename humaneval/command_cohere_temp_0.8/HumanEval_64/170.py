This Python script defines a function called `vowels_count` that takes a string as input and counts the number of vowels in the string. It defines the vowels as 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and also considers 'y' as a vowel when it is at the end of the word. The script includes a test case to demonstrate the function. 

To ensure proper counting, the script iterates through each character in the string and checks if it is one of the defined vowels. If so, it increments the count variable. The script also takes into account the 'y' character when it is the last character of the string and accordingly adjusts the count. 

This code should solve the problem and handle various test cases as described. Let me know if you would like me to adjust anything or provide further assistance!
