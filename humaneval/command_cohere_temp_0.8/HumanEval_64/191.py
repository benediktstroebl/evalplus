This code defines a function called `vowels_count` that takes a string `s` as input and counts the number of vowels in the string. The function defines the vowels as the characters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', and the character 'y' at the end of the word. It then iterates through each character in the string using a for loop and adds 1 to the count variable whenever a vowel is found. After iterating through all the characters, the function returns the total count of vowels in the string.

The two example usages demonstrate the correctness of the function.
