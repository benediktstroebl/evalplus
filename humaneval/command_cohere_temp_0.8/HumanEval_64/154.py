    This function counts the number of vowels in a given string.
    Specifically, it counts 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', and 'y' as vowels,
    but only when 'y' is at the end of the word.

    s (str): The input word whose vowels are to be counted.

    int: The number of vowels in the input word.

The `vowels_count` function takes a string `s` and iterates through each character in the string. If the character is a vowel (upper or lower case), it increments the `vowel_count` variable by 1. Additionally, if the character is a 'y' and it's at the end of the string after stripping any 'ey' combinations (to account for cases like 'happy'), it also increments the count. The final count is returned as the number of vowels in the input word.

The added test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including words with different letter combinations and varying positions of 'y' characters. For each test case, the function is called with the respective word, and the result is compared to the expected count calculated through a list comprehension. The assertion checks to ensure that the function's output matches the expected count of vowels for each word.
