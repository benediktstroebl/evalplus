This script defines a function called `vowels_count` that takes a string representing a word as input and returns the number of vowels in the string. Vowels are defined as the characters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and the letter 'y' is also considered a vowel only when it is at the end of the word. The script includes additional test cases to ensure the function's correctness. It uses assert statements to verify that the `vowels_count` function produces the expected output for each test case. You can add more test cases as described in the FIX comment. 
The script is enclosed in a code block marked with three backticks (`), and the language is specified as Python. This format will display the code correctly in a Markdown document, highlighting the code and providing proper indentation. Fcompile. The script can be run as is by copying and pasting it into a Python environment or saving it as a .py file and executing it.
