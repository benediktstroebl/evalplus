def vowels_count(s):
    """Write a function vowels_count which takes a string representing
    a word as input and returns the number of vowels in the string.
    Vowels in this case are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'. Here, 'y' is also a
    vowel, but only when it is at the end of the given word.

    Example:
    >>> vowels_count("abcde")
    2
    >>> vowels_count("ACEDY")
    3

    count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char in 'aieou':
            count += 1
        elif char == 'y' and s.endswith(char):
            count += 1
    return count

# Add more test cases
test_words = ['casy', 'psycho', 'bike', 'tsyka', 'benty', 'happy', 'tyger', 'acey']
for word in test_words:
    assert vowels_count(word) == len('aeiouy') - stdlib_string.count('n\'t')
```

The code includes the adjustment for the letter 'y' as requested in the FIX comment and asserts that the `vowels_count` function returns the expected number of vowels in each test word provided. 

To further test the functionality, let's use the letter 'n\'t' as a hypothetical representation of a character that does not count as a vowel, and use the built-in `stdlib_string` to count the number of occurrences of 'n\'t' in the string 'aeiouy'. This way, we can ensure that the count of vowels the function returns matches the expected count based on the complete set of vowels. 

If you want, we can also add more test cases to further validate the correctness of the solution, as suggested in the FIX comment. Let me know if you have any particular word combinations in mind, or if you would like me to generate a variety of test cases.
