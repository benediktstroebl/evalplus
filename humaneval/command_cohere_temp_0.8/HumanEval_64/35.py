The problem entails crafting a function, `vowels_count`, which accepts a string denoting a word and calculates the number of vowels contained within. Vowels here are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', while the letter 'y' is also deemed a vowel if it appears exclusively at the word's end. The provided examples are implemented to validate the function's correctness. 

To adapt the script to the problem, the code initially establishes a variable, `FIX`, for potential future modifications. The `vowels_count` function is implemented to:
1. Count the number of vowels in the string.
2. Increment a counter for each vowel or y if it's at the end of the word.
3. Return the counter's final value.

The test cases are then used to validate the accuracy of the `vowels_count` function.
