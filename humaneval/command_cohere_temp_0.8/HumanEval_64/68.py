This revised version of the script includes a clearer docstring, provides more comprehensive comments, and handles edge cases such as single-character words and acronyms.

The output of the test cases is as follows:
```
2
3
2
2
1
1
2
3
``` 

This revised version of the script provides a more comprehensive explanation of the code and handles more edge cases than the previous version.
