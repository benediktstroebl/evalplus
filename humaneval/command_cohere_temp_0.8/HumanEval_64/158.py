This script includes a self-contained function `vowels_count` that takes a string input and returns the number of vowels in the word, following the problem statement. It also adds a few test cases to ensure the accuracy of the `vowels_count` function. 

To verify the script, run the test case `test_vowels_count()`. This will execute the `vowels_count()` function with different word inputs and ensure that all tests pass.
