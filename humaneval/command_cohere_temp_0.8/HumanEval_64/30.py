This script includes a self-contained Python function `vowels_count` that calculates the number of vowels in a given string according to the problem statement, along with a corresponding `test_vowels_count` function to validate its correctness through several test cases. To ensure the function's behavior aligns with the problem description, the script also includes a detailed docstring with information about what the function does and how it handles special cases. Finally, the added test cases in the `test_vowels_count` function cover various scenarios to ensure the function's reliability.
