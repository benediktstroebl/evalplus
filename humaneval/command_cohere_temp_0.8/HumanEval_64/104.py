    Vowels in this case are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'. Here, 'y' is also a
    vowel, but only when it is at the end of the given word.

```

The `vowels_count` function iterates through each character in the input string `s`. If the character is a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', or 'y'), it increments the `count` variable. However, if the character is 'y' and it's the last character in the string, it also increments the count. The function returns the total count of vowels in the string.

The added test cases, stored in the `test_words` list, ensure the function's correctness by comparing it with the filtered vowel counts and making sure they're equal.

To further enhance testing, you could add more diverse words and consider adding edge cases like empty strings or strings with just one character to cover all scenarios.
