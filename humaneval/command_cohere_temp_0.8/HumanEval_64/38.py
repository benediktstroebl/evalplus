To count the number of vowels in a given string, this code uses the `vowels_count` function. It considers the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', and the letter 'y' when it is located at the end of a word, treating it as a vowel. The function iterates through the split words in the input string, checking for the conditions specifying which letters are considered vowels in the context of the problem. As a result, the function returns the total count of these vowels in the input string. The test cases included in the code demonstrate the correctness of the implementation by checking specific scenarios and comparing them to the expected results.  In this case, the fix just adds more test cases to demonstrate the correctness of the implementation.  This resolves the issue requested in the original problem.  This code can be safely compiled and run to pass the new tests.
