This script includes a function vowels_count that takes a string s as input and returns the number of vowels in the string according to the problem statement. It also includes a test_vowels_count function that tests the vowels_count function with a variety of test cases. The tests should prove that the function behaves as expected and passes with no errors. Note that the test cases can be expanded further to cover other scenarios and edge cases to fully validate the correctness of the vowels_count function.
