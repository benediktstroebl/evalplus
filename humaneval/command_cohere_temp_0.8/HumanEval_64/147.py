This Python script defines a function called `vowels_count` that takes a string as input and counts the number of vowels in the string. 

The function includes edge cases for the letter 'y', counting it as a vowel only when it is at the end of the word. 

It then provides examples that demonstrate how the `vowels_count` function works, including scenarios for different word and vowel combinations.
