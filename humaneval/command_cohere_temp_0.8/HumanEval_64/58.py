This script includes a self-contained function `vowels_count` that fulfills the criteria and incorporates tests through the `test_vowels_count` function using the `assert` statement. If the assertions pass, the script will not produce any output or return value, but the test will indicate success by stating "OK" for each passed assertion. If any assertion fails, the script will then display the assertion that failed, along with the expected and actual values, which will help pinpoint the problem and aid in debugging.
