This script defines a function called `vowels_count`, which takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels in the string. Vowels are defined as the characters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', and 'y', but only when the letter 'y' is at the end of the word, as specified in the problem statement.

The function first creates a list of all the vowels to be used in the counting later on. It then initializes a variable `count` to 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of vowels found in the string. The function then iterates through each letter in the string, checking if the letter is in the list of vowels. If it is, the `count` variable is incremented.  Lastly, when the string ends with the letter "y" and is not preceded by other conditions like "ay", "ey", or "iy", then the function also counts it as a vowel. The function finally returns the count variable, which is the number of vowels in the string. 

This code addresses the flaws in the initial response's logic by counting 'y' as a vowel only when it's at the end of the word and checking for the aforementioned conditions. It also ensures consistency in the vowels counted by considering the aforementioned conditions for the letter 'y'. 

The unit tests were also added to the code to cover multiple edge cases, ensuring the reliability of the function.
