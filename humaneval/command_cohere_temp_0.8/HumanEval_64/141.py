To ensure that the code works appropriately in all scenarios, it is essential to include additional test cases, particularly those that include letters elsewhere in the word and those that include letters combination.

This revised test suite includes more varied scenarios, comprehensively evaluating the `vowels_count` function.

```python
def test_vowels_count():
    assert vowels_count(" abc ") == 1, "Vowels counting should be case insensitive"
    assert vowels_count("123") == 0, "Should not count vowels in numbers"
    assert vowels_count("ichi") == 2, "Should count Japanese vowels"
    assert vowels_count("grenouille") == 5, "Should count vowels in French words"
    assert vowels_count("scrima") == 2, "Should count vowels in Italian words"
    assert vowels_count("áéíóú") == 5, "Should count Irish vowels"
    assert vowels_count("Angel") == 3, "Should count vowels at the start of the word"
    assert vowels_count("Lyra") == 2, "Should count 'y' as a vowel at the end of the word"
    assert vowels_count("Przybylski") == 4, "Should count vowels in Polish names"
    assert vowels_count("Rajasthan") == 6, "Should count vowels in Indian names"
    assert vowels_count("Maasai") == 4, "Should count vowels in African tribes"
    assert vowels_count("Isley") == 3, "Should count vowels in names"
