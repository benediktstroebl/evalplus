To count the number of vowels in a given string, we iterate through each character in the string using a for loop. We define a variable 'vowel_count' to keep track of how many vowels are in the string. For each character in the string, we check if it is a vowel or a 'y' at the end of the word. If so, we increment the 'vowel_count' variable. After iterating through all the characters, we return the 'vowel_count'. 

This approach ensures that 'y' is only counted as a vowel when it is at the end of the word, consistent with the problem statement. Adding the tests cited in the code validates the correctness of the solution. Feel free to add more tests to increase code coverage and ensure robustness.
