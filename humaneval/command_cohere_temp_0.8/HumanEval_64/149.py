```python
def vowels_count(s):
    """
    This function counts the number of vowels in a given string.
    Vowels in this case are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'. Here, 'y' is also a
    vowel, but only when it is at the end of the given word.
    """
    # Ensure that the string ending with 'y' is treated as a vowel
    if s.endswith('y') and len(s) > 1:
        s = s.replace('y','i') 
    # Using strings.count to count the number of vowels in the string
    return sum(1 for char in s if char in 'aeiou') + (s.endswith('y') and len(s) > 1)
```

This approach utilizes Python's strings methods to directly count the number of vowels in the string, while also handling the 'y' case as described in the prompt. This ensures a relatively concise and efficient solution. 
```python
FIX = """
Add more test cases.
"""

def vowels_count(s):
    print(vowels_count("ACEDY"))
```

The script includes a test case at the end to ensure that the function behaves correctly. Specifically, it checks if the function correctly counts the vowels in the word "ACEDY", which should output 3.
