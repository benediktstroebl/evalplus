This script defines a function `vowels_count` using a set data structure to efficiently count the number of vowels in a given string `s`, considering the special case where the letter 'y' is treated as a vowel only at the end of a word. It then applies this function to a variety of test cases, asserting that it produces the expected outputs. To count the vowels in a word with 'y' as the last character, it first uses the `sum` function to count the vowels in the word without the last character, and then includes the 'y' as a vowel only once, as needed. 

If you would like to test other word scenarios, you can add more test cases to the assert statements to validate the function's behavior across a wider range of inputs.
