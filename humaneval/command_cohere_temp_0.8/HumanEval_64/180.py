This Python script defines a function called `vowels_count` that takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels in the string. This function implements the markdown description closely and incorporates the FIX comment by counting 'y' as a vowel only when it is at the end of the word and the character preceding 'y' is a vowel. 

The script also includes an example usage of the function to count the vowels in the words "abcde" and "ACEDY", which demonstrates that the function correctly counts the vowels in these examples. 

To further enhance the functionality of this script, you may want to consider adding more test cases to cover a wide range of scenarios and ensure the accuracy of the `vowels_count` function.
