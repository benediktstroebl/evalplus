Test Cases:
```python
assert vowels_count("Thrifty") == 3
assert vowels_count("consonant") == 1
assert vowels_count("Acadamy") == 4
assert vowels_count(" privilegier") == 2
assert vowels_count("rioli") == 2
```
```

This code defines a function called `vowels_count` that takes a string as input and counts the number of vowels in the string. 

The function first creates a variable `count` and initializes it to zero, meaning that at the start there are no vowels counted. It then uses a for loop to iterate through each character in the string. 

Within the loop, the function checks if the current character is a vowel, either one of 'a' 'e' 'i' 'o' or 'u' or the character is 'y' and it is at the end of the string. In the latter case, the function uses the `endswith` string method to check if the string ends with the character 'y'. If the character is a vowel for one of the two reasons, the count variable is incremented by one, counting the presence of a vowel. 

The function then returns the final count, the total number of vowels in the string, and no other character. 
```python
assert vowels_count("Thrifty") == 3
```
This line is an example of a unittest, an individual test that verifies the behavior of the `vowels_count` function. In this specific test, we see if the function returns 3, which is the number of vowels in the word "Thrifty". 
The next unittest is:
```python
assert vowels_count("consonant") == 1
```
This line tests if the function returns 1, as there is only one vowel in the word "consonant". 
The next two unittests test the function using words with more vowels and verify that the function returns the expected number of vowels.
```python
assert vowels_count("Acadamy") == 4
assert vowels_count(" privilegier") == 2
```
Finally, this is another unittest that tests a word with more complex vowel characters.
```python
assert vowels_count("rioli") == 2
```

This set of unittests aims to test a variety of inputs to verify the correctness of the `vowels_count` function and ensure that it behaves as expected, accurately counting the number of vowels in a given input string.
