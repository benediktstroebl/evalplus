def vowels_count(s):
    """Returns the number of vowels in a string s,
    including special case for 'y' as a vowel at the end of the word"""
    import re

    return sum(1 for char in s if re.search(r'[aeiou]+$', s))

# Test cases:
assert vowels_count("abcde") == 2
assert vowels_count("Acedy") == 3
assert vowels_count("Hello") == 1
assert vowels_count("York") == 1
``` 

The `vowels_count` function uses a regular expression to check if the end of the word matches any vowel. This is done using the `re.search()` function, which returns a match object, which we convert to integer `1` (to later be sumied) if there is a match, and `0` otherwise. 

The `assert` statements can be used to verify test cases once the function is executed. 

As per your request, more test cases have been added to ensure the accuracy of the `vowels_count` function. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any of the code sections.
