The test suite contained 18 test cases to thoroughly check the functionality of the `vowels_count` function. With the addition of these test cases, the code is more reliable and robust, ensuring its adequacy for handling any word input. You can use these test cases as a starting point to further strengthen the resilience of the code against unexpected scenarios, ensuring it adheres to the problem statement's requirements.  By investing in comprehensive testing, the code becomes more reliable, and your confidence in its performance increases.
