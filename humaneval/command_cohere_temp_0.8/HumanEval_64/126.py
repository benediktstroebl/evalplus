This Python script defines a function vowels_count that takes a string input and counts the number of vowels (both regular and "y" as a vowel at the end of the word) in the string. It then includes test cases to validate the function's behavior for different inputs. You can add more test cases as outlined in the FIX comment to ensure the function's correctness across various scenarios.
