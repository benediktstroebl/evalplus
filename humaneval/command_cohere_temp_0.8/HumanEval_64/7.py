    if not s.endswith('y') and s not in vowels:
        return 0
    return sum(1 for char in s if char in vowels)
    # Since the set of vowels contains only 6 characters,
    # we can just iterate through the string and count
    # the number of characters that are in the set.

# Test cases
assert vowels_count('abcdef') == 0
assert vowels_count('acedy') == 3
assert vowels_count('aaaaaaa') == 6
assert vowels_count('bow') == 2
```

We define a set of vowels to efficiently check if a character is a vowel or not. We then use a comprehension to iterate over the string `s` and check if each character is in the `vowels` set, counting the number of vowels in the string. 

This approach ensures that the code efficiently handles a wide range of characters and provides an optimized solution even for large strings with varying patterns. 

To further enhance the code, we can add more test cases to cover additional scenarios and validate the robustness of the solution. 
Let me know if you want me to add any specific test case to further improve the function. 

This way, the solution encompasses both the problem statement and the provided test cases, achieving complete self-containment within a single Python script.
