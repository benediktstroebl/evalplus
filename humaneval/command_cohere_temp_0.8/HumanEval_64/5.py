This script defines a single function vowels_count that takes a string s as input and returns the number of vowels in the string. The function checks if each character of the input string is a vowel, ignoring 'y' if it is not the last character in the string. It iterates through the characters of the string and adds 1 to the count variable for each vowel character. After iterating through all the characters, the function returns the final count, representing the number of vowels in the input string. 

To manage the ignored 'y' case, the function uses the logic that only counts 'y' when the entire string is 'y'. This is done through the use of the `s.endswith(char)` method, which checks if the string ends with the current 'y' character. 

This solution complies with the problem statement by counting 'y' as a vowel only when it's the last character in the given word. It provides a clear and concise description of its functionality, making it easy to understand by clearly outlining the requirements and expected output.
