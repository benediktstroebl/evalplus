    vowel, but only when it is at the end of the given word.

This script defines a function vowels_count which takes a string s as input and returns the number of vowels in the string. It defines the vowels as 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', and specifies that the letter 'y' is also a vowel at the end of the word. The script then provides examples of this function in use, asking the function to count the vowels in the words "abcde" and "ACEDY", and receiving answers of 2 and 3, respectively. 

Would you like to have more example test cases to verify this script?
