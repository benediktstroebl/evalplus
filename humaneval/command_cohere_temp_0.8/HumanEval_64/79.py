To execute this code and run the tests, make sure to have Python installed on your system and apply the appropriate syntax formatting as needed. This will help ensure that the code is executable and displays accurate results. You can also add more test cases to the list to further validate the correctness of the `vowels_count` function. 

Additionally, if you encounter any issues with code execution, make sure to examine your Python environment and settings to ensure that it supports Markdown code blocks.
