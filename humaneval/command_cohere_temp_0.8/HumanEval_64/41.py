This script provides a function vowels_count for counting the vowels in a string, according to the given specifications. It includes additional test cases to cover a variety of scenarios, including cases where the input string is not a string, and ensures proper error handling. The script also demonstrates how to use and validate the function's behavior via example usage and an interactive session. 

Let me know if you would like me to make any revisions or explain any of the steps in the code!
