This script includes a self-contained function `vowels_count` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the number of vowels in the string, with the rule that 'y' is considered a vowel only when it is the last character in the word. The `test_vowels_count` function is also included to verify the functionality of the `vowels_count` function. 

To ensure the `vowels_count` function is thoroughly tested and functionally correct, feel free to add more test cases to the `test_vowels_count` function, covering a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases and different word compositions.
