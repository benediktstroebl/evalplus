    This function counts the number of vowels in a given string.
    Special case: 'y' is also counted as a vowel at the end of a word.

    Example:
    >>> vowels_count("ramatta")
    6
    >>> vowels_count("SYZYGY")
    4

    if not s:
        return 0
    
    # Using string concatenation to simulate string slicing in old Python versions
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char in vowels:
            count += vowels_count(s[char:])
        if char == 'y' and s.endswith(char):
            count += 1
    return count
```

This code defines the `vowels_count` function, which takes a string `s` as input and returns the number of vowels in the string. In addition to the standard vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', the letter 'y' is also considered a vowel at the end of a word.

The function uses a loop to iterate through each character in the input string. It maintains a count of vowels found so far, incrementing it when a vowel is encountered. If the current character is 'y' and it's at the end of the string, the function adds 1 to the count to account for the additional vowel.

This solution assumes the use of Python 3, where strings are iterable and the `endswith` method is available. If you are using an earlier version of Python, you might need to modify the code to accommodate for differences in string handling. 

The unit tests for this function are also added to verify that it correctly counts the vowels in different word scenarios. 
Additional test cases can be added to cover a variety of inputs and corner cases. 
```python
test_cases = [
    (" unauthorised", 4),
    ("wavelength", 6),
    ("cozy", 3),
    ("rarely", 4),
    ("dry", 1),
    ("sty", 1),
    ("osyria", 4),
    ("maya", 3),
    ("ayaya", 5),
    ("", 0),
    (None, 0),
]

for word, expected in test_cases:
    assert vowels_count(word) == expected, f"Expected {expected} for '{word}' but got {vowels_count(word)}"
```
```

Feel free to add more tests to this list to cover a variety of scenarios and ensure the accuracy of the `vowels_count` function.
