    Vowels in this case are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'. Here, 'y' is also a
    vowel, but only when it is at the end of the given word.

```

This code defines a function called `vowels_count` that takes a string as input and counts the number of vowels in the string, with additional criteria for counting certain 'y' characters. The function first evaluates a generator expression that counts valid vowels or qualifying 'y' characters, then uses `sum()` to add up these counts. It excludes the character 'y' if it is not at the end of the string, but includes it if it is the last character.
