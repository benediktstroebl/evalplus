```python
def vowels_count(s):
    """
    Args:
        s (str): A word represented as a string.

    Returns:
        int: The number of vowels in the word.
             Here, 'y' is also a vowel, but only when it is at the end of the word.
    """
    # Your code here.
    # Ensure it adheres to the prompt's specifications.

    # Convert the string to lowercase to handle uppercase vowels and simplify the process
    s = s.lower()
    # Count the vowels without considering 'y' at the end
    vowel_count = s.count("aeiou")
    # Check if the last character is 'y' and add 1 to the count
    if s[-1] == "y":
        vowel_count += 1
    return vowel_count
```

This code provides a solution for the problem as requested. It first converts the input string to lowercase to ensure it accurately counts all vowels, regardless of case. It then uses the `count()` method to tally the number of vowels (\'a\', \'e\', \'i\', \'o\', and \'u\'). To account for the specification regarding \"y\" as a vowel only at the end of the word, a check is performed on the last character, and if it is \"y\", 1 is added to the vowel count. The function finishes by returning the total number of vowels in the word, considering the specified rules. 

This code is self-contained and should work as required without any external dependencies or additional code.
