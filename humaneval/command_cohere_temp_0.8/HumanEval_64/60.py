This script defines a self-contained function `vowels_count` that takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels in the string. It also contains a `test_vowels_count` function with several test cases to ensure the correct operation of the `vowels_count` function. 

The `vowels_count` function counts the number of vowels in a given string. In this case, the vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', and 'y', with the exception that 'y' is only counted as a vowel if it is at the end of the word. The function returns the total count of vowels in the string. 

The `test_vowels_count` function tests the `vowels_count` function with different inputs and confirms that the function returns the expected output for each test case. The `FIX` variable contains a string that instructs us to add more test cases for the `vowels_count` function. By adding more test cases, we ensure that the function behaves correctly for all possible inputs.
