This code defines a function called `vowels_count` that takes a string representing a word as input and counts the number of vowels in the word. It defines a set called `vowels` that contains all the vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'. It initializes an integer variable `ans` to 0, which stores the count of vowels in the word.

Then, for each character in the input word `s`, it checks if the character is a vowel. If it is, it increments the answer by 1. After processing all the characters, if the word ends with 'y' and it isn't the suffix of the word 'ay', it also increments the answer by 1 to account for the special case where 'y' is also a vowel at the end of the word. 

The code ensures that both the mentioned test cases pass by correctly counting the vowels. 
The first test case, `vowels_count("abcde")`, returns 2, as the word "abcde" contains the vowels 'a' and 'e'. 
The second test case, `vowels_count("ACEDY")`, returns 3, as the word "ACEDY" contains the vowels 'a', 'e', and 'y' at the end.
