This Python script defines a function called `vowels_count` that takes a string as input and counts the number of vowels in the string, with the exception of the letter `y` when it is not the last character in the word. The script includes test cases to validate the function's behavior. The expected output for each test case is commented with an `assert` statement, checking if the output of `vowels_count` is correct. 

If you need help understanding the code, I can provide a detailed explanation. Let me know if you would like me to clarify any part of the code or suggest improvements to make it even more concise and efficient.
