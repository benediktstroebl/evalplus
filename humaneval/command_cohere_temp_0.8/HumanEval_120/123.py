```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    arr_copy = arr.copy()
    arr_copy.sort()
    return arr_copy[:k]
```
This Python script defines a function called `maximum` which takes two arguments - a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. This function sorts the list `arr` and then returns the first `k` elements of the sorted list, thereby providing a list of the maximum `k` numbers in the input list. 

This function is standalone and can be called from other Python scripts to solve the problem as outlined in the provided markdown code block. 
This function works by first copying the input list (`arr`), sorting the copy, and then returning the first `k` elements of the sorted copy. This ensures that the original list remains unchanged, and the returned list reflects the maximum elements given the constraint of selecting up to `k` elements. 

This approach efficiently solves the problem while maintaining the original list's integrity. H owever, feel free to customize the code to your preferences, and let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like to discuss more coding problems or concepts!
