Here's a Python script that includes a function maximum_k that solves the problem:
```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    arr.sort()
    return arr[:k]

# Test Suite
def test_maximum():
    assert maximum([-3, -4, 5], 3) == [-4, -3, 5]
    assert maximum([4, -4, 4], 2) == [4, 4]
    assert maximum([-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], 1) == [2]
    assert maximum([42, -42, 42], 2) == [42, 42]

test_maximum()
```

The `maximum` function takes an array `arr` and an integer `k` as input. It sorts the array and returns the maximum `k` elements. The `test_maximum` function tests the `maximum` function with example cases, and the `assert` statements check that the output of `maximum` is correct for each case. When the code is executed, the `test_maximum` function is called to ensure that the function maximum correctly solves the problem.  This safeguards against any unintended changes that might affect the correctness of the code.  Feel free to add more tests to increase reliability and cover more edge cases if needed.  This can help ensure that the function remains accurate for a variety of inputs.  And it helps to follow best practices of robust code development.
