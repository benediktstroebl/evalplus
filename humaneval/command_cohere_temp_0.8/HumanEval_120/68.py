```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    arr_copy = arr.copy()
    arr_copy.sort()
    return arr_copy[:k]
```
This function takes in two parameters, a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. The function sorts the list and returns the maximum k numbers in the list. The function is self-contained and can be run independently. 

Let's go through the steps of the algorithm with a few examples:
**Example 1**:
Input: arr = [-3, -4, 5], k = 3

1. The input array is [-3, -4, 5], and we need to find the maximum 3 numbers.
2. The `arr_copy` is sorted in the range of [-4, -3, 5], selecting the first 3 elements of the copied array returns the maximum 3 numbers, [-4, -3, 5].

**Example 2**:
Input: arr = [4, -4, 4], k = 2

1. The input array is [4, -4, 4], and we need to find the maximum 2 numbers.
2. The `arr_copy` is sorted in the range of [-4, 4], selecting the first 2 elements of the copied array returns the maximum 2 numbers, [4, 4].

**Example 3**:
Input: arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], k = 1

1. The input array is [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], and we need to find the maximum 1 number.
2. The `arr_copy` is sorted in the range of [1, 2, -2, -3, 2, 4], selecting the first 1 element of the copied array returns the maximum 1 number, [2].

The algorithm has a time complexity of O(k * log(n)) as it requires sorting the array, which takes O(n * log(n)) and we are selecting k elements which takes O(k). The space complexity is O(n) as we use the array copy operation, which creates a new array of the same size as the input array.
