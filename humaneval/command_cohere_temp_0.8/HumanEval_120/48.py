```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    arr_copy = arr.copy()
    arr_copy.sort()
    return arr_copy[:k]
```
This Python script defines a function called `maximum` that takes two arguments - a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. This function sorts the list `arr` and returns the first `k` elements of the sorted list, thus providing a list of the maximum `k` numbers in the input list. 

This approach utilizes Python's list copying method to create a new list (`arr_copy`) that is subsequently sorted. This ensures that the original list remains unchanged, and the sorting does not impact the original data arrangement. The function then returns the first `k` elements from the sorted list, providing the maximum k numbers from the input list. 

This approach boasts an efficiency of O(log(n)) due to the sorting process, where `n` represents the length of the input list. This makes it a relatively efficient solution compared to manual sorting or brute-force approaches like nested loops.
