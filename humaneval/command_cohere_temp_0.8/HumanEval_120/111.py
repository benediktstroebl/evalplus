```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    arr_copy = sorted(arr)
    
    return arr_copy[:k]
```
This function sorts the array and returns the first k elements. The sorting ensures that the maximum elements appear at the beginning of the array, so returning the first k elements gives you the maximum k numbers. Let's go through a test case to illustrate how it works: 

**Test Case:**
```
Input: arr = [4, -4, 4, 7, 2, 11, 3], k = 3
Output: [4, 4, 7]
```

Steps:
1. The input array is rotated left to create `arr_copy`. This ensures the elements are in ascending order: `[(-4), (-4), (4), (7), (2), (11), (3)]`.
2. Then, the function returns the first 3 elements from the sorted array, which are `[(-4), (-4), (4)]`, which are also the maximum 3 numbers in the original array. 

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(k * log n) due to the sorting and is memory efficient, only using additional memory for the sort and return operations.
