Here's a Python script that contains a function that solves the given problem:
```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    return arr[:k]

# Test cases
print(maximum([-3, -4, 5], 3))
print(maximum([4, -4, 4], 2))
print(maximum([-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], 1))
```

The function `maximum` takes in an array `arr` and an integer `k` as inputs and returns a sorted list of the maximum `k` numbers in `arr`. In the self-contained script, we can see examples of how the function can be tested. The given examples match the test cases in the prompt; however, the script can handle any valid input as it uses sorted data to extract the top k elements.
