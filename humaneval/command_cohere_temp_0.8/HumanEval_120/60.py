```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    arr_copy = sorted(arr)
    
    return arr_copy[:k]
```

This function `maximum` takes in two parameters, `arr` and `k`. The function sorts the array and then returns the first `k` elements. 

This solution is concise and easy to understand. It leverages the sorting function to handle the extracting of the maximum elements. 

The following is a test that can be used to verify the functionality of the function:
```python
arr = [-3, -4, 5]
k = 3

result = maximum(arr, k)

print(result)  # [-4, -3, 5]
``` 

This should return the expected output of `[-4, -3, 5]` as it is the maximum of the array that takes up to `3` elements. 

The function's time complexity is O(k * log k), where k is the length of the array. This is because the function only needs to sort the array once, and each element in the array needs to be compared with at most k elements to determine its final sorted position. 

The space complexity is O(1) as the maximum function doesn't require any additional space.
