```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    arr_copy = sorted(arr)
    
    return arr_copy[:k]
```

This function `maximum` takes in two parameters, `arr` and `k`, where `arr` is a list of integers and `k` is a positive integer. The function sorts the given array and extracts the first `k` elements from the sorted array, returning them as a list. This ensures that the returned list contains the maximum `k` numbers from the original input array.
