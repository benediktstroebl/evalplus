```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    arr_copy = sorted(arr)
    return arr_copy[:k]
```

This function `maximum(arr, k)` takes in an array `arr` and an integer `k` as inputs, sorts the array, and returns the maximum `k` elements in the array. 

This solution is concise and efficient with a time complexity of O(k log n) where n is the length of the input array, but it lacks robustness as it assumes that the input is valid and doesn't check for such validity. It also doesn't handle various edge cases, such as when `k` is greater than the length of the array. 

If you want, I can provide a more detailed explanation of this code or discuss further ideas and concepts related to this problem, just let me know!
