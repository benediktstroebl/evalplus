Here's a Python script that includes a function maximum_k that solves the problem:
```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    arr.sort()
    return arr[:k]

# Test Suite
def test_maximum():
    assert maximum([-3, -4, 5], 3) == [-4, -3, 5]
    assert maximum([4, -4, 4], 2) == [4, 4]
    assert maximum([-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], 1) == [2]
    assert maximum([42, -42, 42, -10, 10], 2) == [42, 42]

test_maximum()
```

The `maximum` function sorts the input array `arr` and then returns the first `k` elements from the sorted array, producing the maximum k numbers in `arr`. 

The `test_maximum()` function is a test suite that contains multiple test cases to ensure the `maximum` function behaves as expected. It asserts that the output of the `maximum` function for different input arrays `arr` and integers `k` matches the expected output.

Before running the test suite, you need to execute the following lines at the beginning of the script:
```python
# Assuming you are using Python 3
import pytest
```

Then, to run the test suite, use this command:
```bash
pytest
```

The test suite will execute the `test_maximum()` function, which will run the `maximum` function on various input arrays and assert that the results are correct.
