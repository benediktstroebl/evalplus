```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    arr_copy = sorted(arr)
    
    return arr_copy[:k]
```

This function `maximum` takes in two parameters, `arr` and `k`, where `arr` is a list of integers and `k` is a positive integer. The function sorts the given array and returns the maximum `k` numbers as a list. This algorithm's efficiency is O(log(N) + k), where N is the size of the input array. 

This code efficiently solves the problem by sorting the array and returning the first `k` elements, while maintaining a time complexity that is linear in the size of the output. Let me know if you would like me to explain any part of the code in more detail. I can also provide insights into how tests could be created for this function.
