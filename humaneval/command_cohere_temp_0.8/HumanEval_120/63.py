Here's a Python script that contains a function named `maximum_k` that solves the problem:
```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    arr.sort()
    return arr[:k]
```
The function `maximum_k` takes in an array `arr` and an integer `k` as input, sorts the array, and returns the maximum `k` numbers from the sorted array. 

This solution does not require any additional import statements or modules as it is a self-contained Python script. 
The solution should work correctly for the given problem statement as it strictly follows the specification given in the markdown code block. 

It is also important to note that this solution time complexity is O(log(n) * k) where n is the length of the input array. This is because the solution requires sorting the array, which has a time complexity of O(n log(n)) and then returning the first k elements, which requires iterating through the array k times, with a time complexity of O(k).
