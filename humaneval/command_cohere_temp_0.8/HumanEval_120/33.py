```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    arr_copy = sorted(arr)
    
    return arr_copy[:k]
```

This function sorts the array `arr`, which is assumed to be of length 1k, and then returns the first `k` elements of the sorted array. 

This will return the maximum k numbers in `arr` as per the prompt, but without specifying any programming guidelines like Python 3 compatibility, explicit return statements, or docstrings. Let me know if you'd like me to rewrite this response to include best practices!
