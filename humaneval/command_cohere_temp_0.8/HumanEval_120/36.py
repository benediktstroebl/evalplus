Here's a Python script that contains a function named `maximum_k` that solves the problem:
```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    arr.sort()
    return arr[:k]

# Test Suite
def test_maximum():
    assert maximum([-3, -4, 5], 3) == [-4, -3, 5]
    assert maximum([4, -4, 4], 2) == [4, 4]
    assert maximum([-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], 1) == [2]

test_maximum()
```

The function `maximum_k` takes two arguments - a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. It sorts the array and returns the first `k` elements. The test suite, which is a fundamental part of robust code, verifies that the function behaves as expected for a variety of inputs. You can add more tests to the test suite to cover a broader range of scenarios and edge cases as needed.
