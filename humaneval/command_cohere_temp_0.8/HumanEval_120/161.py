```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    return arr[:k]
```

This function `maximum` takes in an array `arr` and an integer `k` as inputs, sorts the array, and then returns the first `k` elements from the sorted array, ensuring that these are the maximum elements. 

This approach efficiently returns the maximum `k` numbers in `arr` in a sorted manner, satisfying the constraints and requirements outlined in the problem. Let's discuss the approach in depth and dive into potential variations and relevant coding concepts. 

### Explanation and Approach Analysis

The approach to this problem is straightforward and intuitive:
1. **Sorting:** First, we sort the entire array `arr` in ascending order using the built-in Python `sorted` function. Sorting the array ensures that the maximum elements will be at the beginning of the list in their sorted order. 
2. **Slice:** To retrieve the maximum `k` numbers, we use slicing `arr[:k]`. Slicing takes a portion of the array from the beginning using the `:` operator. By slicing `arr` with `k`, we obtain the first `k` elements from the sorted array, which represent the maximum `k` numbers in the original input array. 

This approach leverages basic Python functionalities to solve the problem efficiently and with minimal code. 

### Variation and Flexibility

The problem statement mentions that the length of the array may range from 1 to 1000, and the elements could be in the range of [-1000, 1000]. The provided solution is versatile and adaptable to different scenarios:
1. **Sorts Ascending:** The solution effectively handles various input scenarios, regardless of whether the input array is sorted or not, as it sorts the array as part of the solution process. This ensures that the maximum elements are appropriately identified. 
2. **Adaptable Input Range:** The solution operates on the provided assumption that the input array could be quite large (up to 1000 elements). Python's `sorted` function and slicing operation remain efficient even for larger arrays, ensuring the solution is viable in this scenario. 

### Relevant Python Concepts

This problem showcases the use of several Python concepts:
1. **Built-in Functions:** The use of the `sorted` function demonstrates Python's rich collection of built-in functions that can simplify complex tasks, such as sorting. 
2. **Slicing:** The use of slicing `arr[:k]` is a common and crucial concept in Python, allowing the function to extract the relevant output from the sorted array efficiently. 
3. **Functionality & Versatility:** Python's ability to handle diverse data types and built-in functions like `sorted` contributes to writing more versatile and functional code.
