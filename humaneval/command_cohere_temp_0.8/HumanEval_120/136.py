```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    arr_copy = sorted(arr)
    
    return arr_copy[:k]
```

This Python script defines a function called `maximum` which takes two arguments - a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. This function sorts the input list `arr` in ascending order and then returns the first `k` elements of the sorted list, providing a list of the maximum `k` numbers in the input list. 

The self-contained code block effectively solves the problem statement and provides the maximum `k` numbers in the input list as specified.
