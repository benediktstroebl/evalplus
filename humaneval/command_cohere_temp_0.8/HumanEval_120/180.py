Here's a Python script that contains a function named `maximum_k` that addresses the problem presented:
```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    arr.sort()
    return arr[:k]

# Test Suite
arr1 = [-3, -4, 5]
k1 = 3
print(maximum(arr1, k1))  # Expected output: [-4, -3, 5]

arr2 = [4, -4, 4]
k2 = 2
print(maximum(arr2, k2))  # Expected output: [4, 4]

arr3 = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1]
k3 = 1
print(maximum(arr3, k3))  # Expected output: [2]
```

The `maximum_k` function takes in two parameters, `arr` (the array of integers) and `k` (the desired length of the output list). It sorts the array and then returns the first `k` elements of the sorted array, providing a list of the maximum `k` numbers in the input array. 

The test suite includes three test cases, and each test case calls the `maximum_k` function with the input values and prints the result. The expected output for each test case is also printed, making it easy to compare against the actual output.
