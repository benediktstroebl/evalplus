```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    arr_copy = arr.copy()
    arr_copy.sort()
    return arr_copy[:k]
```

This function sorts the array `arr` and then returns the first `k` elements from the sorted array. It uses the sorting function directly on the passed array and does not mutate the original array, instead using a copy of it, and returns the max k numbers accordingly. 

This solution should pass correctly for the examples range from 1 to 3 as described in the problem. Let me know if you would like to make any amendments to the function or provide any other feedback!
