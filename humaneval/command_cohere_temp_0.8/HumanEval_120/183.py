Here's a Python script that contains a function that solves the given problem:
```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    return arr[:k]

# Test cases
print(maximum([-3, -4, 5], 3))
print(maximum([4, -4, 4], 2))
print(maximum([-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], 1))
```

The function 'maximum' takes two parameters, a list of integers 'arr' and an integer 'k'. The function sorts the list and returns the first 'k' elements of the sorted list, ensuring the maximum 'k' numbers in the input array are returned as requested. The test cases are also included to validate the function. 

The code is encapsulated and solves the problem in a standalone fashion, adhering to the problem's prompt. Feel free to test it with other input combinations!
