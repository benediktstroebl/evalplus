Here's a Python script that contains a function named `maximum_k` that solves the problem:
```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    return arr[:k]

# Test Suite
def test_maximum():
    assert maximum([-3, -4, 5], 3) == [-4, -3, 5]
    assert maximum([4, -4, 4], 2) == [4, 4]
    assert maximum([-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], 1) == [2]

test_maximum()
```

The function `maximum_k` takes two parameters, a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. The function sorts the list and returns the first `k` elements. To ensure proper sorting, the function utilizes the `sorted` function which handles various cases of negative and positive numbers, as well as various lengths of the provided array. 

The `test_maximum` function is a test suite that contains multiple test cases to cover different scenarios. It asserts that the `maximum_k` function behaves as expected for each case, thus ensuring the correctness of the solution. 

To run the tests, simply call `test_maximum()` and the assertions will determine if the code behaves as expected. 

This solution makes use of Python's built-in sorting functionality, which makes the code concise and efficient, achieving a time complexity of O(k * log n) where k is the kth part of the sorted list, and n is the length of the input list.
