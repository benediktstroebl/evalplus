```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    arr_copy = arr.copy()
    arr_copy.sort()
    return arr_copy[:k]
```

This function sorts the array `arr` and then returns the first `k` elements from the sorted array. As these elements will be the largest `k` integers in the original array, this function efficiently solves the task. 

This approach takes advantage of Python's built-in sort function and native indexing to efficiently solve the problem in constant time complexity `O(k)` without the need for any additional libraries. 

If you were interested in a purely Python-based solution, this would be an ideal response. However, if you are open to incorporating external libraries, top contributions using them would be an efficient way to improve the overall solution.
