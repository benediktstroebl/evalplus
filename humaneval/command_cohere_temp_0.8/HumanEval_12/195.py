```python
from typing import List, Optional

def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    if not strings:
        return None
    elif len(set(strings)) == 1:
        return strings[0]
    return max(strings, key=len)
```
This Python script defines a function called longest in the code above that takes a list of strings, strings, as input. It returns either None or the longest string from the input list. If the input list is empty, it returns None indicating the lack of any strings to consider. If there's only one unique string length in the list, it returns the lone string, assuming it's the longest. However, if there are multiple strings of the same length, it uses the max function with the len function as the key argument to compare and return the longest string, ensuring consistent results with different lengths.

Here is a test suite that can be used to further verify the functionality of the longest function:
```python
def test_longest_none(empty_list: None):
    assert longest(empty_list) is None

def test_longest_single(single_string_list: List[str]):
    assert longest(single_string_list) == single_string_list[0]

def test_longest_multiple(multiple_strings: List[str]):
    assert longest(multiple_strings) == multiple_strings[0]
```
Each individual test case is represented by three functions in this test suite: test_longest_none, test_longest_single, and test_longest_multiple. Each of these tests validates a specific scenario by asserting certain conditions against expected outcomes. This approach allows for the systematic testing of various conditions, increasing confidence in the correctness of the longest function.
