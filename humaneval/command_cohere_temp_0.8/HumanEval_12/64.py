```python
from typing import List, Optional

def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    if not strings:
        return None
    elif len(set(strings)) == 1:
        return strings[0]
    return max(strings, key=len)
```
This Python script provides a function called longest as per your prompt, taking a list of strings as input and returning either None, or the longest string in the list, considering length and subsequent strings in case of equal lengths. The function initially checks if the string list is empty, returning None if so. It then assesses if there's only one string in the input, rendering it directly. Conversely, if there are multiple strings, it employs the max function, specifying the key as the string's length to retrieve the longest one.
