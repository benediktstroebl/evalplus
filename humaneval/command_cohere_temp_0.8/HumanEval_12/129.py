```python
from typing import List, Optional

def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    if not strings:
        return None
    longestString = max(strings, key=len)
    return longestString if len(longestString) == max(len(s) for s in strings) else longest(
        [s for s in strings if s != longestString]
    )
```

The code defines a function `longest` that takes in a list of strings and returns either the longest string in the list, the first one in case of equal longest lengths, or None if the input list is empty. The logic behind the approach is to first check if the list is empty, returning None if so. If not, it uses the `max` function with the `key` argument to find the longest string, considering the length of each string in the list as the key to maximize. 

Finally, the code verifies if the length of the longest string is unique, returning it if so, or recursively calling the function with the list of strings minus the longest string if not, effectively handling the case of multiple strings of identical length. 

This ensures that the function follows the problem's requirements, returning the longest string in the list while preferring the first string of equal length. 

The function also handles potential empty input gracefully, returning None in such cases. 

This approach has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the use of the `max` function with a custom key, and a space complexity of O(n) since it stores the list of strings in memory.  It handles the delicate balance of preferring the first string among those of equal length through a recursive approach while efficiently determining the longest string in the list.
