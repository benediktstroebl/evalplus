```python
from typing import List, Optional

def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    if not strings:
        return None
    elif len(set(strings)) == 1:
        return strings[0]
    else:
        return max(strings, key=len)
```
This Python script defines a function called longest in the List -> Optional[str] type signature. The function accepts a list of strings and returns the longest string present in the list. If the list is empty, it returns None. If the list contains only one string, it returns that string. If there are multiple strings of the same length, it returns the first one among them, as specified by the problem statement. This behavior is confirmed by the tests proposed in the original challenge.
