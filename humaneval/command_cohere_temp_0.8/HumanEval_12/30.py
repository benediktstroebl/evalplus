Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List, Optional

def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    """ Out of list of strings, return the longest one. Return the first one in case of multiple
    strings of the same length. Return None in case the input list is empty.
    >>> longest([])
    >>> longest(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'a'
    >>> longest(['a', 'bb', 'ccc'])
    'ccc'
    """
    max_string: Optional[str] = None
    for string in strings:
        if len(string) > len(max_string):
            max_string = string
        elif len(string) == len(max_string) and max_string == None:
            max_string = string
    return max_string
```
The function `longest` takes a list of strings as input and returns either the longest string in the list, the first string 
that is the same length as the longest string, or None if the list is empty. It uses a for loop to iterate through 
the list of strings and keeps track of the longest string found so far using the `max_string` variable. 
The variable is initialized as None, and the loop starts sampling strings from the list. 

If a string is longer than the `max_string`, it becomes the new `max_string`. If the current string is the same 
length as the `max_string` and the `max_string` is None, it means it's the first occurrence of such a string 
and it replaces the `max_string`. The loop iterates through the list and at the end the `max_string` 
represents the longest string among them. The function returns the value of `max_string`. 

The `longest` function satisfies the requirements of returning the longest string, returning the first 
string that is the same length as the longest string, and returning None for an empty input list. 
It can be used with empty lists, single strings, and lists of strings of different lengths. 
The function is also standalone and does not depend on any external variables or functions. 
It can be called directly with a list of strings to get the longest string. G
