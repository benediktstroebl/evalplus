```python
from typing import List, Optional

def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    if not strings:
        return None
    elif len(set(strings)) == 1:
        return strings[0]
    else:
        return max(strings, key=len)
```

This code defines a function `longest` that takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest string in the list. If there are multiple strings of the same length, it returns the first one. If the input list is empty, it returns `None`. The logic behind this function involves three main steps:
1. Handling Edge Case: First, it checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns `None` since there are no strings to consider.
2. Handling Single String: If there's only one unique string in the list, it returns that string since it's the longest possible outcome.
3. Handling Multiple Strings: In the case of multiple strings with different lengths, it employs the `max` function with the `key` argument set to the length of the string to ensure it retrieves the longest one. 

The method uses the `typing` module to gain the benefits of type annotations and the `Optional` class to handle the empty input scenario. This approach allows for a clear and concise function that is both effective and adaptable, catering to various scenarios and data conditions.
