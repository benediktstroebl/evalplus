Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List, Optional

def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    if not strings:
        return None
    elif len(set(strings)) == 1:
        return strings[0]
    longest_idx = max(range(len(strings)), key=lambda i: len(strings[i]))
    return strings[longest_idx]
```
This script includes the `longest` function that takes a list of strings as input and returns either None, or the longest string from the list, following the specification. The self-contained nature of this function allows it to be dropped into a Python environment and immediately used without the need for further dependencies. 

Here's an example of how to use the `longest` function:
```python
print(longest(['a', 'bb', 'ccc']))  # Outputs: ccc
print(longest(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']))  # Outputs: d
print(longest(['foo', 'bar', 'fooz']))  # Outputs: fooz
print(longest([]))  # Outputs: None
``` 

This function handles the edge cases outlined in the problem statement, including an empty list, lists with one unique string, and lists with multiple strings of the same max length. 

The function relies on the `typing` module introduced in Python 3.8 for strong typing, ensuring the function has the right expectations and behaviors with regards to the input. It also uses `lambda` functions with the max function to find the index of the longest string in the list.
