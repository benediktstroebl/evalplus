```python
from typing import List, Optional

def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    if not strings:
        return None
    elif len(set(strings)) == 1:
        return strings[0]
    return max(strings, key=len)
```
This Python script defines a function called longest in the code above that takes a list of strings, called strings, as input, and returns the longest string from the list. If the input list is empty, the function returns None. If there's only one string in the list, the function returns the unique string, regardless of its length. Otherwise, the function uses the max function, passing a key parameter with the len function as a callback to calculate the length of each string in the list, ensuring the longest string is returned. This approach handles the scenarios of an empty list, a list with one unique string, and a list with multiple strings efficiently and returns the correct longest string. 

Here is an example of how you can use the longest function:
```python
longest(['a', 'bb', 'ccc'])
```
**Output:**
ccc

The longest string in the list is "ccc," and it will be returned by the function since it is the longest string in terms of character count. 

The function will return 'a,' the only unique string in the list, since the list contains only three distinct strings, all of which are of equal length. 

Finally, the function will return None, which signifies that there is no longest string to be found because the input list is empty. 

In all cases, the function will return the longest or relevant string, or None if the input list is empty, making it a versatile and useful function for handling strings in list formats.
