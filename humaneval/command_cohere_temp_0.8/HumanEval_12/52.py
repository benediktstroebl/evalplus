```python
from typing import List, Optional

def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    if not strings:
        return None
    elif len(set(strings)) == 1:
        return strings[0]
    else:
        return max(strings, key=len)
```

This code defines a function `longest` that takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest string in the list. If there are multiple strings of the same length, it returns the first one. If the list is empty, it returns `None`. The logic behind this approach involves three cases:
1. The `if not strings` condition checks if the input list is empty. If true, it returns `None` because there are no strings to consider.
2. The `elif len(set(strings)) == 1` condition checks if there is only one unique string length in the list. If true, it means there are no long strings, so it returns the only string in the list.
3. The `else` condition performs a `max` function on the list, considering the length of each string as the key to determine the longest string, returning it as the result.

This approach ensures that the function handles various scenarios and returns the correct longest string from the list.
