Here's a Python script that includes a function `do_algebra` which takes two lists, `operator` and `operand`, and returns the result of the algebraic expression created using the two input lists:
```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    num_operands = len(operand)
    expr = []
    for i in range(num_operands - 1):
        expr.append(operand[i])
        for j in range(i + 1, num_operands):
            operator_str = operator[j - i - 1]
            if operator_str == '+':
                expr.append(expr[i] + expr[j])
            elif operator_str == '-':
                expr.append(expr[i] - expr[j])
            elif operator_str == '*':
                expr.append(expr[i] * expr[j])
            elif operator_str == '//':
                expr.append(expr[i] // expr[j])
            elif operator_str == '**':
                expr.append(expr[i] ** expr[j])
    return expr[-1]
```

The script includes a function `do_algebra` which takes two lists as input, `operator` and `operand`, and returns the result of the algebraic expression created using the two input lists. The function uses nested loops to combine the elements of the `operand` list according to the operation indicated by each element of the `operator` list.

The core logic of the algorithm is:
1. Iterate from 0 to `num_operands - 2` (since the last operand is not paired with an operator). For each iteration, add the expression to the expression list.
2. Iterate from `i + 1` to `num_operands - 1` to pair each operator with subsequent operands.
3. Apply the operator to the two operands in the same way as the spec says.
4. Return the last element of the expression list, which is the result.

This approach is concise and efficient, with a time complexity of O(n^2) where n is the length of the `operand` list.

The code assumes that the lengths of both the `operator` and `operand` lists are such that the algorithm's assumption is true, and also that the `operand` list contains only positive integers, as stated in the spec. 

It's also worth noting that there are other ways to solve this problem that may be more efficient for very large inputs, such as using a heap or memoization. However, this solution is straightforward and will work for any input size. 

Also, there are no explicit assumptions about the data type of the expressions in the specs, therefore, the output is also considered an integer in this code.
