Here's a Python script that solves the problem you've described using a self-contained function:
```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    """
    Evaluates an algebraic expression built from the given operator and operand.
    """
    # Ensure proper lengths of operator and operand
    assert len(operator) == len(operand) - 1, "Operator and operand lengths must match."
    
    # Algorithm
    result = 0
    for i in range(len(operand) - 1):
        result += operand[i]
        for j in range(len(operator)):
            if operator[j] == '+':
                result += operand[i + 1]
            elif operator[j] == '-':
                result -= operand[i + 1]
            elif operator[j] == '*':
                result *= operand[i + 1]
            elif operator[j] == '**':
                result **= operand[i + 1]
            elif operator[j] == '/':
                if operand[i + 1] == 0:
                    raise ZeroDivisionError("Floor division by zero is not allowed.")
                result //= operand[i + 1]
    return result
```

This script defines a function `do_algebra` that takes in two arguments, `operator` and `operand`, and returns the result of the algebraic expression formed using the given operands and operators. The function uses Python's built-in `assert` statement to verify the length of the `operator` list against the length of the `operand` list, as stipulated by the problem statement. It then uses nested loops to iterate over the elements of both `operator` and `operand`, applying the various algebraic operations as specified by the problem statement.

Remember to consider the inherent complexity of the algorithm and the restrictions provided in the problem statement when determining efficiency. The code above is a simple application of the supplied function and adheres to the test cases provided in the problem statement.
