Here's a Python script that solves the problem you've outlined using a function with the specified constraints:
```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    result = 0
    oper_len = len(operator)
    for i in range(oper_len):
        result += operator[i] * operand[i]
    return result
```
This code defines a function `do_algebra` that takes in two arguments, `operator` and `operand`, and calculates the result of the algebraic expression formed from the provided operator and operand. 

The function iterates over the lengths of `operator` and `operand`, and applies the corresponding operator to multiply the respective elements in `operand` to arrive at the result of the expression. The result is then returned as the output of the function.

This code is self-contained and can be run as a standalone Python script, and will produce the desired result given the specified lists for `operator` and `operand`. 

Please note that this code assumes that the lists `operator` and `operand` are already preprocessed and sanitized, ensuring they contain only the specified operations and non-negative integers, respectively.
