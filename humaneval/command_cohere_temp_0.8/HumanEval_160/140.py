Here's a Python script that solves the problem you've outlined using a function with the specified constraints:
```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    result = 0
    oper_len = len(operator)
    for i in range(oper_len):
        result += operand[i] * operator[i]
    return result
```
This script uses a for loop to iterate through each element in the `operator` list and performs the designated operation with the corresponding element in the `operand` list. The result is summed together to provide the final result of the algebraic expression.

To use this code, you can test it against the example provided in the prompt, as well as the provided tests:
```python
test_cases = [
    ([['+', '*', '-'], [2, 3, 4, 5]], 9),
    ([['-', '*', '+'], [3, 2, 5, 1]], 6),
    ([['*', '+', '-'], [1, 4, 2, 5]], 29),
    ([['**', '+', '-'], [2, 3, 4, 5]], 625)
]

for test in test_cases:
    result = do_algebra(*test[0])
    assert result == test[1]
```
This will ensure that the script performs correctly for a variety of test cases, with different combinations of operations and operands. 
It's important to note that the code assumes that the lengths of both the `operator` and `operand` lists are such that the expression is valid, as stated in the problem. This is both a robustness and a correctness assumption that must be made given the constraints stated in the prompt.
