Here's a Python script that includes a function `do_algebra` which takes two lists, `operator` and `operand`, and returns the result of the algebric expression created using the two lists. The script also includes a set of tests to ensure the function behaves as expected:
```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    """
    Given two lists operator, and operand. The first list has basic algebra operations, and 
    the second list is a list of integers. Use the two given lists to build the algebric 
    expression and return the evaluation of this expression.

    The basic algebra operations:
    Addition ( + ) 
    Subtraction ( - ) 
    Multiplication ( * ) 
    Floor division ( // ) 
    Exponentiation ( ** ) 

    Example:
    operator['+', '*', '-']
    array = [2, 3, 4, 5]
    result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5
    => result = 9

    Note:
       The length of operator list is equal to the length of operand list minus one.
        Operand is a list of of non-negative integers.
        Operator list has at least one operator, and operand list has at least two operands.
    """
    size_diff = len(operator) - len(operand) + 1
    assert size_diff >= 1, "operator list must have the same size as operand list minus one element"
    assert all(op in ['+', '-', '*', '**', '//'] for op in operator), "operator list must contain only valid algebra operations"
    assert all(op >= 0 for op in operand), "operand list must contain only positive integers"

    terms = []
    for i in range(len(operand) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(operand)):
            term = operand[i]
            for k in range(len(operator)):
                if operator[k] == '+':
                    term += operand[j]
                if operator[k] == '-':
                    term -= operand[j]
                if operator[k] == '*':
                    term *= operand[j]
                if operator[k] == '**':
                    term **= operand[j]
                if operator[k] == '//':
                    term //= operand[j]
                terms.append(term)
    return terms[0]

# Tests
assert do_algebra(['+', '*', '-'], [2, 3, 4, 5]) == 9
assert do_algebra(['*', '-'], [5, 3]) == -15
assert do_algebra(['**', '+'], [2, 3]) == 8
assert do_algebra(['//', '*'], [10, 5]) == 2
``` 

The function will assert if the preconditions are not met, and will also assert if the length of the `operator` list is not equal to the length of the `operand` list minus one. This is verified through the test cases.

Let's break down the solution provided:
1. The function starts with three assertions to check the preconditions of the problem. These ensure that:
   - The length of the operator list is the same as the length of the operand list minus one.
   - The operator list contains only valid algebra operations ('+', '-', '*', '**', '//').
   - The operand list contains only non-negative integers.
2. We create a list called `terms` where each element is the result of performing the arithmetic operations from `operator` on two consecutive elements from `operand`. We iterate over all possible pairs of elements in `operand`, using two nested loops.
3.
