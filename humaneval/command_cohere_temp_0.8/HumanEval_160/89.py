Here's a Python script that solves the problem you've outlined using a function called `do_algebra`:
```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    result = 0
    oper_len = len(operator)
    for i in range(oper_len):
        result += operand[i] * operator[i]
    return result
```
This script defines a function called `do_algebra` that takes in two arguments, `operator` and `operand`. The function returns the result of the algebraic expression formed using the two input lists. 

Let's break down the code:
- The function `do_algebra` is defined with two parameters, `operator` and `operand`. 
- A variable `result` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the result of the expression.
- The length of the `operator` list is stored in the variable `oper_len`. This is used as a loop index to iterate through the elements of `operator` and `operand`.
- The `for` loop iterates across the elements of `operator` and `operand` lists. And the value of `operand[i]` is multiplied  by `operator[i]` and the result is accumulated in the `result` variable. 
- Finally, the function returns the calculated `result`. 

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem based on the assumption that the length of the `operator` list is the same as the length of the `operand` list minus one, and that both lists have at least one element. Also, that the `operand` list contains only non-negative integers. 

However, if you have a large dataset, consider validating the inputs before processing to ensure they meet the required criteria for this algorithm to work effectively. H here's an example of how you can add input validation:
```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    if len(operator) != len(operand) - 1 or len(operand) < 2 or not all(isinstance(x, int) for x in operand) or not all(x in ['+', '-', '*', '//', '**'] for x in operator):
        raise ValueError("Invalid input format")
    result = 0
    oper_len = len(operator)
    for i in range(oper_len):
        result += operand[i] * operator[i]
    return result
```

This version of the function checks if:
- The length of `operator` matches the length of `operand` minus 1.
- The length of `operand` is at least 2.
- All elements in `operand` are integers.
- All characters in `operator` are one of the valid operators.

If any of these checks fail, it raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate message.
