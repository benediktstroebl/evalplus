Here's a Python script that solves the problem you've outlined, along with a markdown code block showing the complete script:
```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    """
    Evaluate an algebraic expression using predefined operators and a list of operands.

    Args:
        operator (list): List of strings representing algebraic operations, such as '+', '-', '*', '/', '**'.
        operand (list): List of integers serving as the operands for the operations.

    Returns:
        int: Result of the evaluated algebraic expression based on the given operator and operand.

    Example:
        >>> do_algebra(['+', '*', '-'], [2, 3, 4, 5])
        9
    """
    # Ensure the lengths of operator and operand are consistent
    if len(operator) != len(operand) - 1:
        raise ValueError("Operator list length must match operand list length minus one.")

    # Iteratively build the expression and evaluate
    expression = ""
    for i in range(len(operand) - 1):
        expression += f"{operand[i]}"
        expression += f" {operator[i]}"
        if i != len(operand) - 2:
            expression += " "

    return eval(expression)

# Test the do_algebra function
def test_do_algebra():
    # Valid operator and operand lists
    assert do_algebra(['+', '*', '-'], [2, 3, 4, 5]) == 9
    assert do_algebra(['-', '/'], [5, 2]) == 2.5

    # Invalid cases
    try:
        do_algebra([], [2, 3, 4, 5])
        assert False, "Should have raised ValueError"
    except ValueError:
        pass

    try:
        do_algebra(['+', '*', '-'], [])
        assert False, "Should have raised ValueError"
    except ValueError:
        pass

    try:
        do_algebra(['+', '*', '-', '^'], [2, 3, 4, 5])
        assert False, "Should have raised ValueError"
    except ValueError:
        pass

    # Ensure the expression is properly constructed and evaluated
    expression = "2 + 3 * 4 - 5"
    assert eval(expression) == 9

# Run the tests
test_do_algebra()
```

Make sure you install the required dependencies, as the script above relies on Python's built-in `eval()` function, which allows code execution. Keep in mind that directly executing user-supplied code can lead to security risks, and such approaches should only be used when the inputs are trusted or validated. 

The `do_algebra` function accepts lists for operators and operands, then constructs and evaluates a mathematical expression. It validates the inputs to ensure they meet the described conditions and handles some edge cases. The `test_do_algebra` function runs a basic set of tests to validate the function's behavior.
