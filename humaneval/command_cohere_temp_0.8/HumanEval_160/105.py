Here's a Python script that solves the problem with a self-contained function:
```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    result = 0
    # Calculate the length of the shorter list to subtract from the length of the longer list
    len_diff = min(len(operator), len(operand)) - 1
    for i in range(len_diff):
        result += operator[i] * operand[i]
    result += operand[-1]
    return result
```
This script takes two inputs `operator` and `operand` as lists. It calculates the difference between the lengths of the two lists and uses it as a loop increment. In each iteration, it performs the corresponding operation and updates the result accordingly. Finally, it returns the computed result. 

Let's say we have the following operator list `'['+', '*', '-']'` and operand list `[2, 3, 4, 5]` and we pass them to `do_algebra()`. Here's how it works:
- The length difference is 1 (the shorter length of the list compared to '['+', '*', '-']').
- So we loop one time and do the following operations:
  - exponentiation: `result = result + 2 ** 3 = result + 8`  (2 raised to the power of 3 is 8)
  - multiplication: `result = result + 3 * 4 = result + 12`  (3 multiplied by 4 is 12)
- In the end, we perform the last operation, subtraction: `result + 5 = result + 5`. 

And the result will be `result + 5 = 12 + 5 = 17`. Thus, the evaluated expression is equal to 17. 

This approach avoids any assumptions or nested loops and should work for any input lists. I hope this helps, let me know if you have any questions!
