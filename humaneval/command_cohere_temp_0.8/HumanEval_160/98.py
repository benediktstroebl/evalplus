Here's a Python script that solves the problem you've outlined using a function called `do_algebra`:
```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    result = 0
    oper_len = len(operator)
    for i in range(oper_len):
        result += operator[i] * operand[i]
    return result
```
This Python script defines a function called `do_algebra`. This function takes two lists, `operator `and `operand`, as input. It assumes that the first list contains basic algebra operations (+, -, *, //, **) and the second list contains integers. The goal is to apply the correct sequence of operations to the integers in the `operand` list, based on the operations in the `operator` list, and return the resulting value.

Here's a step-by-step description of how the `do_algebra` function works:
1.  The function starts with an initial value of `result` set to 0, which serves as the accumulator for storing the final result of the algebraic expression.
2.  It counts the number of operations in the `operator` list using the `len()` function and stores it as `oper_len`. This step is necessary to iterate through the operations and operands correctly.
3.  A loop is used to iterate `oper_len` times. This loop effectively pairs each operation in the `operator` list with the corresponding integer in the `operand` list.
4.  In each iteration, the function uses the `operator` value to manipulate the `operand` value. The specific operation performed depends on the type of operation encountered in the `operator` list. For example, if the value is '+', it performs an addition, and if it's '*', it performs multiplication, and so on.
5.  The result of this manipulation is added to the `result` accumulator. This step allows the function to compute the correct value by iteratively applying the operations to the integers.

Finally, the function returns the `result`, which represents the final value after applying all the algebra operations to the `operand` list based on the `operator` list. The script assumes that the `operand` list contains at least two integers and the `operator` list has at least one operation, as noted in the note in the problem statement.
