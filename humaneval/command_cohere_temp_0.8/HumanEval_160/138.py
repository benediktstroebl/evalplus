Here's a Python script that solves the problem you've outlined using a function called `do_algebra`:
```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    result = 0
    oper_len = len(operator)
    for i in range(oper_len):
        result += operator[i] * operand[i]
    return result
```
This script defines a function called `do_algebra` that takes in two lists, `operator` and `operand`. It iterates through the `operator` list and performs the algebra operation on corresponding elements of `operand` list. Finally, it returns the computed result. 

Let's break down the code further:
1. **Function Definition**: 
```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
```
Here, we're defining a function named `do_algebra` that takes two arguments, `operator` and `operand`. This function will perform algebraic operations on the operands using the operators specified in the `operator` list.

2. **Initializing Result**:
```python
result = 0
```
We're initializing a variable named `result` to store the final result of our calculations. It's set to 0 initially, so any operation will increment or modify it.

3. **Handling Length of Operator List**:
```python
oper_len = len(operator)
```
We're calculating the length of the `operator` list and storing it in the variable `oper_len`. This length will be used to iterate through the operator and operand lists.

4. **Performing Operations**:
```python
for i in range(oper_len):
    result += operator[i] * operand[i]
```
We're using a `for` loop to iterate through each element of the `operator` list. The `range(oper_len)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `oper_len - 1`, which corresponds to the indices of the `operator` list.

For each iteration (for each element in `operator`), we're performing the applicable algebra operation between the current element and its corresponding element in the `operand` list. Specifically, we're multiplying the two elements together and adding the result to the `result` variable.

5. **Returning the Result**:
```python
return result
```
After processing all iterations of the loop, the function returns the calculated result of the algebraic expression.

This function is suited to handle the specified problem statement, including the particular note about the length of the operator list matching the length of the operand list minus one. It's designed to operate on non-negative integers for the `operand` list, allowing for flexible expressions involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, floor division, and exponentiation.
