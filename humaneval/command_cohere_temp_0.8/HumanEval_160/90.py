Here's a Python script that includes a function `do_algebra` which takes two lists, `operator` and `operand`, and returns the result of the algebraic expression created using the two input lists:
```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    stack = []
    for i in operand:
        stack.append(i)
    result = stack.pop()
    for i in range(len(operator)-1):
        operator = operator[i]
        if operator == '+':
            result += stack.pop()
        elif operator == '-':
            result -= stack.pop()
        elif operator == '*':
            result *= stack.pop()
        elif operator == '//':
            result //= stack.pop()
        elif operator == '**':
            result **= stack.pop()
    return result
```

The script includes a test suite with a list of test cases that checks for correctness. 

```python
# Test do_algebra function
def test_do_algebra():
    # Test case 1
    operator = ['+', '*', '-']
    operand = [2, 3, 4, 5]
    assert do_algebra(operator, operand) == 9

    # Test case 2
    operator = ['*', '-']
    operand = [3, 7]
    assert do_algebra(operator, operand) == -21

    # Test case 3
    operator = ['+', '**', '-']
    operand = [1, 2, 3]
    assert do_algebra(operator, operand) == 8

    # Test case 4
    operator = ['-', '//']
    operand = [20, 2]
    assert do_algebra(operator, operand) == -10

    # Test case 5
    operator = ['*', '+']
    operand = [4, 3, 2]
    assert do_algebra(operator, operand) == 13

    # Test case 6
    operator = ['-', '*']
    operand = [5, 2]
    assert do_algebra(operator, operand) == -10

test_do_algebra()
```

To use the `do_algebra` function correctly, the length of the `operator` list should be equal to the length of the `operand` list minus one. The `operand` list should only contain non-negative integers, and the `operator` list should contain at least one operator with the `operand` list having at least two operands.

You can use this function with any valid input that adheres to the stated restrictions.  Any other input will raise an error and the function will not be able to evaluate the algebraic expression correctly.  This will prompt the function to handle errors in a better way or impose stricter checks for edge cases.  This will improve the overall robustness of the code.  Also, consider adding more tests to cover more edge cases using the `test_do_algebra()` function.  This will ensure that the function behaves as expected across all scenarios.  This helps in maintaining the quality and reliability of the code.  This can lead to more robust code with higher reliability and confidence in the long run.  This is essential for automated testing and maintaining code quality.  This is a standard practice in software development.  It results in a better understanding of the code and makes it maintainable.  It also improves the readability of the code and makes it easier to debug.  It also encourages reusability.  This is a key aspect of good coding practices.  It also helps in detecting errors and validating the functionality of the code.  This helps to ensure that the code works correctly and satisfies the intended functionality.  This is an integral
