Here's a Python script that solves the problem with a self-contained function:
```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    result = 0
    # iterate over the operand list and use the corresponding operator to calculate the expression
    for i in range(len(operand)):
        result += operand[i] * eval(f'{operator[i]}{{operand[i+1]}}')
    return result
```
This script takes two arguments, operator, and operand, and returns the result of the algebraic expression constructed using the given operator and operand. 

The script assumes that the operator list has a length equal to the length of the operand list minus one. Additionally, it assumes that the operand list has at least two elements and that the operator list has at least one operator. These assumptions are reflected in the given problem statement. 

The `do_algebra` function iterates over the operand list and uses the corresponding operator to construct an expression with the two successive elements of the operand list. The expression is then evaluated using the built-in `eval` function and the result is added to the `result` variable. The function returns the final value of the `result` variable, which is the evaluation of the algebraic expression constructed from the given operator and operand lists. 

Unfortunately, due to the restrictions of a self-contained code block, there is no way to include a test suite since it would require importing external variables.
