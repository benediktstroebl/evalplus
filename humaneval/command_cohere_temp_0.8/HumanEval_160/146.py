Here's a Python script that solves the problem you've outlined using a self-contained function:
```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    assert len(operator) == len(operand) - 1, "Operator list length must be equal to operand list length - 1"
    assert len(operator) > 0 and len(operand) > 1, "Operator list must have at least one element and operand list must have at least two elements"
    
    result = 0
    for i in range(len(operand) - 1):
        result += operator[i] * operand[i+1]
    
    return result
```

This script defines a function `do_algebra` that takes two arguments, `operator` and `operand`, and returns the result of the algebraic expression created using the given operator and operand. The script includes assertions that ensure the input lists have the required properties as mentioned in the prompt. Finally, it loops through the valid indices of the `operand` list and appropriately multiplies elements with corresponding operators, subsequently adding the resultant values to the final outcome. 

Let's break down the code:
1. `assert len(operator) == len(operand) - 1, "Operator list length must be equal to operand list length - 1":` This assertion checks whether the length of the `operator` list is equal to the length of the `operand` list minus one. This is required by the problem statement.
2. `assert len(operator) > 0 and len(operand) > 1, "Operator list must have at least one element and operand list must have at least two elements":` This assertion checks whether both the `operator` and `operand` lists are of substantial length, upholding the prerequisite of having at least one operator and two operands present.
3. `result = 0: `This initializes a variable `result` to 0, where all the calculations will be added.
4. `for i in range(len(operand) - 1):` This loop iterates over the valid indices of the `operand` list, excluding the last element (as it requires an operator to process it).
5. `result += operator[i] * operand[i+1]:` Within the loop, this snippet of code multiplies the `i`th operator with the subsequent (`i + 1`)th operand on the list, casting the result to be added to the `result` variable.
6. `return result: ` Finally, the function returns the calculated result. 

The code upholds the given constraints, efficiently performs the desired calculations, and outputly yields the resultant value. 

This code can be placed in a test suite and can easily be modified to accommodate more advanced algebraic operations or other list compositions to evaluate a wider range of expressions.
