Here's a Python script that solves the problem with a self-contained function:
```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    result = 0
    # Calculate the length of the shorter list to subtract it from the length of the longer list
    length_to_sub = min(len(operator), len(operand)) - 1
    for i in range(length_to_sub):
        result += operand[i]  # Add the operand to the result
        operator = operator[i] + operator[0]  # Concatenate the current operator with the next operator
    result += int(operator)  # Add the last operator as an integer to the result
    return result
```

This script defines a function `do_algebra` that takes two lists, `operator` and `operand`, as input. It considers the first list, `operator`, as a sequence of binary operators and the second list, `operand`, as a sequence of operands for the operators. 

The function iterates through the lists, but since the length of `operator` list is expected to be shorter than the length of `operand` list, it only loops through the length of the shorter list. During each iteration, it concatenates the current operator with the next operator in the sequence, essentially building a string of operators. It then adds the corresponding operand to the result and finally, it adds the last operator (which is assumed to be a literal integer) to the result. 

Before returning the evaluated expression, the function verifies that the length of `operator` list is at least 1 and the length of `operand` list is at least 2 to ensure the input conforms to the Note provided in the prompt. 

This solution assumes that the `operand` list contains only non-negative integers without any additional characters or elements. 

This approach results in a straightforward evaluation of the algebraic expression, as it iteratively processes the lists to construct and calculate the expression.
