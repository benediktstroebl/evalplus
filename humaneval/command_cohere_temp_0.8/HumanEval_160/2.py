Here's a Python script that solves the problem you've outlined, along with a markdown code block showing the complete script:
```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    result = 0
    # Calculate the length of the shorter list to iterate max times
    max_iterations = min(len(operator), len(operand)-1)
    for i in range(max_iterations):
        # For each iteration, perform the operation based on the operator and operands
        result += operand[i] * operator[i]
    # Adjust result based on the last unprocessed operand
    result += operand[-1] * operator[-1]
    return result
```
The Python script defines a function `do_algebra` that takes two lists, `operator` and `operand`, as arguments. This function returns the result of evaluating an algebraic expression constructed from the provided operator and operand lists. It iterates through the lists, with longer lists incrementing through iterations to perform the operations in the algebra expression. The result is computed as it iterates through the shorter list of operations. Finally, it adjusts the result based on the last unprocessed operand and returns the computed result.
