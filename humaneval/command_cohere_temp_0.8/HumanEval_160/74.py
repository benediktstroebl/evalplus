Here's a Python script that solves the problem you've outlined, along with a few example tests to ensure the function works as expected:
```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    result = 0
    # Use loops to create and evaluate the expression
    for op, num in zip(operator, operand):
        if   op == '+': result += num
        elif op == '-': result -= num
        elif op == '*': result *= num
        elif op == '//': result //= num
        elif op == '**': result **= num
    return result

# Tests
assert do_algebra(['+', '*', '-'], [2, 3, 4, 5]) == 9
assert do_algebra(['*', '//', '-'], [4, 2, 100, 5]) == -20
assert do_algebra(['**', '//', '+'], [2, 3, 4, 8]) == 40
assert do_algebra(['+', '-', '*'], [7, 3, 2, 8]) == 5
```
You can add more tests to this list to ensure the function works correctly with a variety of input combinations. Simply create more test cases using the provided syntax and compare the output to the expected result.
