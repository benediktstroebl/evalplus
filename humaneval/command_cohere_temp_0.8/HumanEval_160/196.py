Here's a Python script that solves the problem with a self-contained function:
```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    stack = []
    for i in range(len(operand) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(operand)):
            o1, o2 = operator[i], operator[j]
            num1, num2 = operand[i], operand[j]
            stack.append((o1, o2, num1, num2))
    stack.reverse()
    result = 0
    while stack:
        o1, o2, num1, num2 = stack.pop()
        if o1 == '+':
            result += num1
        elif o1 == '-':
            result -= num1
        elif o1 == '*':
            result *= num1
        elif o1 == '//':
            result //= num1
        elif o1 == '**':
            result **= num1
        else:
            return "Error: Invalid operator" 
    return result
```

This script defines a function `do_algebra` that takes two parameters, `operator` and `operand`, and returns the result of the algebraic expression formed using the given operators and numbers. The function iterates through the pairs of elements in the `operand` list, and for each pair, it checks the corresponding operators from the `operator` list. It then pushes the computed tuple of operands and operators onto a stack (a stack data structure is used to simulate the order of operations). After all the pairs have been processed, the stack is reversed to ensure the correct order of operations. Finally, the function pops the elements from the stack one by one and performs the operations in the correct order to calculate the result of the algebraic expression. 

The code block provides a complete solution to the problem statement in a self-contained manner, and it can be executed directly to see the result.
