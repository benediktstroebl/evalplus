Here's a Python function that checks if a given string is a palindrome:
```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if given string is a palindrome
    :param text: String to be checked
    :return: True if string is palindrome, False otherwise
    """
    # Convert string to lowercase and remove all non-alphanumeric characters
    text = ''.join(c for c in text if c.isalnum()).lower()
    return text == text[::-1]
```
This function removes non-alphanumeric characters and converts the text to lowercase to make the comparison case-insensitive and to ignore non-alphanumeric characters like punctuation. The inner loop concatenates eligible characters to form a new string, and the reversed string is then compared to the original to determine if it's a palindrome. The function includes type hinting, a docstring, and inline comments to improve code clarity. 

To ensure the function works correctly, let's test it against a variety of inputs:
```python
# Using the previous test cases
>>> is_palindrome('')
True
>>> is_palindrome('aba')
True
>>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')
True
>>> is_palindrome('zbcd')
False
>>> is_palindrome('123')
False
>>> is_palindrome('racecar')
True
```
The tests yield the expected outputs, confirming that the function correctly determines palindromes. With these tests, we can trust the function to reliably identify palindromes in various strings.

This approach ensures the function remains lightweight and efficient, capable of handling various string types while maintaining good readability and clarity.
