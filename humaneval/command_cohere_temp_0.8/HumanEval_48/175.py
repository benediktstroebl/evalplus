Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of checking if a given string is a palindrome:
```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a given string is a palindrome.
    """
    # Convert string to lowercase and remove all non-alphanumeric characters
    text = ''.join(c for c in text if c.isalnum()).lower()
    
    # Check if the reversed string matches the original string
    return text == text[::-1]
```
This function uses a few tricks to make the palindrome checking process more efficient:
1. It converts the input string to lowercase, which ensures that the check isn't case-sensitive.
2. It removes all non-alphanumeric characters from the string, allowing the function to focus only on the characters that are relevant for determining if it's a palindrome.
3. It uses slicing to reverse the string without having to use the reversed function, making the code more efficient.

This approach ensures that the function remains self-contained while providing a concise and efficient solution to the problem.
