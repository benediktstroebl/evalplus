```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a given string is a palindrome.
    """
    # Convert string to list to allow index-based traversal
    text = list(text)
    # Traverse the list from both ends towards the middle
    for i in range(len(text) // 2):
        # If characters at corresponding positions are not equal, it's not a palindrome
        if text[i] != text[-1-i]:
            return False
    return True
```

This function uses two important techniques:
1. The string is converted into a list to allow index-based traversal, especially useful for corner cases like the empty string.
2. The list is traversed from both ends towards the middle. This is crucial for efficiency since the maximum number of iterations is always half the length of the string, irrespective of the string's length.

These techniques ensure the function is efficient and works correctly for all cases, including edge cases like the empty string or strings with very large lengths.
