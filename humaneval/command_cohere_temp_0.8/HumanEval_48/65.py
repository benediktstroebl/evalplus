```python
def is_palindrome(text: str):
    """
    Checks if given string is a palindrome
    :param text: string to be checked
    :return: boolean
    """
    # Convert string to list to allow iterating through reversed text
    text_list = list(text)
    # Compare each character of text with reversed char at same index
    for i in range(len(text)):
        if text_list[i] != text_list[~i]:  # Use ~i to get index of reversed order
            return False
    return True
```

This function uses two lines of interest:
- The string is converted into a list to allow easy iteration through the reversed text.
- The function compares each character of text with its reversed counterpart at the same index. If a mismatch is found, the function returns False, indicating that the text is not a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns True.

This solution is efficient and easy to understand. It does not require any additional libraries and can be easily copied and ran as it is self-contained. It is also compact enough to be easily transferable should you want to include it in a larger project. 

You can use this function by calling it and passing a string as an argument. It will then return either True or False depending on if the string is a palindrome or not. 

For example:
```python
>> is_palindrome('')
True
>> is_palindrome('aba')
True
>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')
True
>> is_palindrome('zbcd')
False
```

This will output:
- True
- True
- True
- False

As expected, the function correctly identifies the empty string, 'aba', 'aaaaa' as palindromes and 'zbcd' as not. 

This function is an example of a good modular and reusable implementation, as it is self-contained and has an informative docstring that clearly explains its behavior and usage.
