Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of checking if a given string is a palindrome:
```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a given string is a palindrome.
    """
    # Convert string to lowercase and remove all non-alphanumeric characters
    text = ''.join(c for c in text if c.isalnum()).lower()
    
    # Check if the reversed string matches the original
    return text == text[::-1]
```
This function leverages these steps to determine palindrome:
1. Remove all non-alphanumeric characters, leveraging the `c.isalnum()` condition to focus on alphabetic and numeric characters.
2. Convert the string to lowercase to ensure an case-insensitive check.
3. Utilize string slicing `text[::-1]` to reverse the string and compare it with the original.

The tests provided in the problem statement yield the following results when applied to this function:
```python
>>> is_palindrome('')
True
>>> is_palindrome('aba')
True
>>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')
True
>>> is_palindrome('zbcd')
False
```
