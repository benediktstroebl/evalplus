Here's a Python function that checks if a given string is a palindrome:
```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if given string is a palindrome
    :param text: String to be checked
    :return: True if string is palindrome, False otherwise
    """
    # Convert string to lowercase and remove all non-alphanumeric characters
    text = ''.join(c for c in text if c.isalnum()).lower()
    
    # Check if text is equal to its reverse
    return text == text[::-1]
```
This function first removes all non-alphanumeric characters and converts the text to lowercase to make the comparison case-insensitive and to ignore punctuation, whitespace, and other non-alphanumeric characters. Then, it compares the cleaned string with its reverse using slicing ([::-1]) to determine if it's a palindrome. The function returns True for palindromes and False otherwise.  It is also covered by the provided tests. 
```python
>>> is_palindrome('')
True
>>> is_palindrome('aba')
True
>>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')
True
>>> is_palindrome('zbcd')
False
```
