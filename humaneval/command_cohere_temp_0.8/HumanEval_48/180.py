Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of checking if a given text is a palindrome:
```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a given string is a palindrome.
    """
    # Split the text into individual characters and reverse the list.
    char_list = list(text)
    reversed_char_list = char_list[::-1]
    
    # Compare the original text with its reverse to check for palindrome
    return text == ''.join(reversed_char_list)
```

This function leverages list manipulation and string concatenation to determine if a given string is a palindrome. The tests provided in the original prompt confirm the correctness of this function. You can use it by calling `is_palindrome()` with any string input.
