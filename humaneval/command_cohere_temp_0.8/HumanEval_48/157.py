    Checks if a given string is a palindrome.

The provided Python script defines a function named `is_palindrome(text: str)`. This function evaluates whether a given text is a palindrome, which is a sequence that reads the same forwards and backwards. The method for determining a palindrome is to simply reverse the string and compare it to the original, which is demonstrated in the code. If the text and its reverse are identical, the function returns `True`, indicating a palindrome; otherwise, it returns `False`. Using this method, you can efficiently determine whether any given text is a palindrome.
