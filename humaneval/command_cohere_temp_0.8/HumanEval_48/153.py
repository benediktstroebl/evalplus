Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of checking if a given string is a palindrome:
```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a given string is a palindrome.
    
    Args:
        text (str): Text to be checked.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the text is a palindrome, False otherwise.
    """
    # Convert text to lowercase and remove all non-alphanumeric characters
    text = ''.join(c for c in text if c.isalnum()).lower()
    
    # Check if the reversed text matches the original text
    return text == text[::-1]
```
This function uses a few tricks to make the palindrome checking process more efficient:
1. It converts the input text to lowercase, which ensures that the checking process ignores case distinctions.
2. It removes all non-alphanumeric characters from the text using a list comprehension. This excludes spaces, punctuation, and other non-alphanumeric characters from the checking process.
3. It uses slicing to reverse the text without using the `reversed` function, which can be more efficient for large strings.

The function passes the tests provided in the original problem description. You can test it with other scenarios as well:
```python
# Test the function
print(is_palindrome(''))  # Output: True
print(is_palindrome('aba'))  # Output: True
print(is_palindrome('aaaaa'))  # Output: True
print(is_palindrome('zbcd'))  # Output: False
```

This function provides a straightforward and effective way to check whether a given string is a palindrome.
