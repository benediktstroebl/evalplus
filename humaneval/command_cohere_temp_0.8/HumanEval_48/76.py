Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of checking if a given text is a palindrome:
```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a given string is a palindrome.
    
    Args:
        text (str): Text to be checked.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the text is a palindrome, False otherwise.
    """
    # Convert text to lowercase and remove all non-alphanumeric characters
    text = ''.join(c for c in text if c.isalnum()).lower()
    
    # Check if the reversed text matches the original text
    return text == text[::-1]
```
This function uses a few efficient steps to determine if a string is a palindrome:
1. It removes all non-alphanumeric characters from the input text using a generator expression and a join function.
2. It converts the text to lowercase to make the check case-insensitive.
3. It compares the original text with its reverse using slicing to efficiently reverse the string.

The tests included demonstrate the function's behavior and its ability to identify palindromes correctly. You can use this function as a standalone solution for checking palindromes in your text. 
```python
# Tests:
>>> is_palindrome('')
True
>>> is_palindrome('aba')
True
>>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')
True
>>> is_palindrome('zbcd')
False
``` 
This code snippet provides an improved accuracy in identifying palindromes. Feel free to customize it according to your needs.
