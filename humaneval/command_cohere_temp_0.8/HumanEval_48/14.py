```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a given string is a palindrome.
    """
    # Convert string to lowercase and remove all non-alphanumeric characters
    text = ''.join(c for c in text if c.isalnum()).lower()
    
    # Check if the reversed string matches the original string
    return text == text[::-1]
```

This function leverages string manipulation and the slice notation to check if a given string is a palindrome. It removes all non-alphanumeric characters and converts the text to lowercase to handle cases such as `Aba` not being considered a palindrome during the character-checking process. The function's succinct nature makes it both efficient and easy to test.
