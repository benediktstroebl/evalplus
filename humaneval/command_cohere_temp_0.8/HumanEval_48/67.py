Here's a Python function that checks if a given string is a palindrome:
```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if given string is a palindrome
    :param text: String to be checked
    :return: True if string is palindrome, False otherwise
    """
    # Convert string to lowercase and remove all non-alphanumeric characters
    text = ''.join(c for c in text if c.isalnum()).lower()
    
    # Check if the reversed string matches the original string
    return text == text[::-1]
```
This function first removes any non-alphanumeric characters and converts the text to lowercase to make the comparison case-insensitive. It then compares the original text with its reverse using slicing to determine if it's a palindrome. The tests provided in the problem statement will return True for 'aba', 'aaaaa', and an empty string, and False for 'zbcd'. 
You can use this function in your code to check if a string is a palindrome. It provides a clear docstring explaining the function's purpose and usage, making it accessible and understandable to users who might interact with it.
