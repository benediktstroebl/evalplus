Here's a Python function that checks if a given text is a palindrome:
```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if given string is a palindrome
    :param text: String to be checked
    :return: True if string is palindrome, False otherwise
    """
    # Convert string to lowercase and remove all non-alphanumeric characters
    text = ''.join(c for c in text if c.isalnum()).lower()
    # Check if text is equal to its reverse
    return text == text[::-1]
```
This code uses a couple of clever tricks to make the palindrome checking process more efficient, these include:
- Conversion to lowercase and removal of non-alphanumeric characters to ensure that the check is case-insensitive and ignores irrelevant characters.
- Use of slicing (text[::-1]) to reverse the string, this is more efficient than using the reverse() method.

The expected behavior of the function is:
```
is_palindrome('') -> True
is_palindrome('aba') -> True
is_palindrome('aaaaa') -> True
is_palindrome('zbcd') -> False
``` 
You can incorporate this function into your code to check if a string is a palindrome. 
If you would like to test it, you can print the result of the function for the given examples and see if it matches the expected behavior. In the provided Markdown code block, add your test sentences under the '>>>' prompt to see the function's evaluation for each input. 
This would look like: 
```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if given string is a palindrome
    >>> is_palindrome('')
    True
    >>> is_palindrome('aba')
    True
    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')
    True
    >>> is_palindrome('zbcd')
    False
    """
``` 
This will help verify that the function behaves as expected.
