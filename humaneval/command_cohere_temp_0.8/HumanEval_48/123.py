Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of checking if a given string is a palindrome:
```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a given string is a palindrome.
    
    Args:
        text (str): Text to be checked.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the text is a palindrome, False otherwise.
    """
    # Convert text to lowercase and remove all non-alphanumeric characters
    text = ''.join(c for c in text if c.isalnum()).lower()
    
    # Check if the reversed text matches the original text
    return text == text[::-1]
```
This function uses a few tricks to make the palindrome checking process more efficient:
1. Removal of non-alphanumeric characters: The function removes all non-alphanumeric characters from the text using a list comprehension. This excludes spaces, punctuation, and other characters that aren't numbers or letters.
2. Conversion to Lowercase: It converts the entire text to lowercase. This step ensures that words are compared case insensitively, "aba" is considered the same as "aBa" and "ABa".
3. Efficient Comparison: The function compares the cleaned text with its reverse using slicing (`text[::-1]`). This is a more efficient way to reverse a string compared to using the `reverse()` method.

The tests included in the initial problem statement are already covered by the function's behavior. The function correctly identifies empty strings, single-character strings, and multi-character palindromes as true, and non-palindromic words as false.

This function is reusable anywhere in Python scripts or projects where you need to verify if a given string is a palindrome.
