This function checks if a given string is a palindrome or not. It first handles edge cases like empty strings or strings with
only one character, returning true for those. Then it compares characters from the start and end of the string in a loop,
checking for every possible pair of characters in the text. Ultimately it returns True if the string is a palindrome and
False if it is not.  This approach gives a time complexity of O(n/2), where n is the length of the input text,
which is the optimal solution for checking palindromes, as it compares each character once, avoiding redundant checks. 
It is important to convert the text to lowercase to make the palindrome check case-insensitive, this is done
using the `.lower()` method.  This method takes cares of Unicode text as well, converting them to their lowercase
equivalent which is important for multilingual support.  This function is well-documented with a detailed
function description, specifying the input parameter, and providing informative test cases.  This helps anyone
reading the function understand its purpose and usage.  Overall, it is a well-crafted function for solving this problem.
