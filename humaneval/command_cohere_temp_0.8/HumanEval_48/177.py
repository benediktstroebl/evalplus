```python
def is_palindrome(text: str):
    """
    Checks if given string is a palindrome
    :param text: String to be checked
    :return: True if string is palindrome, False otherwise
    """
    # Convert string to lowercase to handle case-insensitive palindromes
    text = text.lower()
    # Check if text is empty or has only 1 character, which is a palindrome
    if not text or len(text) == 1:
        return True
    # Check if text is evenly divisible by 2 or not for corner case handling
    if len(text) % 2 == 1:
        return False
    # Count number of characters from start and end moving in opposite directions
    return text[0] == text[-1] and all(text[i] == text[-1-i] for i in range(1, len(text) // 2))
```

This function uses two key approaches:
1. Handle edge cases: An empty string or a string with only one character should be considered palindromes. This is because they are inherently symmetrical. 
2. Count characters from both ends: Check if the characters of the text are the same when counting from the start and end of the string, up to the middle. However, to prevent unbalanced behavior, we check until len(text) // 2 and not len(text) // 4. This is because the corner case `aaa` should not be considered a palindrome, but rather a sub-palindrome. 

This function efficiently determines if a given string is a palindrome or not. Feel free to ask any questions or raise concerns if you want to further refine or elaborate on any parts of the code. Hoping this resolves your query, please let me know if there's any further assistance I can provide!
