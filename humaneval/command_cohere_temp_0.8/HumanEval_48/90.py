```python
def is_palindrome(text: str):
    """
    Checks if a given string is a palindrome.
    """
    # Your code here :)
    if text == text[::-1]:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This function simplifies the problem by directly comparing the input to its reverse to check for a palindrome. The tests provided will yield correct results when applied to this function. Let's break down the solution:
1. The `def is_palindrome(text: str):` declaration creates a function named `is_palindrome` that takes a string text as input.
2. Within the function, `if text == text[::-1]:` compares the input text to its reverse using slicing `text[::-1]`. If they are the same, the function returns True, indicating the input is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns False.

This solution is straightforward and works correctly for all inputs provided in the tests. However, it's worth noting that this approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as it requires creating a reversed copy of the string for comparison.

Feel free to apply this solution to the tests provided to see the results! Let me know if you'd like me to provide additional explanations or insight into any aspect of this code.
