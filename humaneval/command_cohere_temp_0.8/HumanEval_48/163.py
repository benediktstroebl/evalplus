Here's a Python function that checks if a given text is a palindrome:
```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if given string is a palindrome
    :param text: string to be checked
    :return: boolean
    """
    # Convert text to lowercase and remove all non-alphanumeric characters
    text = ''.join(c for c in text if c.isalnum()).lower()
    return text == text[::-1]
```
This function removes all non-alphanumeric characters and converts the text to lowercase to make the comparison case-insensitive and to ignore differences in punctuation, whitespace, and other non-alphanumeric characters. The text is then checked whether it's the same when reading forward and backward (using slicing notation text[::-1] to reverse a string). The function returns True if it's a palindrome and False otherwise. 
The tests provided in the problem statement will return:
```
True
True
True
False
```
Which matches the expected behavior of the provided tests. It is important to note that this approach is case-insensitive, and also ignores non-alphanumeric characters. 
If you wish to treat punctuation and other non-alphanumeric characters as meaningful and consider case sensitivity, you may want to adjust the approach accordingly. 
Let me know if you'd like me to explain any of the steps outlined above! I'll be happy to assist further. This solution eliminates those differences to provide a consistent check for palindromes.
