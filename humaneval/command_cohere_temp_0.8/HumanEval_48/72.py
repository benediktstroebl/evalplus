Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of checking if a given string is a palindrome:
```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a given string is a palindrome.
    """
    # Split the text into individual characters
    text = text.strip()
    return text == text[::-1]
```
This function checks if a given text is a palindrome by comparing the original text with its reverse. If they are the same, the function returns `True`, indicating the text is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Here's an example of using this function:
```python
>>> is_palindrome('')) True
>>> is_palindrome('aba')
True
>>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')
True
>>> is_palindrome('zbcd')
False
```
This demonstrates how the function can be used to check if different strings are palindromes or not. The function includes documentation through the docstring to explain its purpose and usage.
