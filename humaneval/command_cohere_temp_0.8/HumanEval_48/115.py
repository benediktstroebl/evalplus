Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of checking if a given text is a palindrome:
```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a given string is a palindrome.
    """
    # Split the text into individual characters and reverse the list.
    char_list = list(text)
    char_list.reverse()
    # Iterate through the characters of the original text and the reversed text to check if they are the same
    return text == ''.join(char_list)
```
This function leverages Python's string manipulation capabilities and slicing techniques to achieve this in a straightforward manner. It compares characters pairwise, starting from the beginning and end of the string, until it reaches the middle or until it determines the string is not a palindrome. The result is a boolean indicating whether the input text is a palindrome or not.
