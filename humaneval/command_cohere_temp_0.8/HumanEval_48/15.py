Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of checking if a given text is a palindrome:
```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a given string is a palindrome.
    """
    # Convert string to lowercase and remove all non-alphanumeric characters
    text = ''.join(c for c in text if c.isalnum()).lower()
    
    # Check if the reversed text matches the original text
    return text == text[::-1]
```
This function leverages these steps to provide an accurate check for palindromes:
- Removal of non-alphanumeric characters using a list comprehension.
- Conversion to lowercase to accommodate cases like 'Aba'.
- Comparison of the original text with its reverse using slicing.

The tests provided in the initial request prompt show appropriate usage and the expected results demonstrate the function's behavior. 
This function accurately determines whether a given string is a palindrome or not, ensuring efficiency and readability. 

To ensure the function remains robust, remember to handle edge cases such as empty strings or text containing only whitespace. You can further enhance the function to make it more robust and adaptable to various scenarios.
