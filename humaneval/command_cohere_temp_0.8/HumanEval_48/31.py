Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of checking if a given string is a palindrome:
```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a given string is a palindrome.
    
    Args:
        text (str): Text to be checked.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the text is a palindrome, False otherwise.
    """
    # Convert text to lowercase and remove all non-alphanumeric characters
    text = ''.join(c for c in text if c.isalnum()).lower()
    
    # Check if the reversed text matches the original text
    return text == text[::-1]
```
This function uses a few tricks to make the palindrome checking process more efficient:
1. Removal of non-alphanumeric characters: The function removes all non-alphanumeric characters from the input text using a list comprehension. This allows us to ignore spaces, punctuation, and other non-alphanumeric characters while checking for a palindrome.
2. Conversion to lowercase: The function converts the input text to lowercase. This step ensures that the checking process is case-insensitive, ignoring variations in capital and small letters.
3. Efficient palindrome check: The function then checks if the cleaned and lowercase text is equal to its reverse (text[::-1]). The slice text[::-1] creates a reversed copy of the string.

The tests included in the initial prompt correspond to the behaviour of the provided function. You can use the function as a standalone solution for checking palindromes in your applications.
