Here's a Python function that checks if a given text is a palindrome:
```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if given string is a palindrome
    :param text: string to be checked
    :return: True if string is palindrome, False otherwise
    """
    # Convert string to lowercase and remove all non-alphanumeric characters
    text = ''.join(c for c in text if c.isalnum()).lower()
    return text == text[::-1]
```
This function removes all non-alphanumeric characters and converts the text to lowercase to make the comparison case-insensitive and to ignore any punctuation, whitespace, or other non-alphanumeric characters. The inner loop concatenates eligible characters from right to left, and the reversed string is compared to the original text to determine whether it's a palindrome. The function includes type hinting, a docstring, and commentary to improve code clarity.

Here's a test suite to validate the function:
```python
def test_palindrome():
    # Basic Test Cases
    assert is_palindrome('')
    assert is_palindrome('aba')
    assert is_palindrome('aaaaa')

    # Non-Palindrome Test Cases
    assert not is_palindrome('zbcd')

    # Corner Case Test Cases
    assert is_palindrome('hello')
    assert not is_palindrome('racecar')

    # Large Text Test Case
    large_text = 'aaaaaaaab' * 10000
    assert is_palindrome(large_text)
```
This test suite includes several test cases, including edge cases, to ensure the `is_palindrome` function behaves as expected. By incorporating these tests, you can have greater confidence in the accuracy and robustness of the code.
