Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of checking if a given text is a palindrome:
```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a given string is a palindrome.
    
    Args:
        text (str): Text to be checked.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the text is a palindrome, False otherwise.
    """
    # Convert text to lowercase and remove all non-alphanumeric characters
    text = ''.join(c for c in text if c.isalnum()).lower()
    
    # Check if the reversed text matches the original text
    return text == text[::-1]
```
This function uses a few tricks to make the palindrome checking process more efficient:
1. Removes all non-alphanumeric characters from the text, as palindromes can only use alphanumeric characters.
2. Converts the text to lowercase to make the checking case-insensitive.
3. Uses a generator expression to efficiently filter out non-alphanumeric characters without creating a new list.
4. Checks if the reversed text matches the original text, which is the core of the palindrome checking problem.

This function is concise, efficient, and self-contained, and it should work well for various inputs while maintaining readability and elegance. You can use it to check if a given string is a palindrome or not.
