Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of checking if a given text is a palindrome:
```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a given string is a palindrome.
    """
    # Convert string to lowercase and remove all non-alphanumeric characters
    text = ''.join(c for c in text if c.isalnum()).lower()
    
    # Check if the reversed string matches the original string
    return text == text[::-1]
```

This script defines a function `is_palindrome` that takes a string text as input and returns `True` if it is a palindrome (reads the same backwards as forwards), and `False` otherwise. The function first cleans the input by converting it to lowercase and removing all non-alphanumeric characters using a list comprehension. Then it checks if the cleaned string is equal to its reverse, using slicing notation `s[::-1]` which is a more pythonic way to reverse a string. The function is designed to be self-contained and easy to use, as it does not rely on any external variables or assumptions. 

To apply this function to test cases, you can simply call it with different input strings like this:
```python
# Test Cases
assert is_palindrome('')
assert is_palindrome('aba')
assert is_palindrome('aaaaa')
assert not is_palindrome('zbcd')
```

This will verify the correct behavior of the `is_palindrome` function for different inputs.
