```python
def get_row(lst, x):
    result = []
    for i, row in enumerate(lst):
        if x in row:
            result.append((i, row.index(x)))
    result.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    result.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    return result
```

The `get_row` function iterates through each row in the list `lst`, and for each row, it checks if the integer `x` is present in the row. If it is, the function constructs a tuple (`i`, `index`) where `i` is the row index and `index` is the column index of `x` in the row. These tuples are then appended to the `result` list.

Before returning the list of tuples, we sort the list first by the row index (`i`) in ascending order and then by the column index (`index`) in ascending order. This ensures that the output list is sorted by row and within each row by column. 

The provided example usages and test cases in the markdown code block are also included in the script to verify the correct behavior of the function. You can use them to test the correctness of the provided solution.
