```python
def get_row(matrix, x):
    result = []
    for row in matrix:
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val == x:
                result.append((row_idx + 1, col_idx + 1))
                break
        row_idx += 1
    result.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    result.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return result
```

The nested list, `matrix`, is iterated through row by row. Within each row, the list is traversed element by iteration, and the value `x` is searched for within each element. If `x` is found, a tuple containing the current row index and column index is appended to the `result` list. This process is repeated for each row in the matrix.

After constructing the list of tuples, we sort them first in ascending order of rows and then in descending order of columns, achieving the desired order of coordinates. The final sorted list of tuples is returned. 

This approach ensures that the search for `x` within each list is efficient, with minimal code and time complexity. It also guarantees the correct ordering of the coordinates according to the problem statement.  By utilizing a nested for loop, we efficiently traverse the nested list structure.
