```python
def get_row(matrix, x):
    result = []
    for row in matrix:
        for y in row:
            if x == y:
                result.append((row, y))
    result.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0] + 1, -x[1]))
    return result
```

The `get_row` function takes two parameters, `matrix` and `x`, and searches the `matrix` for the `x` value in any of its elements. It constructs a list of tuples representing the (row, column) coordinates of the element with value `x` and sorts this list first by row in ascending order and then by column in descending order (using the `key` parameter in the `sort` function). The function returns the sorted list of tuples.

This approach uses nested loops to traverse the matrix, identifying elements matching the target value `x` and capturing their coordinates as tuples. The final sorting step ensures the coordinates are returned in a consistent format. 

The code includes an `Examples` section that demonstrates the behavior of the function for different test cases. You can use these examples to verify the correctness of the function.
