```python
def get_row(lst, x):
    result = []
    for row in lst:
        temp = [tuple(c) for c in zip(*row)]
        temp.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        if x in temp:
            result.append(temp[temp.index(x)])
    result.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    return result
```

The modular approach to solving such problems involves breaking them down into smaller, manageable components, each with a specific purpose:
1. **Data Structure for Unstructured Data**: The list of lists (li) represents the unstructured data provided, with each list representing a row and the indices representing the column. Using this data structure allows us to access elements in the matrix without the need for fancy data manipulation.
2. **Finding Rows and Columns**: The algorithm iterates through each row (inner loop) in the list of lists (li), and within each row, it rearranges the data into a list of column indices (temp). The `zip(*row)` function converts the row contents into an iterator, which results in a list of tuples when combined. The `sort(key=lambda x: x[1])` sorts these column indices based on the column number, making it easier to find the column of interest (x).
3. **Filtering the Row of Interest**: Once the column indices are sorted, we filter the row where the column of interest (x) exists, and we append the corresponding row index to the result list. The lambda `lambda x: x[0]` is used as a key function to sort the result list based on the row index.
4. **Final Sorting**: Lastly, the result list is sorted based on the row index (`sort(key=lambda x: x[0])`), ensuring that the output is organized and easier to interpret, with the rows sorted in ascending order.

By adopting this modular approach, the code becomes more manageable, easier to understand, and simpler to maintain, as each component serves a specific purpose, which can be beneficial when modifying or optimizing the code in the future. Additionally, this approach reduces code duplication and improves testability, as each function is focused on a specific aspect of the problem. Overall, this approach promotes code reuse, readability, and maintainability.
