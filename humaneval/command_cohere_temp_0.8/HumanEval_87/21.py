```python
def get_row(matrix, x):
    result = []
    for i, row in enumerate(matrix):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val == x:
                result.append((i, j))
    result.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    return result
```

The nested list, `matrix`, is iterated through row by row. Within each row, the value `x` is searched for in the column, and the pair `((row index), (column index))` is appended to the `result` list. Before the list is returned, the sorting procedure is applied, first by row in ascending order and then by column in descending order, the latter making the output list uniform along the row. 

The code includes a `mock_matrix` variable that can be edited for testing variations of the input format.

```python
def test_get_row():
    mock_matrix = [
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6],
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1],
    ]
    
    assert get_row(mock_matrix, 1) == [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]
    assert get_row(mock_matrix, 5) == [(2, 1)]
    assert get_row(mock_matrix, 7) == []
    assert get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3) == [(2, 2)]
    assert get_row(mock_matrix, 0) == []
``` 

This way, the function is independently executable and can handle various inputs.
