```python
def get_row(matrix, x):
    result = []
    for row in matrix:
        for y in row:
            if x == y:
                result.append((row, y))
    result.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0] + 1, -x[1]))
    return result
```

The code iterates through each list in the given `matrix` (treated as rows) and finds the positions of the integer `x`. It then sorts these positions based on the row number (`row[0] + 1`) in ascending order and the column number (`-row[1]`) in descending order to return the list of tuples. The tests provided in the prompt are also included in the code to ensure its functionality. 
The complete answering code is:
```python
def get_row(matrix, x):
    result = []
    for row in matrix:
        for y in row:
            if x == y:
                result.append((row, y))
    result.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0] + 1, -x[1]))
    return result
# Tests
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6],
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1],
]

test_cases = [
    (1, [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]),
    (2, [(1, 1), (2, 2), (2, 1)]),
    (3, [(2, 2)]),
    (0, []),
    (4, []),
]

for test_case in test_cases:
    matrix[0] = []
    matrix[1] = []
    matrix[2] = []
    got = get_row(matrix, test_case[0])
    print(f"get_row({matrix}, {test_case[0]}) => {got}")
    assert got == test_case[1], f"Expected {test_case[1]} but got {got}"
```
