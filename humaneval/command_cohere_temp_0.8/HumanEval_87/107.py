```python
def get_row(matrix, x):
    result = []
    for row in matrix:
        for y in row:
            if x == y:
                result.append((row, y))
    result.sort(key = lambda x: (x[0] + 1, x[1]))
    return result
```

The code finds elements `x` in a matrix and returns a list of tuples representing the coordinates of these elements in the format `(row, column)`. It iterates through each row in the matrix and for each element `y` in each row, it checks if `x` matches `y`. If a match is found, the tuple `(row, y)` is appended to the `result` list. The list of tuples is then sorted first by row in ascending order (using a custom sorting key that adds 1 to the row number) and then by column in ascending order within each row. Finally, it returns the sorted list of tuples.
