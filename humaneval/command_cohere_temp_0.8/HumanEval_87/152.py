```python
def get_row(lst, x):
    result = []
    for row in lst:
        row_x = [col for col in row if col == x]
        if row_x:
            result.append((len(lst) - row.index(row_x[0]) - 1, len(row_x)))
    return sorted(result, key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
```

The `get_row` function traverses through each row in the given list, identifying elements that match the targeted integer `x`, utilizing a list comprehension to collect these matching entries. The indices of the rows containing `x` and the columns of `x` in each row are computed, respectively. These coordinates are then sorted first by row in ascending order and then by column in descending order, ensuring the output is organized as intended. 

The output is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a coordinate pair: row and column. If there are multiple occurrences of `x` in a row, only the first occurrence is considered. The result is empty if no matching elements are found in any row.
