```python
def get_row(matrix, x):
    result = []
    for i, row in enumerate(matrix):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val == x:
                result.append((i, j))
    result.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    return result
```

The algorithm utilizes nested loops to traverse through the matrix. While iterating through the matrix rows, the nested loop iterates through the columns to find the position of the integer `x`. The found positions are then sorted first by row in ascending order and then by column in descending order using the `sort` method with an appropriate `key` argument. Finally, a test suite is added to validate the accuracy of the algorithm with edge examples. The code is implemented in a self-contained manner, allowing independent usage from any external libraries. 
The tests are commented out as they are not part of the actual code, but they can be uncommented and executed separately to properly validate the code. Relevant test suites are also provided to ensure that the function behaves as expected:
```python
# Test get_row for a simple case
test_get_row = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]]
x = 1
expected = [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]
result = get_row(test_get_row, x)
assert result == expected

# Test get_row with an empty list
empty_list = []
x = 1
result = get_row(empty_list, x)
assert result == []

# Test get_row with an empty row
empty_row = [[], [1], [1, 2, 3]]
x = 3
result = get_row(empty_row, x)
expected = [(2, 2)]
assert result == expected
