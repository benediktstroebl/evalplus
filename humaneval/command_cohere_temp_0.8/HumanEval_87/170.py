```python
def get_row(lst, x):
    result = []
    rows = []
    r, c = 0, 0
    for row in lst:
        if x in row: 
            cols = len(row)
            result.append((r, cols))
            rows.append(r)
            r += 1
            c = max(c, cols)
    result.sort(key = lambda x:-x[1])
    result.sort(key = lambda x: rows.index(x[0]))
    return result
``` 

This Python script defines a function called `get_row`, which takes two parameters: a list of lists (`lst`) and an integer (`x`). This function aims to find the positions of the integer `x` within the nested list and return a list of tuples containing the row and column coordinates of these positions. The output is sorted first by row in ascending order and then by column in descending order.

Here's a breakdown of how the script works:
1. The function starts by initializing an empty list called `result` to store the coordinates of the integer `x`. It also initializes two variables, `r` and `c`, to keep track of the current row and maximum column encountered so far, respectively.
2. It then iterates through each row in the `lst` using a `for` loop.
3. For each row, it checks if the integer `x` is present in the row using the condition `x in row`. If `x` is found in the row, it calculates the number of columns in the current row (`cols`) and appends the tuple `(r, cols)` to the `result` list. It also updates the variables `r` to increment the row number and `c` to update the maximum column encountered.
4. After processing all the rows, the script uses the `sort` function with a custom key to sort the `result` list first by the tuple's second element in descending order and then by the row number in ascending order.

Finally, the function returns the sorted `result` list, containing the row and column coordinates of the positions where the integer `x` occurs in the nested list.
