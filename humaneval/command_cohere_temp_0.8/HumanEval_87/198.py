```python
def get_row(matrix, x):
    result = []
    for row in matrix:
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val == x:
                result.append((row_index + 1, column_index + 1))
                column_index += 1
    result.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    return result
```

The nested list, `matrix`, is iterated through row by row. Within each row, the list is iterated through via `enumerate()` to keep track of the column index (`j`). When the value at the current index in the row (`val`) matches the target integer `x`, a tuple is constructed (`(row_index+1, column_index+1)`) and added to the `result` list. The `result` list is kept sorted based on the column index, with rows being sorted in ascending order. 

This solution works for the given examples and should be general enough to handle various cases as long as the input is a valid 2D list.
