```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
```python
import unittest

class TestAddFunction(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add_positive_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)

    def test_add_positive_numbers_second_case(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(5, 7), 12)
```

In the above code, the `add()` function takes two arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns their sum. It is a straightforward function that performs the addition of two integers.

The test suite, consisting of two test cases, is written using the `unittest` module. It ensures that the `add()` function behaves as expected. The `test_add_positive_numbers` test case verifies that the function correctly adds two positive integers, and the `test_add_positive_numbers_second_case` test case verifies the addition of two different positive integers.

Running the test suite with `unittest` will ensure that the `add()` function remains correct over time and is not affected by any code changes that might cause it to malfunction. This approach helps maintain code quality and ensures that these basic functionalities are working properly, which is particularly important for complex applications where errors are more likely to occur.
