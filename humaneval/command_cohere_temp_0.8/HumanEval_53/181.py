```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
```
Tested against the provided examples:
```
>>> add(2, 3)
5
>>> add(5, 7)
12
```
This code defines a function called `add` that takes two integer parameters, `x` and `y`. It simply adds the two numbers together using the `+` operator and returns the result, which is the sum of `x` and `y`. 

The test examples, taken directly from the problem statement, verify the function's behavior against the provided inputs and expected outputs.
