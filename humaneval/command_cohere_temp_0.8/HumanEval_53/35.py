```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    Add two numbers x and y
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """
    return x + y
```
This code defines a Python function called `add`. It takes two integer parameters, `x` and `y`, and calculates their sum. The function returns the result of the addition. The function includes a docstring that includes example Python `assert` statements. These example assertions demonstrate the expected behavior of the function when called with specific input values (2 and 3) and (5 and 7), respectively. These statements show that the function correctly adds the numbers and provide reassurance that the function is working as intended.  This is a way to provide test cases and show the expected behavior of a function directly within the function's documentation. 
The `add(2, 3)` assertion shows that the function behaves expectedly, returning 5 when 2 and 3 are passed to the function. The `add(5, 7)` assertion shows that the function behaves expectedly, returning 12 when 5 and 7 are passed to the function. These assertions help provide confidence in the correctness of the function's implementation. This approach is useful for documenting and validating code behavior within the function's definition, making it easier for others to understand and trust the function's purpose and functionality.
