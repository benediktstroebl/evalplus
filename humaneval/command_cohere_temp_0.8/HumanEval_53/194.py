```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
```python
import unittest

class TestAddFunction(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add_2_3(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)

    def test_add_5_7(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(5, 7), 12)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
The provided Python code comprises a function named "add" that performs integer addition, taking two integer parameters and returning their sum. It is accompanied by a test suite using the "unittest" module to validate the correctness of the "add" function. 

The test suite consists of two individual test cases, each examined by the "assertEqual" function. The first test case, "test_add_2_3," checks whether the sum of 2 and 3 is indeed 5. The second test case, "test_add_5_7," verifies if the sum of 5 and 7 yields 12. 

The "unittest.main()" function is used to execute the test suite and display testing results. Upon running the code, if all tests pass, no output is generated, indicating successful function validation. However, if any test fails, detailed diagnostic information is displayed, pinpointing the specific test case and the nature of the discrepancy.
