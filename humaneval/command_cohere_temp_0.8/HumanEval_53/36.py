```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    Add two numbers x and y
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """
    return x + y
```
This Python function takes two integers, `x` and `y`, as inputs, and it adds them together. The function returns the result of the addition, which is the sum of `x` and `y`. 

The function includes a docstring and docstrings are critical for documenting your code and providing information to others and future you. They also allow tools to extract information for documentation generation or to display helpful hints in integrated development environments (IDEs). 

The function also includes examples, or tests, that are written in the `pytest` style. These tests confirm that the function operates correctly. This is a robust practice because it verifies that the function works as expected and eliminates the possibility of introducing new errors while ensuring that the code remains functional. 

The tests check the function's behavior by making calls to the function with specific inputs and comparing the results to the expected values. In this case, the function is expected to return 5 when `x` is 2 and `y` is 3, and 12 when `x` is 5 and `y` is 7. The specific syntax used in these tests confirms that the function returns the values expected. These tests would fail if the function were to return incorrect values.
