```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
```
Tested against two test cases, adding two numbers correctly sums them, as shown by the test cases in the original problem statement.
```
You can use the `add` function in your code simply by calling it with two integers as follows:
```python
result = add(2, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 5
``` 
This will print `5`, which is the result of adding the two numbers `2` and `3`.
