```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    Add two numbers x and y
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """
    return x + y
```
This code defines a Python function called 'add'. This function takes in two integer parameters, 'x' and 'y', and calculates their sum. It performs the essential arithmetic operation, 'x + y', using the '+' operator, which results in the total of the two numbers. The function then returns this computed sum as its output. 

The function includes a docstring that provides documentation for the function. It includes examples of test cases that demonstrate how to use the 'add' function and confirms that it returns the correct results. The '>>>' token is used as a marker for these example tests in the documentation string. For the first test case, the function is called with the inputs 2 and 3, and it returns 5, which is the correct sum of these two numbers. The second test case involves calling the function with 5 and 7, and it returns 12, which is also the correct sum of these two numbers. 

Overall, the 'add' function is a straightforward and effective way to add two numbers in Python, and its thoughtful documentation makes it easy for others to understand and use.
