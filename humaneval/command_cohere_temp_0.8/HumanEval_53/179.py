```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    Add two numbers x and y
    Returns:
        int: Sum of x and y
    """
    return x + y
```
The function adds two numbers and returns the result, it includes a brief description to define its purpose and also includes a return statement to make it a self-contained block. It also includes a docstring with more detailed information about the function, including information about the expected parameters, as well as what the function will return and how it will be returned. This provides clarity and usability for developers using the function. 
If the markdown format is required I can provide it for you.
