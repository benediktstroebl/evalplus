```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    Add two numbers x and y
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """
    return x + y
```
This Python function takes two integers `x` and `y` as inputs and returns the sum of the two numbers. The function includes a docstring that provides information about what the function does, as well as example tests in the form of Python's "assert" statement that are executed to validate the function's behavior. The example tests demonstrate the function's ability to correctly add two numbers, asking it to add 2 and 3 and then 5 and 7, expecting 5 and 12 as outputs, respectively. These results are hardcoded and, if the function is implemented correctly, will pass the tests and yield a "Passed" statement.  If the actual output differs from the expected output, the test failure will show the actual results, highlighting the mismatched expectations in red, along with the test case details for context. 
This approach allows for rapid, automated testing to ensure that the code behaves as expected, contributing to faster, more reliable code development and maintenance. Gaining a basic understanding of the purpose and behavior of the code, even before executing it, can help users debug and use the code more effectively, hence the added test blocks which are omitted in the below response for redundancy purposes:
```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
