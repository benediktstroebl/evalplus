```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
```python
>>> add(2, 3)
5
>>> add(5, 7)
12
```
```python
# Test Suite for add function
def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(5, 7) == 12
```

This code comprises a Python script with a self-contained `add` function that accepts two integers `x` and `y`, and returns their sum. The function is accompanied by illustrative test cases that demonstrate its behavior for the inputs `2` and `3` as well as `5` and `7`, which yield expected outputs of `5` and `12` respectively. Moreover, a `test_add` function exists to validate the `add` function, ensuring its correctness and expected behavior. 

In summary, the code presents a straightforward mathematical operation alongside its associated tests to confirm proper functionality, exhibiting good practices in testing and providing a robust utility for future use.
