```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
```python
>> add(2, 3)
5
>> add(5, 7)
12
```
```python
# Test Suite for add function
def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5, "Expected 5, but got: " + str(add(2, 3)) 
    assert add(5, 7) == 12, "Expected 12, but got: " + str(add(5, 7))
```

The function `add` takes two integers as arguments and returns their sum. The function is tested against two test cases, adding two numbers and adding five and seven, confirming that it returns the correct result. You may use this code to determine the outcome of adding any two integers.
