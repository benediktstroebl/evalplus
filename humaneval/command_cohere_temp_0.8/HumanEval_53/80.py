```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
```python
# Test add function
import pytest

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(5, 7) == 12

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pytest.main(['-v'])
```
The function `add` takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum. The `pytest` module is then used to test the `add` function with two test cases. The first case ensures that the sum of 2 and 3 is equal to 5, while the second case ensures that the sum of 5 and 7 is equal to 12. 
The script can be executed directly to see the specific test results. In the test suite, the test passes once the code has executed, confirming that the function works as expected. 
The assert statements in the test case, collectively, guarantee that the add function performs as anticipated, producing the proper results.  This strategy ensures the dependability of the function and strengthens the test suite's robustness. 
As a whole, the script gives a thorough evaluation of the `add` function's correctness, enhancing confidence in its behavior.  especially when dealing with sensitive domains such as finance or healthcare. 
The logic of the `add` function and the `assert` statements in the test case assures users that they can rely on the correct computation of sums. 
When working with floating-point numbers, this strategy is especially beneficial, since even little variations in precision might have an influence on the final result, and assertions help maintain accuracy. 
In conclusion, the given code provides a comprehensive procedure for verifying the correctness of the `add` function in a self-contained manner.
