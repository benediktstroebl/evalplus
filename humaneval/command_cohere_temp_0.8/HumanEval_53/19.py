```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
The function takes in two arguments, x and y, both of type `int`. It returns the result of adding the two numbers together. 

To pass tests, consider adding the following markdown code block with the corresponding tests:
```python
>>> add(2, 3)
5
>>> add(5, 7)
12
```
These test cases verify the correctness of the solution. If the function implementation is correct, the output of these test cases should be consistent with the problem statement.
