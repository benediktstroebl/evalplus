```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
```python
>>> add(2, 3)
5
>>> add(5, 7)
12
```
```python
# Test Suite for add function
def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(5, 7) == 12
```

This code snippet includes the `add` function, example usage, and a test suite that ensures the function behaves as expected. The `add` function takes two integers `x` and `y` as arguments and returns their sum. The test suite includes two test cases that verify the function's behavior using the `assert` statement. If the `add` function does not change, the tests will pass and provide confidence in the correctness of the code.  It is important to run the tests every time the function is updated to ensure that it still works as expected. 
This approach follows the best practices in software development as it includes modular and well-tested code, which makes it easier to maintain and evolve the codebase over time. Futhermore, adding appropriate tests ensures that the code works correctly in different scenarios and helps detect bugs or unexpected behavior before they reach the production phase, reducing the risk of system failure.  In essence, testing code is an essential step in delivering reliable, high-quality software systems.
