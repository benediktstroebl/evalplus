```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    Add two numbers x and y
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """
    return x + y
```
This Python function takes two integers `x` and `y` as inputs and returns the sum of the two numbers. The function includes a docstring that provides information about what the function does, as well as examples of how to use the function with different values for `x` and `y`. These examples, contained in the docstring, are formatted using the `>>> ` syntax, which is used to indicate test examples in docstrings in Python.
