```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    Add two numbers x and y

    return x + y
```
This code defines a Python function called 'add'. This function takes in two integers 'x' and 'y' as arguments and returns the sum of these two numbers. The function includes a docstring that provides information about the function, specifically its purpose is to add two numbers. The docstring also includes example tests in the form of Python's "assert" statement that are executed when the function is called with the specified arguments. In these examples, the function correctly adds '2' and '3' to return '5' and adds '5' and '7' to return '12'.
