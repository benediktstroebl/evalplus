```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
The function `add` takes in two arguments, `x` and `y`, both of type `int`. It returns the sum of these two values by performing `x + y`. This method explicitly states what the function does and what values it expects in an easy-to-understand manner.
