```
Tested against the provided test cases, and they passed. You can use this function in your code to perform addition of two numbers. 
```
**Explanation:**
The function `add` takes two integers `x` and `y` as arguments and returns their sum. This behavior is demonstrated by the test cases in the original problem statement. 
```python
add(2, 3)
# --> 5

add(5, 7)
# --> 12
```
The function is straightforward and adheres to Python's [Pythonic style], which emphasizes readability and simplicity.
