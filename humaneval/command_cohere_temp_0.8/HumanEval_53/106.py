```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
```python
# Test add function
import pytest

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5

def test_add_negative():
    assert add(5, -2) == 3

def test_add_large():
    assert add(10, 7) == 17
```

The function `add` takes two arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns their sum. This code includes a `pytest` test suite with three test functions. Each test checks a different scenario by calling the `add` function with different input values and verifying that the output is correct.  This way, we ensure that the `add` function works as expected and passes all the tests.  The test code is external to the function code, but it is a self-contained script that can run independently to validate the `add` function.  In particular, the `assert` statements will cause the test to fail if the condition does not evaluate to True. A more detailed explanation and context can be helpful to ensure that I have addressed your needs wholly. Let me know if you would like more details!
