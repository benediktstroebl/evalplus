```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
```
Tested against two test cases:
```
1. >>> add(2, 3)
5
2. >>> add(5, 7)
12
```
The function takes in two integers, x and y, as parameters and returns their sum. It follows the function signature and returns the expected output. 
The test cases are also included, and the function successfully passes them, confirming that it behaves as expected.
