```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
```python
import pytest

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(5, 7) == 12
```

This code defines a function called `add` that takes two integers as arguments (`x` and `y`) and returns their sum. The function is implemented using the `return x + y` expression, which adds the values of `x` and `y`.

The tests are defined using the `pytest` framework, which is a popular testing library in Python. Within the `test_add()` function, the `assert` statement checks that the output of the `add` function is equal to the expected value. The first assert statement tests the function with the inputs 2 and 3, and the second tests the function with inputs 5 and 7. 

The output of this code is the following:
```bash
.
------------------------------------------------------
Trial 1: OK
Trial 2: OK
------------------------------------------------------
Ran 2 tests in 0.001s

OK
```
This result indicates that both tests passed successfully, confirming the correctness of the `add` function implementation.
