```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
```python
>> add(2, 3)
5
>> add(5, 7)
12
``` 

This code defines a function called add which takes two integers as arguments and returns their sum. The function is tested with two test cases, adding 2 and 3, and 5 and 7, and it successfully returns the expected results of 5 and 12, respectively.  This indicates that the function is working correctly.  This completes the validation of the added feature.
