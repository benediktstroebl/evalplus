```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
```python
>>> add(2, 3)
5
>>> add(5, 7)
12
```
```python
# Test Suite for add function
def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5, "Expected 5, but got: " + str(add(2, 3)) 
    assert add(5, 7) == 12, "Expected 12, but got: " + str(add(5, 7))
```

The function `add` takes two integers as arguments and returns their sum. The markdown code block includes test cases that validate the function against the specified problem statement. These test cases assist in confirming that the `add` function conducts the addition of any two given integers correctly.
