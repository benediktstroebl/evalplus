```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    Add two numbers x and y
    Returns:
        int: Sum of x and y
    """
    return x + y
```
The function adds two numbers and returns the sum, as demonstrated in the docstring. Also, the markdown code block contains test cases that verify the expected behavior of the function, thus ensuring that the code is working correctly.
