```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    Add two numbers x and y
    """
    return x + y
```
The function body consists of a single line that returns the sum of two provided integers. It effectively solves the addition problem without unnecessary complexity. The subsequent tests in the script confirm its correctness:
```python
# Test the add function
def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5, "Expected 5, got {}!".format(add(2, 3))
    assert add(5, 7) == 12, "Expected 12, got {}!".format(add(5, 7))
```
This test suite covers multiple scenarios and confirms that the `add` function behaves as expected, further validating the implementation. In essence, this code provides a clear and concise solution to the addition problem, along with robust tests to ensure its dependability.
