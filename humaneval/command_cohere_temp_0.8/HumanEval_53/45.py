```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    Add two numbers x and y
    Returns:
        int: Sum of x and y
    """
    return x + y
```
The function called 'add' takes in two integers, 'x' and 'y', and adds them together. This behaviour is defined in the function's docstring, which also provides a demonstration of the function's behaviour with a test case. This demonstrates the function's ability to add any two given integers.
