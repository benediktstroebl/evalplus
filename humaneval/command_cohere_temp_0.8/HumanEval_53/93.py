```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
```
Tested against two test cases, adding two numbers correctly adds them together, matching the behavior of the specification.
```
These test cases ensure that the function behaves correctly with both positive and negative integers. To illustrate the use of the function, here are some examples of usage:
```python
add(2, 3) # 5
add(5, 7) # 12
add(-2, 2) # 0
add(0, 0) # 0
``` 
The function allows for flexible and intuitive addition of any two integers. Feel free to use it in your projects or further adapt it to specific needs!
