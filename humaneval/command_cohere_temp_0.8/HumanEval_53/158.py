```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
```python
# Test add function
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize('test_input, expected', [
    (2, 3, 5),
    (5, 7, 12)
])
def test_add(test_input, expected):
    result = add(test_input, y=test_input[1])
    assert result == expected
```
This code defines a function called `add` that takes two arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns their sum. It then provides a series of test cases in the form of a dictionary with test inputs and expected results. The `test_add` function asserts that the result of calling the `add` function with the corresponding test inputs is equal to the expected result.  This way, we ensure that the `add` function works as expected.  By using `pytest.mark.parametrize`, we create multiple tests at once, reducing repetition and making the test suite more efficient. 
To run this test suite, you can use a test runner, like `pytest`. 

Note: The code block that starts with ````python` represents a Python script that can be executed directly, and the subsequent code block in the markdown file represents a unit test for the `add` function.  By using parametrize, we create multiple tests at once, reducing repetition and making the test suite more efficient. 

Feel free to customize the test cases according to your specific requirements.
