```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
```
Tested against the provided Markdown code blocks, and the function correctly adds the two numbers.
```

The Python script defines a function `add` that takes two arguments `x` and `y`, both of type `int`. The function returns the result of adding `x` and `y` together. This implementation ensures that the function is self-contained and provides the expected behavior, adding two numbers as specified in the problem statement. Additionally, the code includes type annotations, which are optional but useful for conveying the expected types of arguments and returning values, improving code clarity, and enabling better code understanding and utilization in various development environments and tools.
