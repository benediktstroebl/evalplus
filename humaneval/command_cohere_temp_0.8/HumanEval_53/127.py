```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    Add two numbers x and y
    Returns:
        int: Sum of x and y
    """
    return x + y
```
The function adds two numbers and returns the result, the markdown block shows example usage and the expected output. 
The `>>>` is a delimiter for a code block in markdown, often three backticks (``), denotes a code block. Inside the code block, you can use the `python` syntax to execute a script. The output of the script will be flushed to the console unless an exception is thrown. 
If you intend to include tests, you may want to use a testing framework like `pytest` for more structured and organized tests. Using this or any other testing framework, you can verify the functionality of your code and automatically run tests every time you make changes to your code. This makes your development process smoother and safer, especially for larger codebases and more complex functionalities.
