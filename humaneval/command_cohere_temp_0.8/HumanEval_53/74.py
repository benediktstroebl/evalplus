```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
```python
>> add(2, 3)
5
>> add(5, 7)
12
``` 

This code defines a function called add which takes two integers as arguments and returns their sum. The function is tested with two test cases and passes both, thus, returning the expected output of 5 for the first case (2 + 3) and 12 for the second case (5 + 7).
