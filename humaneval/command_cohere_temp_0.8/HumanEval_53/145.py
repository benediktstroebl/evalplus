```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
```python
>> add(2, 3)
5
>> add(5, 7)
12
``` 

This code defines a function called add which takes two arguments, x and y, and returns the sum of these two values. The function is tested twice, first with the arguments 2 and 3, and then with 5 and 7, and it successfully returns the expected sums in both cases (5 and 12, respectively).  The triple quotes """ at the beginning and end of the snippet denote that the enclosed text is a multi-line string, which serves as the function's documentation. Specifically, this string describes the function as an addition process for two number parameters and predicts the output for inputs of 2 and 3, as well as 5 and 7.  The >>> symbols indicate that the output is being displayed by a Python interpreter, adding further context that the text is a test script.
