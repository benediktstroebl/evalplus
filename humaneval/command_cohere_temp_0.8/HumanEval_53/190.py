```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    Add two numbers x and y
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """
    return x + y
```
This Python function takes two integers, `x` and `y`, as inputs, and computes and returns their sum, `x + y`. The function showcases the use of the `return` statement to assign a result to the evaluated expression `x + y`. The function also includes a docstring, which is a multi-line comment that provides a more detailed explanation of the function's purpose, inputs, and expected behavior. This helps developers quickly understand how to use the function and its expected behavior. 

The placeholder test outputs (`5` and `12`) are also included within the docstring, enclosed in `>>> ` blocks. These serve as examples of the expected output when the function is called with specific arguments, providing additional guidance on the behavior of the function and aiding in testing and validation. 
The function can be successfully compiled and run without errors.  optimally, it would be coupled with tests to ensure its correctness, adhering to the assertion and behaving as expected for any input values. 
Please note that for actual testing, it is recommended to use testing frameworks like `pytest` or `unittest` for more comprehensive and structured testing, providing greater confidence in the correctness of the code.  This approach is widely adopted in Python development to ensure functionality and maintainability of code.
