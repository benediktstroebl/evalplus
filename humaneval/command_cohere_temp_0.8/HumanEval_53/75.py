```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
```python
import pytest

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(5, 7) == 12
```

This code defines a function called `add` that takes two integers as arguments (`x` and `y`) and returns their sum. The function is effectively documented by examples in the test cases that clearly show its behavior and expectations. These test cases are structured to validate the correctness of the `add` function and ensure its adherence to the expected addition of two provided integers. 

The `pytest` module is imported to facilitate testing. The `test_add` function uses the `assert` statement to confirm whether the outcome of calling `add(2, 3)` and `add(5, 7)` is equal to their expected values, which in this case are `5` and `12` respectively. 

By running this code, you can verify that the `add` function operates as anticipated and that the test cases pass, consequently validating the problem solution.
