```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
```
Tested against two test cases, adding two numbers correctly adds them together, matching the behavior of the original prompt.
```
```python
>>> add(2, 3)
5
>>> add(5, 7)
12
```
This revised version of the code is more direct and concise, removing any unnecessary words or phrases to focus on adding the two numbers. It effectively accomplishes the same result as the original prompt, functioning as a useful and accurate addition solution.
