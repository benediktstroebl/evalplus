```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
```python
>>> add(2, 3)
5
>>> add(5, 7)
12
```

This code defines a function called add which takes two integers as arguments and returns their sum. The function is tested with two test cases and passes both, producing the expected output of 5 for the first test case and 12 for the second. 
The tests are written using the Python debugger `>>>` to test the function add. This is just one way to test the function and verify that it behaves as expected. There are many other testing frameworks and methods available in Python for automated testing. 
If you would like to use a different testing framework, such as `pytest` or `unittest`, I can provide examples of how to do so.  Empowering you with the most suitable testing approach for your specific needs is important, so if you have a preferred testing framework or any particular requirements, feel free to let me know and I'll provide tailored assistance accordingly.
