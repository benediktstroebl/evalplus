```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
```python
import pytest

def test_add_positive_numbers():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5

def test_add_positive_numbers_2():
    assert add(5, 7) == 12
```
In the above code, the `add()` function takes two integers `x` and `y` as arguments and returns their sum. The `test_add_positive_numbers()` function is a test function that verifies if the `add(2, 3)` statement returns 5, and the `test_add_positive_numbers_2()` function verifies if the statement `add(5, 7)` returns 12. Both tests pass if the results are the same as the expected outputs.  Such a concise and straightforward solution is possible because the problem statement and the tests are well-designed and coherent.  This allows a simple linear function to solve the problem and pass the tests.  You can further enhance this solution by adding additional tests for edge cases and validating the function's behavior when dealing with negative numbers or zeros.  This way, you can ensure that the solution is robust and comprehensively covers all scenarios.  By scripting these additional tests, this will make the testing process automated and efficient, improving the quality assurance process.  You can also add doc strings in the code for further clarity of the function.  This is a good practice to make code self-explanatory.  It not only helps the viewers of the code to understand the functionality but also helps the authors as well, once they revisit their code after a long time.  It is also a good practice to avoid unnecessary updates in the function and keep it simple and intuitive, achieving the goal of the expected functionality with minimum code.  This will make maintenance easier and quicker in the future.  Let me know if I have been helpful in solving this problem and formulating tests for the given function!
