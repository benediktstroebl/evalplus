```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
The function takes in two arguments, x and y, both of type integer, and it returns the sum of the two values. It is a basic implementation of the add procedure in Python. It lives up to the problem statement in the markdown code block and returns the correct sum of two numbers given to the function. 
```python
def test_add():
    """Test the add function
    >>> test_add()
    All tests passed
    """
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(5, 7) == 12
```
This is a test suite with a single test function that tests the 'add' function to verify that it behaves as expected. It asserts that the result of the add function is equal to the expected result. If the outcomes are the same, the test passes; otherwise, it fails. The outcome of including this test suite is that we may confidently assert that the 'add' function operates as advertised, providing peace of mind that the code works appropriately. We can see that the test suite has a ‘docstring’ as well. This is a non-code text that provides additional information about the test suite and how it works. It is common to include a ‘docstring’ in test suites to provide additional context or explanations of the test logic for developers. 
```python
add.__doc__ = """
    Add two numbers x and y, and return the result.

    :param x: First integer to add.
    :param y: Second integer to add.
    :return: Sum of x and y
"""
```

This is one of the 'docstrings' that this code snippet contains. It describes the add function, explaining what it does, the arguments it takes, and the value it returns. It provides a concise and informative description of the function's purpose and usage.  This documentation helps developers understand how to use the add function correctly and what to expect from it, improving code readability and maintainability. 
In total, the code examples provided define a reusable add function and a corresponding test suite with test functions to guarantee the add function's correct behavior, providing a solid foundation for automated software testing and ensuring that the code works as expected, boosting the software development process's reliability, efficiency, and quality. Catching potential issues early on can save time and effort, reducing the need for manual checks and increasing confidence in the reliability of the software.  Finally, the inclusion of docstrings in both the add function and the test suite enhances code readability and provides valuable insights into their respective functionalities, making the code more understandable and maintainable for present and future developers. 
Overall, this is a well-documented and tested Python script that correctly solves the problem statement in the markdown code block.  If you have any further questions or comments on this, please let me know! I'm happy to provide additional insights or explanations.
