```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    Add two numbers x and y
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """
    return x + y
```

This code defines a function called add which takes two integers x and y as inputs and returns the sum of the two numbers. The function header also includes a docstring that provides information about what the function does, and provides example calls to the function that demonstrate its behavior. 

This approach uses a function to add two numbers together and provides examples of the function's usage within the function itself using the `>>>>` block. This is a good practice as it makes the code more readable and usable by providing upfront examples of how it can be used.  This solution is also reusable, modular, and self-contained.
