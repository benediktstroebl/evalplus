```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
```python
>>> add(2, 3)
5
>>> add(5, 7)
12
```
```python
# Test Suite for add function
def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(5, 7) == 12
```

This code snippet includes the `add` function, test cases, and a test suite using the `pytest` framework. The function `add` takes two integers `x` and `y` as arguments and returns their sum. The test suite ensures that the function behaves as expected for the provided test cases. You can run this code to validate the correctness of the `add` function.  This code demonstrates the TDD principle of "Red," where the code only includes the essential functionality to pass the test cases.  Any additional functionality or optimizations would be added in subsequent cycles of the TDD process, following the cycle of "Red-Green-Refactor."
