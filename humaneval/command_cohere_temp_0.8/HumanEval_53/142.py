```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    Add two numbers x and y
    Returns:
        int: Sum of x and y
    """
    return x + y
```
The function `add()` takes in two integers and returns the sum of the two numbers. The function is self-contained and does not require any external dependencies. 
The tests that correspond to this function are:
```python
# Test suite for add function
def test_add():
    """Test case for add function"""
    assert add(2, 3) == 5, "Expected add(2, 3) to output 5"
    assert add(5, 7) == 12, "Expected add(5, 7) to output 12"
```
These tests ensure that the `add()` function correctly adds two numbers. When executing this code, you can use the `pytest` library to automatically discover and run the test cases. If all tests pass, you should see an indication that all tests were successful. GIVEN this code, you can confidently use the `add()` function in your projects, knowing that it works and is tested.  If you are working in a team, sharing tested and validated code snippets like this can be a valuable practice for streamlining collaboration and ensuring consistent coding standards. 
You can use the `add` function in your Python program by calling it with two integer arguments to get their sum. 
For example:
```python
result = add(4, 6) # 10
print(result)
```
This would print out `10`, which is the sum of `4` and `6`.  choosing to use tested and shared code snippets like this can help you accelerate your project deliverables and maintain high code quality.  By adopting this approach, you avoid redundant development efforts and can quickly integrate proven and reusable solutions into your codebase.
