```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    Add two numbers x and y
    Returns:
        int: Sum of x and y
    """
    return x + y
```
The function adds two numbers and the markdown block provides example usage and returns the expected int value. 
This approach aligns with Python's philosophy on code readability and maintainability. Let's take a closer look at how this aligns with the DRY principle and provides better maintainability.

If we wanted to test this function we would need to make sure we covered multiple cases. The tests could look something like this:
```python
def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(5, 7) == 12
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0
    assert add(10, -5) == 5
```

We have now doubled the amount of code because we have replicated the functionality found in the original function in the test functions. If the function or the tests need to be changed, it will require modifying at least two different code blocks. By applying the DRY principle, we could instead create a more concise test that focuses solely on the edge cases and leaves the behavioral description to the function's docstring.
```python
def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(5, 7) == 12
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0
    assert add(10, -5) == 5
```

This test code is much more maintainable as it only focuses on the edge cases that we want to check, without repeating the behavioral description. To better understand the impact of applying the DRY principle on this code, let's consider what would happen if the function had 20 additional edge cases. In the first example, this would require writing 40 additional lines to test all of the cases. However, in the second example, this would only require writing 20 additional lines of code. This is a much more manageable task and requires less time, energy, and cognitive load for developers to understand and maintain. 

In summary, by following the DRY principle, we can create a more maintainable code base by eliminating code duplication. This not only reduces the amount of code but also creates looser coupling, which leads to less time and effort required to make modifications and more reliable and manageable code.
