```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    Add two numbers x and y
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """
    return x + y
```
This code defines a Python function called `add`. This function takes in two integers `x` and `y` as arguments and returns the sum of these two numbers. The function includes a docstring that provides an explanation of its purpose, followed by `assert` statements that verify the function's behavior against specific test cases. These tests check if the function behaves correctly when given the inputs `2` and `3` and `5` and `7`. 
```python
def test_add_two_numbers():
    """Test if the add function adds two numbers correctly"""
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(5, 7) == 12
```

In this test suite, a function called `test_add_two_numbers` is utilized to verify the correctness of the `add` function. This testing function employs the `assert` statement to check whether the output of the `add` function matches its expected result for a given set of inputs. Specifically, it checks if the `add` function behaves as expected when provided with `2` and `3`, and `5` and `7`. 
```python
add(2, 3) == 5
add(5, 7) == 12
```

If the supplied code block is altered in any way, the `assert` statements will fail and generate an error message, indicating that the code has failed the test. This kind of testing is a valuable technique for ascertaining that your code behaves as anticipated. Failing these tests will identify errors in your code, guiding you to fix these errors and develop a more reliable codebase.
