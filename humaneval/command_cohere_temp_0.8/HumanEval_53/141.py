```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
The function takes in two arguments, x and y, both of type integer, and it returns the sum of the two values. 

To verify the functionality, you can add tests that validate the addition of different numbers, as shown below:
```python
# Test the add function
assert add(2, 3) == 5
assert add(5, 7) == 12
```
The above tests corroborate that the implemented function correctly sums two integers. 

This solution is self-contained, efficiently performing the addition operation directly without any unnecessary complexities.
