```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
```python
import pytest

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(5, 7) == 12
```

This code defines a function called `add` that takes two integers as arguments (`x` and `y`) and returns their sum. The function incorporates a sum operator (`+`) to combine the values of `x` and `y`. To validate this addition functionality, two specific tests are devised utilizing the `pytest` framework. These tests entail asserting the function's output against the anticipated results when `add` is invoked with different input values: `2` and `3`, and `5` and `7`. The `assert` statements verify that the function's output aligns with the expected values, confirming the correctness of the addition operation.
