```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
```python
>>> add(2, 3)
5
>>> add(5, 7)
12
``` 

This code defines a function called add which takes two arguments, x and y, and returns the sum of these two arguments. The function is defined as `def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:`. The colons at the end indicate that the function returns an integer value. The function performs the sum operation using the `+` operator, and the result is returned. 

The test cases are also provided in the code to verify the correctness of the `add` function. These test cases are structured as a list of integers, where each list element corresponds to the expected sum of a specific input. The `add` function is applied to these lists, and the results are compared to the expected output, ensuring the accuracy of the function.  It is a basic example of how to use the `def` keyword to create a function in Python and how to use it to organize code that performs a specific task. 
The script provided solves the problem and passes the tests, as required. It is a simple and straightforward solution.
