```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
The function takes in two arguments, x and y, both of type integer, and it returns the sum of the two values. 

To ensure the function matches the provided documentation, examples for the function are also included:
```python
# Test Suite
import pytest

pytest.fixture(scope="function")[
    assert add(2, 3) == 5, "Add function failed test 1"
]
pytest.fixture(scope="function")[
    assert add(5, 7) == 12, "Add function failed test 2"
]
``` 
The test suite includes tests that verify the function works correctly with both positive and correct integer values. 

To run the test suite, you can use pytest by running the script in the Python environment of your choice. 

Is there anything else I can help you with?
