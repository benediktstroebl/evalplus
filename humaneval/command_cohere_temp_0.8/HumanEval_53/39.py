```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    Add two numbers x and y
    Returns:
        int: Sum of x and y
    """
    return x + y
```
The function adds two numbers and returns the result, it includes a summary of the function's purpose in the docstring, and example usage in the comments. 
This approach ensures comprehension of the code and provides clarity for users to utilize the function.
