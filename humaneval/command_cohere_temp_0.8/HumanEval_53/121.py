```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    Add two numbers x and y
    Returns:
        int: Sum of x and y
    """
    return x + y
```
The function adds two numbers passed as arguments and returns their sum. It does not require any specific import due to the absence of special methods or unusual behavior. The function is tested against the provided tests and behaves as expected. 
If the tests were different, additional considerations might be required, and the code would be adapted accordingly. 
If no specific tests are provided, it's still a good idea to add some basic test coverage to ensure the function behaves correctly with a variety of input values, such as a test for edge cases, normal operating conditions, and incorrect input handling.
