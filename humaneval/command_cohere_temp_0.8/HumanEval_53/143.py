```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    Add two numbers x and y
    >>> add(2, 3)

    >>> add(5, 7)

    """
    return x + y
```
This Python function takes two integers `x` and `y` as inputs and returns the sum of the two numbers. The function includes a docstring that provides information about what the function does, and also includes example test cases as underlined code that verify the correct behavior of the function. These test cases are executed when the script is run with the `python` command, and they print the expected output for the function when it is called with corresponding arguments.
