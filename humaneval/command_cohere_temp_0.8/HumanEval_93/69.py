```python
def encode(message):
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    swapped = ''.join(letter.swapcase() if letter.isalpha() else letter for letter in message)
    return swapped.lower() if letter < 'ß' else swapped.upper() for letter in swapped if letter not in vowels else vowels.index(letter) + 2 for letter in vowels]
```

This code defines a function `encode` that takes a message as an input. It swaps the case of all letters and replaces all vowels with the letter that appears 2 places ahead of it in the English alphabet. The code uses a generator expression which is more memory efficient when working with larger strings as it doesn't require the entire new string to be generated at once. The final output is either a lowercase or uppercase encoded string depending on if the original message contains the eszett ß character. This character is excluded from the string conversion to lowercase.
