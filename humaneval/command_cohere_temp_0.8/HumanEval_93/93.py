```python
def encode(message):
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    swapped = ''.join(c.swapcase() if c.isalpha() else c for c in message)
    return swapped.translate(str.maketrans(vowels, vowels[2:] + vowels[:2]))
```

This script defines a function `encode` that takes a message as an input. It takes every character in the message and checks if it is a vowel, swapping the case for other characters. The vowels are then replaced by the characters 2 places ahead of them in the English alphabet. The script then provides a few examples of the `encode` function's behavior when provided different messages as inputs.
