```python
def encode(message):
    vowels = 'AEIOUaeiou'
    new_message = ''
    for char in message:
        if char.isalpha():
            if char in vowels:
                new_message += chr(ord(char) + 2)
            else:
                new_message += chr(ord(char) ^ 32)
        else:
            new_message += char
    return new_message
```

This code defines a function `encode` that takes a message as an input. It then does the following steps:
1. Collects all vowels in uppercase and lowercase in the `vowels` variable.
2. Initializes an empty string `new_message` to store the encoded message.
3. Iterates through each character in the input message.
4. If the character is a letter:
   - If the character is a vowel, it calculates the new character by adding 2 to the absolute value of its ASCII code and then concatenates it to `new_message`.
   - If the character is not a vowel, it calculates the new character by flipping the case of the character and then concatenates it to `new_message`.
5. If the character is not a letter, it is treated as a special character and directly appended to `new_message`.

The function then returns the `new_message`, which is the encoded version of the input message.
