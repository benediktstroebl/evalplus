```python
def encode(message):
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    swapped = ''.join(c.swapcase() if c.isalpha() else c for c in message)
    return swapped.translate(str.maketrans(vowels, vowels[2:] + vowels[:2]))
```

This code defines a function `encode` that takes a message as an input. It initiates a variable `vowels` with all the vowels of the English alphabet in both upper and lower case. Using a list comprehension, it creates a new string `swapped` by swapping the case of every letter and leaving non-letter characters untouched. Then, using the `translate` method, it replaces all vowels with the 2nd letter ahead of their place in the English alphabet. This is achieved by creating a translation table with `str.maketrans` where the vowel characters are shifted two places ahead in the alphabet. 

The resulting string is then returned as the encoded message. 

This function encodes messages as described in the prompt. For example:
```python
encode('test') # TGST
encode('This is a message') # tHKS KS C MGSSCGG
```
