```python
def encode(message):
    vowels = 'AEIOUaeiou'
    swapped = ''.join(char.swapcase() if char.isalpha() else char for char in message)
    return swapped.translate(str.maketrans(vowels, vowels[2:] + vowels[:2]))
```

This script defines a function `encode` that takes a message as an input. It then does the following:
1. Collects all vowels in the English alphabet, both uppercase and lowercase, into a string `vowels`.
2. Uses a list comprehension to iterate through every character in the input message.
    - If the character is a letter, it is swapped case-wise using the `swapcase()` method.
    - If the character is not a letter, it remains unchanged.
3. Creates a translation table using the `str.maketrans()` method. This table maps each vowel to the character 2 places ahead of it in the alphabet.
4. Uses the `translate()` method to apply this translation to the message.

The resulting string is then returned encoded as described in the problem prompt.

Note that this script assumes that the input contains only letters. If the input contains non-alphabetical characters, they will be untouched as they are not included in the translation. If you wish to handle all characters similarly, a more comprehensive encoding strategy may be needed. 

Feel free to experiment with the script to understand how it works, and let me know if you have further questions or if you would like me to explain any part of it in more detail.
