```python
def encode(message):
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    new_message = []
    
    for char in message:
        if char.isalpha():
            if char in vowels:
                new_message.append(alphabet[alphabet.index(char) + 2])
            else:
                new_message.append(char.swapcase())
        else:
            new_message.append(char)
    
    return ''.join(new_message)
```

The function goes through each character in the `message` using a loop. It checks if the character is a letter, and if so, whether it is a vowel. If the character is a vowel, it gets replaced by the letter that is two places ahead of it in the English alphabet. If the character is not a vowel, it gets swapped case. All other characters (non-letters) are left unchanged and appended to the new message. Ultimately, the function returns a new message encoded according to the criteria described in the problem. 

To test this script, you can run the following code:
```python
def test_encode():
    message = 'test'
    expected_output = 'TGST'
    assert encode(message) == expected_output

    message = 'This is a message'
    expected_output = 'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'
    assert encode(message) == expected_output

test_encode()
```

The tests will confirm that the function encodes messages according to the rules described in the problem.  The `assert` statement checks that the encoded value of the message returned by the `encode` function is equal to the expected output.  If the encoding is correct, the assertion passes, and the test suite completes successfully.  If not, the execution halts and highlights the discrepancies between the actual and expected outputs, aiding in debugging.  This testing framework is reusable and extensible for further testing and encoding checks.
