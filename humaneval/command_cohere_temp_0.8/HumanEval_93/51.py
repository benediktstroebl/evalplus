```python
def encode(message):
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    res = ''
    for char in message:
        if char.isalpha():
            if char in vowels:
                res += alphabet[alphabet.find(char) + 2]
            else:
                res += char.swapcase()
        else:
            res += char
    return res
```

This code defines a function `encode` that takes a message as an input. The function then proceeds to separately process all characters in the message depending on if they are vowels or consonants. 

For vowels, the function uses the `find` method to get the offset of the vowel in the alphabet, and then adds 2 to this offset to retrieve the character that is two places later in the alphabet. This character is then added to the `res` string being built. 

For consonants, the function uses the `swapcase` method to swap the case of the character, which corresponds to the requirement of swapping the case of all letters.

The script can be tested with the provided examples:
```python
>>> encode('test')
'tGST'
>>> encode('This is a message')
'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'
```
