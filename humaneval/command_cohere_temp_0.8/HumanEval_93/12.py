```python
def encode(message):
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    swapped = ''.join(c.swapcase() if c.isalpha() else c for c in message)
    return swapped.translate(str.maketrans(vowels, vowels[2:] + vowels[:2]))
```

This code uses the `translate` method to replace all vowels with the 2nd letter ahead of their position in the English alphabet, as per the problem statement. It first creates a string of all the vowels (both uppercase and lowercase) and then uses `str.maketrans` to create a translation table that moves each vowel 2 places ahead. This is achieved by constructing the translation table as `vowels[2:] + vowels[:2]`, where `vowels[:2]` moves the first two vowels to their correct positions and `vowels[2:] `catches the remaining vowels and moves them one position ahead. The message is then translated using this table to swap vowels accordingly. The output of the example messages provided in the prompt is:
