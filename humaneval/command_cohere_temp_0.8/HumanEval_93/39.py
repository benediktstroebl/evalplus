```python
def encode(message):
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    new_message = ''
    for char in message:
        if char.isalpha():
            if char in vowels:
                new_message += chr(ord(char) + 2)
            else:
                new_message += chr(ord(char) ^ 0x20)
        else:
            new_message += char
    return new_message
```

The provided Python script solves the problem by iterating through each character in the input `message`. When a character is a letter (found using the `isalpha()` function), it checks if the character is a vowel. If it is, it increments the ASCII value by 2 to shift forward in the alphabet. If not, it performs a case swap by XORing the ASCII value with 0x20. All other characters are added to the new message as is. 

This algorithm ensures that all letters flip case and vowels move two places ahead in the alphabet, following the problem's requirements.
