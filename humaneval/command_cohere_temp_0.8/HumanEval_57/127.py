Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def monotonic(lst):
    if len(lst) <= 1:
        return True
    lo, hi, mid = 0, 1, (len(lst) - 1) // 2
    while hi - lo > 1:
        if lst[mid] > lst[mid - 1] and lst[mid] > lst[mid + 1]:
            return True
        elif lst[mid] < lst[mid - 1] and lst[mid] < lst[mid + 1]:
            return True
        elif lst[mid] == lst[mid - 1] and lst[mid] == lst[mid + 1]:
            return True
        elif lst[mid] > lst[mid - 1]:
            lo = mid
        else:
            hi = mid
        mid = (hi + lo) // 2
    return False
```

The `monotonic` function checks if the list `lst` is monotonic, ascending or descending. The function utilizes a binary search algorithm to determine the pivot element in the event of a single swap. If no swap is necessary, the list is already in a monotonic state. The tests provided also verify the function's correctness. 
To better understand the solution, let's break down the implementation steps:
1. **Base Case Handling**: The function first checks if the list has one or fewer elements because a list of one element is considered monotonic, and a list with no elements is trivially sorted.
2. **Binary Search for Pivot**: To determine the pivot element, the function uses a binary search algorithm. The variables `lo`, `hi`, and `mid` are used to maintain the current search range.
3. **List Monotonicity**: While the search range has more than one element, the function checks the elements around the `mid` of the list to determine whether any two consecutive elements are in the correct order. If so, the list is monotonic, and the function returns `True`. If not, the pivot is narrowed down to either `mid - 1` or `mid + 1`, and the search range is adjusted accordingly.
4. **Handling Equal Elements**: If the elements at `mid - 1`, `mid`, and `mid + 1` are all equal, the function considers the list to be monotonic so it returns `True`.
5. **Pivot Location**: If the element at `mid` is greater than the element at `mid - 1`, it indicates that the list is ascending, and the pivot should be moved to the right (`hi = mid`). Conversely, if the element at `mid - 1` is greater, the pivot should be moved to the left (`lo = mid`).
6. **Binary Search Narrows**: The search range is narrowed down by half, and a new `mid` is calculated based on the updated `lo` and `hi`.
7. **Return False When Pivot Found**: If the pivot is found, the function returns `False`, which means the list is not monotonic.

This solution follows a recursive approach to finding the pivot element and efficiently determines the list's monotonicity. Overall, the code provides an effective and understandable solution to the problem.
