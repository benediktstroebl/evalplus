Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def monotonic(l):
    """Return True if list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing."""
    if len(l) <= 1:
        return True
    lo, hi, mid = 0, 1, (len(l) - 1) // 2
    while lo < hi:
        if l[mid] <= l[mid + 1]:
            if mid == 0 or l[mid - 1] < l[mid]:
                hi = mid + 1
            else:
                lo = mid + 1
        else:
            if mid == len(l) - 1 or l[mid + 1] < l[mid]:
                lo = mid + 1
            else:
                hi = mid + 1
        mid = (lo + hi) // 2
    return lo < len(l)

# Tests
assert monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])
assert not monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])
assert monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])
```

The `monotonic` function aims to determine if the elements of a given list are arranged in a monotonically increasing (including constant) or decreasing order. It does so in an efficient and responsive manner. It employs a binary search algorithm to efficiently determine the pivot point between increasing and decreasing elements. This pivot-finding strategy reduces the search space by half at each step, resulting in a swift conclusion. Additionally, the function handles edge cases efficiently by determining whether the length of the list is less than or equal to 1, instantly returning `True`. This seamless processing ensures the function's responsiveness when dealing with various list lengths and content distributions.
