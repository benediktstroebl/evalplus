Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def monotonic(lst):
    if len(lst) <= 1:
        return True
    elif lst[1] >= lst[0]:
        return monotonic(lst[1:]) and True
    elif lst[1] <= lst[0]:
        return monotonic(lst[1:]) and False
    else:
        return False
```
The function monotonic takes a list lst as input and returns True if the list's elements are monotonically increasing, meaning each element is greater than or equal to the previous one, and False otherwise. The base case is to check if the list has one or more elements, returning True in the first case and using element 2 to compare with element 1 for the general case. From there, it uses recursion, calling itself with the list minus the first element, to see if the monotonic property holds. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20]))  # Output: True
print(monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10]))  # Output: False
print(monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10]))  # Output: True
```
This should return the True for the first two examples and False for the last example.
