Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def monotonic(lst):
    if len(lst) <= 1:
        return True
    lo, hi, mid = 0, 1, (len(lst) - 1) // 2
    while lo <= hi:
        if lst[mid] <= lst[mid - 1] and lst[mid] <= lst[mid + 1]:
            return True
        elif lst[mid] >= lst[mid - 1] and lst[mid] >= lst[mid + 1]:
            return True
        elif lst[mid] < lst[mid - 1] and lst[mid + 1] <= lst[mid]:
            hi = mid - 1
        elif lst[mid] > lst[mid - 1] and lst[mid + 1] >= lst[mid]:
            lo = mid + 1
        else:
            return False
        mid = (lo + hi) // 2
    return False
```
The function monotonic takes a list lst as input and returns True if the list's elements are monotonic (increasing or decreasing) and False otherwise. The algorithm utilizes a binary search approach to efficiently determine the monotonicity of the list. It splits the list into three parts: the first part, the second part, and the middle element. The function compares the middle element with the first part and the second part to determine whether the list is monotonic. If the middle element is larger than the first part and smaller than the second part, the list is monotonic. Otherwise, it is not monotonic. 
Here is how you can use the function:
```python
print(monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20]))
print(monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10]))
print(monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10]))
```
This should return:
```bash
True
False
True
```
Note that the code assumes that the list is already sorted and does not perform any sorting operations. If the list is not sorted, the function may not work as expected. You should verify the list is sorted before running this function.
