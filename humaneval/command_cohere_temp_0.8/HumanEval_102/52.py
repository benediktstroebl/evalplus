```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    min_even = max(x, y) // 2
    return max(max_even, min_even) if max_even >= min_even and max_even % 2 == 0 else -1
```

The code defines a function choose_num, which takes two positive numbers x and y as input and returns the largest even integer that falls within the range of [x, y], inclusive. Using the modulo operator (`%`), the code identifies the largest even number within the range by taking the average of the two numbers (`(x + y) // 2`) and checking if it is less than or equal to the smallest even number within the range `(max(x, y) // 2)`. The function returns the largest even number within the range if it exists, or -1 if no such number is found. 

Here is a test drive code to ensure the function runs properly:
```python
test_cases = [
    (12, 15, 14),
    (13, 12, -1),
    (8, 10, 10),
    (7, 11, -1),
    (0, 2, 0),
    (3, 3, 3)
]

for x, y, expected in test_cases:
    actual = choose_num(x, y)
    assert actual == expected, f"For inputs {x} and {y}, expected {expected} but got {actual}"
``` 

The test drive code tests the function with different inputs to ensure it returns the expected results.
