```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    min_even = max(x, y) // 2
    
    if max_even >= min_even and max_even % 2 == 0:
        return max_even
    elif max_even < min_even:
        return -1
    else: 
        return choose_num(min_even, max_even)
``` 

The code aims to find the biggest even integer within the range of two given positive numbers `x` and `y`. It follows these steps:
1. Finds the midpoint between `x` and `y` - `(x + y) // 2` which falls halfway through the interval.
2. Loops through the upper and lower bounds of the interval with a recursive call, checking if the midpoint is smaller than the maximum even number possible within the range `(max(x, y) // 2)` and if it is, returning the maximum even number, otherwise, returning -1. 

In cases where there is no even number in the range, the function returns -1 to signify the absence of such a number. 

The logic for the `choose_num` function revolves around the idea of recursion, utilizing something called the "midpoint optimization" to efficiently pinpoint the largest even integer within a given range. 

#### Understanding Midpoint Optimization: 

Midpoint optimization is a technique used for solving computational problems efficiently. By finding the midpoint of the range, we can reduce the search space by half with each recursive call. This approach is especially beneficial when dealing with large ranges where the target number could be anywhere within that interval. 

However, it's crucial to note that this approach may not work if the range contains an odd million (as millions are not divisible by 2). Additionally, if the range contains a prime number, the time complexity could increase. 

#### Testing:
We can test the `choose_num` function using a simple unit test:
```python
# Test choosing an even number
 assert choose_num(12, 15) == 14, "Should return 14"

# Test choosing an odd number
 assert choose_num(13, 12) == -1, "Should return -1"
```

These test cases ensure that the function works correctly for both odd and even input numbers and handles the edge case of not returning an even number when one does not exist in the given range.
