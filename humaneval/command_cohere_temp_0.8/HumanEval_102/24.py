```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = max(x, y)
    floor_even = max_even - 1
    if floor_even % 2 == 0:
        return floor_even
    else:
        return -1
```

This Python script defines a function choose_num, which takes two positive numbers x and y as input and returns the largest even integer that falls within the range of [x, y], or -1 if no such number exists. Here's how it works:
1. The function starts by calculating the maximum value of the two input numbers, which is done using the max function and storing it in the variable max_even. This ensures that the subsequent operations work with the largest possible number. 
2. Then, it calculates one less than the maximum even integer, which is stored in the variable floor_even. The goal is to check the largest possible even number that's less than or equal to the maximum of x and y. 
3. Finally, the function checks if floor_even is an even number. If it is, it means there is an even number within the desired range, so the function returns floor_even. Otherwise, if floor_even is odd, there are no even numbers in the range, so the function returns -1 to indicate that there is no such number. 

This algorithm efficiently solves the problem by directly calculating the largest even integer within the given range and returning it, or indicating the absence of such a number with -1.
