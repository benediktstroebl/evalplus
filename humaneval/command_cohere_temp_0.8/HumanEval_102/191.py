```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    min_even = max(x, y) // 2
    if max_even >= min_even and max_even % 2 == 0:
        return max_even
    elif max_even < min_even or max_even % 2 != 0:
        return -1
```

The Python script defines a function choose_num, which takes two positive numbers x and y as input and returns the largest even integer that falls within the range of [x, y]. The function first calculates the midpoint between x and y, then iteratively checks if the midpoint is an even integer, and if it's within the minimum and maximum bounds of the provided range. If it meets these conditions, it returns the even integer; otherwise, it returns -1. This approach efficiently solves the problem and ensures the function returns the largest even integer within the specified range.
