```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    max_even += max_even % 2
    if max_even >= x and max_even <= y:
        return max_even
    elif max_even > y:
        return -1
    elif max_even < x:
        return -1
```

The function starts by finding the maximum even integer in the range [x, y] inclusive, which is (x + y) // 2 + (x + y) % 2. If the maximum even integer is within the range [x, y], it returns the maximum even integer; otherwise, it returns -1. Given the constraints of the problem, the approach takes advantage of the fact that the maximum even integer within a range that includes odd numbers will always be at the midpoint of the range, and if that midpoint is not within the range, then there are no even integers in the range. 

Here is a simple test suite that can be used to validate the function:
```python
def test_choose_num():
    assert choose_num(12, 15) == 14
    assert choose_num(13, 12) == -1
    assert choose_num(2, 11) == 10
    assert choose_num(100, 100) == 98
``` 

To test the function, you can simply call `test_choose_num()` and the assert statements will check if the output of the function for a given input is correct.
