```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    max_even += max_even & 1
    return max_even if max_even in range(x, y + 1) else -1
```

The function starts by finding the mathematical middle point between `x` and `y` and then adjusting it upwards if it's not an even number. It then returns the adjusted number if it's within the range `[x, y]` inclusive, or -1 if it's not. The logic efficiently identifies the largest even number within the specified range without exhaustive search.
