```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = max(x, y)
    floor_even = max_even - 1
    if floor_even % 2 == 0:
        return floor_even
    else:
        return -1
```

The function `choose_num()` takes two integers `x` and `y` as parameters. It first finds the maximum even integer in the range by using the expression `max(x, y)`. It then calculates the maximum even integer excluding the limit values by subtracting 1 from the maximum even integer (`max_even - 1`). If this value is even, it is returned. Otherwise, the function returns -1. 

This solution allows for a clear understanding of the logic and is concise in implementation. Let's break down the solution further to provide more clarity:
1. **Maximizing Even Integer**: The first step towards finding the largest even integer lies in ascertaining the maximum even integer within the bounds of the given range. This is efficiently achieved using the expression `max(x, y)`, which retrieves the higher of the two input numbers.
2. **Excluding Limit Values**: To ensure the exclusion of the limit values in the analysis, the function performs a subtraction of 1 from the previously calculated maximum even number (`max_even`). This adjustment is pivotal, as it facilitates the identification of the largest even integer within the range, bypassing the limitations, and thereby optimizing the result.
3. **Validation of Maximum Even**: After the adjustment, the value is checked to determine if it is even. Employing the condition `floor_even % 2 == 0` assesses whether the number is divisible by 2, thereby confirming its evenness. If the criterion is met, this value is returned, representing the largest even integer within the specified range.
4. **Absence of Valid Maximum**: In the event that the maximum even integer is not divisible by 2, indicating that there is no even integer within the range, the function thoughtfully returns -1. This serves as an informative indicator signifying the absence of a valid even number in the range. 

This solution effectively addresses the problem statement and provides a clear and direct approach to solving it.
