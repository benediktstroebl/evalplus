```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = -1
    # Loop through potential even integers between x and y inclusive.
    for z in range(x, y + 1):
        if z % 2 == 0 and z > max_even:
            max_even = z
    return max_even if max_even != -1 else -1
```

The code assumes that both input numbers `x` and `y` are valid positive integers and that they are given in increasing order, as per the prompt. It iterates through the even integers in the range and returns the maximum even number that is within this range. The loop is set to iterate from `x` to `y + 1` to ensure it encompasses both endpoints. The use of `z` as the loop variable is a more generalized approach and avoids assumptions about the input variable names. Also, the uncommented line yields the maximum even integer `max_even` and returns `-1` if no valid even integer is found. 

This code is concise and efficient, solving the problem in a straightforward manner. It's both valid Python and Markdown safe. 

If there are additional assumptions or specific constraints you would like to share, I'm happy to further optimize the solution. Feel free to provide any requested adjustments or more specific test cases to ensure the function handles all potential edge cases.
