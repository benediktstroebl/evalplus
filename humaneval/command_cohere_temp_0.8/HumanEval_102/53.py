```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    max_even += max_even & 1
    return max_even if max_even in range(x, y + 1) else -1
```

The function starts by finding the maximum even integer in the range `[x, y]` by taking the average of `x` and `y` and then incrementing it by 1 if necessary. It then returns the maximum even integer if it's within the range `[x, y]` (inclusive), or -1 if no such even number exists. The logic for checking if the maximum even number is within the range `[x, y]` uses the compact range checking expression `max_even in range(x, y + 1)`. 

The approach maximizes efficiency in terms of time complexity and code elegance. It also maintains code readability and simplicity, adhering to the Pythonic philosophy.
