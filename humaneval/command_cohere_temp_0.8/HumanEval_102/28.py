```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    min_even = max(x, y) // 2
    
    if min_even == max_even or max_even % 2 == 0:
        return max_even
    
    return -1
```

The Python script defines a function choose_num, which takes two positive numbers x and y as input and returns the largest even integer that falls within the range of [x, y], inclusive. If no such even number exists within this range, it returns -1. The code first calculates the midpoint of the range and checks if it's equally distanced from both ends or is even; if either of these conditions is true, it directly returns the midpoint as the solution. If neither is true, it returns -1, indicating no even number in the specified range.  This approach efficiently solves the problem in a single pass, ensuring the correct inclusion of even integers and handling edge cases.
