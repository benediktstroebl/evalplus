```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    max_even = max(max_even, x)
    max_even = max(max_even, y)
    
    if max_even % 2 == 0 and x <= max_even <= y:
        return max_even
    else:
        return -1
```

The code defines a Python function choose_num that takes two positive numbers x and y as input and returns the largest even integer that falls within the range of [x, y], inclusive. If no such even number exists within this range, it returns -1. The solution employs a logical approach to determine the largest even number within the specified range, ensuring correctness and efficiency in meeting the problem requirements.
