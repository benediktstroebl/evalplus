```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    min_even = max(x, y) - 1
    return max(max_even, min_even) if max_even >= min_even and max_even % 2 == 0 else -1
```

The function takes two positive numbers `x` and `y` as input and returns the biggest even integer that falls in the range `[x, y]`, inclusive. If no such number exists, it returns -1. 

When `x` is greater than `y`, the biggest even number would be halfway between `x` and `y`, rounded down. This is because odd numbers increase as we move from `x` to `y`, and the biggest even number that can be found has to be the one before the pivot to odd numbers. This is why the function uses `(x + y) // 2` to find the biggest even number between `x` and `y`. 

In the case where `x` and `y` are identical or adjacent even numbers, the function will correctly identify the biggest even number by taking the greater of `(x + y) // 2` and `max(x, y) - 1`.

The special case of no even number in the range is handled by further checking if the calculated max_even is not less than the min_even and also not an even number, in which case it returns -1.
