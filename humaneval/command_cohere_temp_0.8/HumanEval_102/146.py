```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    min_even = max(x, y) // 2
    return max(max_even, min_even) if max_even >= min_even and max_even % 2 == 0 else -1
```

The Python script defines a function choose_num, which takes two positive numbers x and y as input and returns the largest even integer that falls within the range of [x, y], inclusive. The function first calculates the midpoint of the range and checks if it's an even number and larger than or equal to the smallest even integer in the range. If those conditions are met, it returns the max_even; otherwise, it returns -1.
