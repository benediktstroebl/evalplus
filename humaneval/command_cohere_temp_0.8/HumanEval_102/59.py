```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    min_even = max(x, y) // 2
    
    if max_even >= min_even and max_even % 2 == 0:
        return max_even
    elif max_even < min_even or max_even % 2 != 0:
        return -1
    else:
        return choose_num(max_even + 1, y)
```

The function `choose_num()` takes two positive numbers `x` and `y` as input and follows the process below:
- Initially, we compute the 'middle' value `(x + y) // 2` between `x` and `y`.
- Then, we discover the smallest even integer occurring in the range `[x, y]` and assign it to the variable `min_even`. The expression `max(x, y) // 2` effectively discovers the smallest even integer between `x` and `y`.
- If the 'middle' value is bigger than or equal to the minimal even number and is also even (`max_even % 2 == 0`), it denotes that there is at least one even integer in the range `[x, y]`. Consequently, we return the maximum even number.
- If the 'middle' value is smaller than the minimal even number or isn't even, it indicates that there are no even numbers in the range. In this case, we recursively call `choose_num()` with the new range `[max_even + 1, y]`. This process keeps going until an even number is found or the range is invalid. Ultimately, if no even number is found in the enlarged range, we return -1.
