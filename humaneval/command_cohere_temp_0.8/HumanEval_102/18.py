```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    max_even += max_even & 1
    return max_even if max_even in range(x, y + 1) else -1
```

The code defines a Python function choose_num that takes two positive numbers x and y as input and returns the largest even integer that falls within the range of [x, y], inclusive. If no such even number exists within this range, it returns -1. The process involves finding the midpoint between x and y, then incrementing it by 1 if it's odd to make it the largest even integer in the range. This adjusted value is returned, unless it's outside the range, in which case -1 is returned.
