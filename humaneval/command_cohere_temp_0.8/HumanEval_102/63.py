```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = -1
    try:
        max_even = max(x, y, key=lambda n: (-n % 2, n))
    except ValueError:
        pass
    return max_even
```

The function `choose_num()` takes two positive numbers `x` and `y` as input and returns the largest even integer that falls in the range `[x, y]`, inclusive. If no even number exists within this range, it returns -1. 

Here's how the function works:
1. The function starts by initializing `max_even` to -1, which serves as the default output if no valid even number is found in the range.
2. It then uses a `try...except` block to find the maximum even number in the range `[x, y]`. The `max` function is used to find the maximum value, but with a custom key function (`lambda n: (-n % 2, n)`) to prioritize even numbers first.
3. If a `ValueError` is raised during the max calculation (due to invalid input or no even numbers in the range), the `except` block catches it and proceeds to return -1. 

This approach ensures that the code handles all possible scenarios, including edge cases, and adheres to the problem statement's guidelines.
