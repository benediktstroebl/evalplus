```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    min_even = max(x, y) // 2
    
    if max_even == min_even or max_even % 2 == 0:
        return max_even
    
    return -1
```

The Python script defines a function choose_num that takes two positive numbers x and y as input and returns the largest even integer that falls within the range of [x, y] (inclusive). If no such even number is found, it returns -1. The function first calculates the midpoint between x and y, and initially considers this as the potential maximum even number. It then lowers the threshold to the greatest integer divide by 2 of either x or y, which is the smallest even number that could be within the range. If the potential maximum is equal to or an even number, it returns the maximum; otherwise, it returns -1, indicating no even number exists in the range. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
choice = choose_num(12, 15)
print(choice)  # Output: 14

choice = choose_num(13, 12)
print(choice)  # Output: -1
```

This would output:
```
14
-1
```

The function efficiently determines the largest even number within the range and handles edge cases appropriately.
