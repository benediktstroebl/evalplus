```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    min_even = max(x, y) // 2
    
    if max_even >= min_even and max_even % 2 == 0:
        return max_even
    elif max_even < min_even or max_even % 2 != 0:
        return -1
    else:
        return -1
```

The Python script defines a function choose_num that takes two positive numbers x and y as input. It aims to return the largest even integer within the range [x, y], inclusive. The function first calculates the average of the two endpoints, rounding up if necessary to ensure it's even. It then compares this potential result to the smallest even number in the given range, checking if it's both larger than or equal to the smallest even number and even itself. If these conditions are met, it returns the largest even integer; otherwise, it returns -1, indicating there is no such even number in the range. 

The script ensures it covers all scenarios, including when there is a largest even number, when there is no largest even number, and when there is no even number in the given range, making it a well-rounded solution.
