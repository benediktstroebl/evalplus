```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = max(x, y)
    floor_even = max_even - 1
    if floor_even % 2 == 0:
        return floor_even
    elif x == y:
        return -1
    else:
        return choose_num(x, floor_even) if floor_even >= x else choose_num(floor_even + 1, y)
```

The code defines a function `choose_num` that takes two positive numbers `x` and `y` as input and returns the largest even integer that falls within the range `[x, y]`, or -1 if no such number exists. 

It achieves this by:
1. Determining the maximum value between `x` and `y` and storing it in `max_even`.
2. Calculating the preceding even integer less than or equal to `max_even` and storing it in `floor_even`.
3. If `floor_even` is even and within the provided range, it is returned.
4. If `x` and `y` are equal, it returns -1 since no valid even integer can be found.
5. If `floor_even` is not even and within the range, it recursively calls itself with the parameters `x` and `floor_even` to find the solution.
6. If `floor_even` is not even but outside the range, it recursively calls itself with the parameters `floor_even + 1` and `y` to find the solution.

This recursive approach ensures that the correct largest even integer within the range is found and handled appropriately.
