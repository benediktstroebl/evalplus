```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    min_even = max(x, y) // 2
    if max_even >= min_even and max_even % 2 == 0:
        return max_even
    elif max_even < min_even or max_even % 2 != 0:
        return -1
```

The Python script defines a function `choose_num` that takes two positive numbers `x` and `y` as input. It aims to return the largest even integer within the range `[x, y]`, inclusive. If no such number exists, it returns -1. The solution employs a logical approach:
1. The `max_even` variable is calculated as the average of `x` and `y` divided by 2, representing the midpoint of the search range.
2. The `min_even` variable is determined as the maximum even integer value below or equal to the midpoint, ensuring that the search range is narrowed to the lower half of the interval.
3. The function checks if `max_even` is both greater than or equal to `min_even` and even. If this condition is met, it returns `max_even` as the solution.
4. If the `max_even` value is less than `min_even` or is odd, meaning no valid even number exists in the range, the function returns -1 to indicate no valid solution. 

Overall, the code efficiently solves the problem by systematically checking the even numbers within the range and returning the largest even integer if it exists, and -1 otherwise.
