```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = max(x, y)
    floor_even = max_even - 1
    if floor_even % 2 == 0:
        return floor_even
    else:
        return -1
```

This Python script defines a function choose_num, which takes two positive numbers x and y as input and returns the largest even integer that falls within the range of [x, y], or -1 if no such number exists. Here's how it works:
1. The function starts by calculating the maximum value of the two input numbers, x, and y, using the max function, and stores it in the variable max_even.
2. The function then subtracts 1 from max_even, which is done to account for the inclusive nature of the range specification in the problem statement. This value is stored in the variable floor_even.
3. The function then checks if floor_even is an even number by checking if the difference between floor_even and its closest larger integer (floor_even + 1) is equal to 1. If it is, then floor_even is an even number, and the function returns it. Otherwise, no even number exists in the specified range, so the function returns -1. 

This solution efficiently determines the largest even integer within the range and handles cases where no even number exists in the range.
