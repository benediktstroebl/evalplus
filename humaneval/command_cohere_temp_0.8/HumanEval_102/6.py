```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = max((z for z in range(x, y+1) if z % 2 == 0), default=-1)
    return max_even
```
The code defines a Python function choose_num that takes two positive numbers x and y as input and returns the largest even integer that falls within the range of [x, y], inclusive. If no such even number exists in the specified range, it returns -1. This is achieved by using a generator expression (z for z in range(x, y+1) if z % 2 == 0), which creates an iterable of even numbers within the range [x, y+1]. The max function is then applied to this generator expression, finding the largest even number. The default parameter set to -1 ensures that if no even number is found, the function returns -1.
