```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    min_even = max(x, y) // 2

    if max_even >= min_even and max_even % 2 == 0:
        return max_even
    elif max_even < min_even or max_even % 2 != 0:
        return -1
    else:
        return -1
```

The Python script defines a function choose_num that takes two positive numbers x and y as input and returns the biggest even integer that falls within the range of [x, y], or -1 if no such number exists. It works in the following way:
1. The function calculates the 'midpoint' of the interval, (x + y) / 2, which is the average of x and y.
2. It also finds the smallest even number within the range, which is determined by halving the maximum of x and y, (max(x, y) // 2).
3. Then the function checks if the 'midpoint' is bigger than or equal to the smallest even number and if it's also even.
4. If the condition is met, the function returns the 'midpoint'.
5. If the 'midpoint' is smaller than the smallest even number or is not even, -1 is returned.
6. The final case handles the scenario where the 'midpoint' is even but smaller than the smallest even number, in which case -1 is also returned. 
This algorithm efficiently determines the largest even integer within the range and appropriately returns -1 when there is no such number.
