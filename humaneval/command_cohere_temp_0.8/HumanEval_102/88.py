```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    min_even = max(x, y) // 2
    
    if max_even >= min_even and max_even % 2 == 0:
        return max_even
    elif max_even < min_even or max_even % 2 != 0:
        return -1
    else: 
        return choose_num(x, max_even) if x != max_even else choose_num(max_even, y)
```

The Python script defines a function `choose_num` that takes two positive numbers `x` and `y` as input. It aims to find the largest even integer within the range inclusively bounded by `x` and `y`. The function follows these steps:
1. It calculates the midpoint between `x` and `y` with `(x + y) // 2`. 
2. It then finds the smallest even integer that divides the midpoint (`max(x, y) // 2`) or the initial smallest even integer, whichever is larger. 
3. If this even integer is within the range and is the largest possible even number, it returns it. 
4. If no such even number exists, it attempts to find the largest even number in the range from `x` to this midpoint (`choose_num(x, max_even)` if `x` isn't already the midpoint) or from the midpoint to `y` (`choose_num(max_even, y)` if the midpoint isn't `x`). It recursively calls itself in the latter case. 
5. If no valid even number is found within the range, it returns -1. 

The function utilizes recursion to efficiently traverse the range and find the desired even number while satisfying the given constraints.
