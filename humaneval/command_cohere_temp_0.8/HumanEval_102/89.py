```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    min_even = max(x, y) // 2
    
    if max_even == min_even or max_even % 2 == 0:
        return max_even
    else:
        return -1
```

The Python script defines a function `choose_num` that takes two positive numbers `x` and `y` as arguments. It aims to return the largest even integer that falls within the range `[x, y]`, inclusive. If no such even number is found in the range, it returns -1.

The script employs logic to efficiently identify the largest even number within the specified range. It calculates the midpoint of the range `(x + y) // 2` and also computes the minimum even number that's either equal to or less than the midpoint `(max(x, y) // 2)`.

If the midpoint is equal to the minimum even number or if the midpoint is even, it returns the midpoint as the largest even number in the range. Otherwise, if the midpoint is odd, it indicates that there is no even number in the range and thus, it returns -1. 

This approach efficiently solves the problem while maintaining a clear understanding of the scenario's constraints and variables.
