```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    min_even = max(x, y) // 2
    if max_even >= min_even and max_even % 2 == 0:
        return max_even
    elif max_even < min_even or max_even % 2 != 0:
        return -1
```

The Python script defines a function choose_num, which takes two positive numbers x and y as input and returns the largest even integer that falls within the range of [x, y], inclusive. The function first calculates the midpoint between x and y, then iterates through the lowest and highest even integers between the midpoint and x or y, whichever is smaller. The function returns the largest even number within this range, or -1 if no such number is found.
