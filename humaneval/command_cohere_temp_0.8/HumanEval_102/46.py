```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = max(x, y)
    floor_even = max_even - 1
    if floor_even % 2 == 0:
        return max_even
    elif floor_even == x or floor_even == y:
        return -1
    else:
        return choose_num(x, floor_even) if floor_even >= x else choose_num(floor_even, y)
```

The code defines a function `choose_num` that takes two positive numbers `x` and `y` as input and returns the largest even integer that falls within the range `[x, y]`, inclusive. If no such even number exists within the range, it returns -1. 

The script leverages Python's `max` function, which can take multiple arguments, to determine the maximum even number between `x` and `y`. It then decrements this maximum even number by 1, referred to as `floor_even`, to potentially identify an even number boundary within the range. 

If `floor_even` is even, it's returned as the largest even number within the range. If `floor_even` is equal to either `x` or `y`, indicating an odd boundary, the function returns -1, as there are no even numbers within the range. 

Lastly, if `floor_even` is odd but greater than or equal to `x`, the function recursively calls itself with the new range `[x, floor_even]`, effectively moving the boundary to the right to capture the next largest even number. If `floor_even` is greater than `y`, an analogous recursion is performed with the range `[floor_even, y]`. 

In summary, the function employs a combination of maximum value identification, boundary analysis, and recursion to determine the largest even integer within the range `[x, y]`, and returns -1 if no such even number exists. 

Note: The code includes inline comments to elucidate the logic of each step for better understanding.
