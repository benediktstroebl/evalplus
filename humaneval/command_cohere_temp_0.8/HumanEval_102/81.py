```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    min_even = max(x, y) // 2
    
    if max_even >= min_even and max_even % 2 == 0:
        return max_even
    elif max_even < min_even or max_even % 2 != 0:
        return -1
    else: 
        return choose_num(max_even + 1, y)
```

The function `choose_num()` takes two positive numbers `x` and `y` as arguments. It aims to find the largest even integer within the range `[x, y]` and handles the edge cases appropriately. 

Here's how it works:
1. The variable `max_even` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `x` and `y` by 2. This represents the largest even number that can possibly be within the given range.
2. The variable `min_even` is determined as the maximum even number between `x` and `y` which is calculated by dividing the maximum of `x` and `y` by 2. 

Then, the function checks the following conditions:
- If `max_even` is greater than or equal to `min_even` and is also even (`max_even % 2 == 0`), it means an even number within the desired range exists, so the function returns `max_even`.
- If `max_even` is less than `min_even` or is not even, there is no even number in the range or the range is too large, so the function returns `-1` to indicate that no valid even number exists. 

If the condition to return `-1` is not met, the function recursively calls itself to narrow down the search range by considering odd numbers only, starting from `max_even + 1`, until it finds the largest even number within the range `[x, y]`.
