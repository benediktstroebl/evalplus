```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    max_even += max_even & 1
    return max_even if max_even in range(x, y + 1) else -1
```

The code defines a Python function choose_num that takes two positive numbers x and y as input and returns the largest even integer that falls within the range of [x, y] (inclusive). If no such even number exists within the specified range, it returns -1. The function employs a bit of arithmetic and the modulus operator % to determine the largest even number within the range, accounting for the possibility that the midpoint of the range may not be even, and then adjusts it to the next highest even number. It subsequently checks if this calculated value falls within the inclusive range [x, y] and returns it if possible; otherwise, it returns -1. This method ensures an accurate solution for the specified problem.
