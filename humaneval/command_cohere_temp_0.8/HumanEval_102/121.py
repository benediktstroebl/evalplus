```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    min_even = max(x, y) // 2
    
    if max_even == min_even or max_even % 2 == 0:
        return max_even
    else:
        return -1
```

The Python script defines a function choose_num that takes two positive numbers x and y as input and returns the largest even integer that falls within the range of [x, y], inclusive. If no such even number exists within this range, it returns -1. The code employs a logical approach to solve this problem by calculating the midpoint between x and y and then comparing it to the lower limit of the range, which is either x or y. If the midpoint meets either of these conditions: (1) it is equal to the maximum even integer or (2) it is even, meaning it can be divided into two equal halves, it is returned as the solution. If not, -1 is returned because no eligible even number is found within the specified range.  This approach efficiently solves the problem while adhering to the specified conditions.
