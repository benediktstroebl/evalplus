```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    min_even = max(x, y) // 2
    return max(max_even, min_even) if max_even >= min_even and max_even % 2 == 0 else -1
```

The Python script defines a function choose_num, which takes two positive numbers x and y as input and returns the largest even integer that falls within the range of [x, y], inclusive. The function first calculates the midpoint of the range and optimizes it to be the maximum even integer in this range. It then checks if the maximum is valid by comparing it to the smallest even integer in the range [x, y], ensuring it isn't lower. If the condition is met, the function returns the maximum even integer; otherwise, it returns -1 to indicate no such even number exists in the range. 

This approach efficiently determines the largest even integer within the given range, considering odd and even ranges separately while still meeting the criteria of the problem statement.
