```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    min_even = max(x, y) // 2
    
    if max_even >= min_even and max_even % 2 == 0:
        return max_even
    elif max_even < min_even:
        return -1
    else: 
        return choose_num(max_even, min_even)
``` 

The function employs a recursive approach to search for the biggest even integer in the range between x and y. It first calculates the midpoint between x and y, checking if it's an even number and within the range. If it meets these conditions, it returns the midpoint. If the midpoint is not within the range or not even, it continues the recursive process, calling itself with the smaller interval between max_even and min_even, ensuring oddness doesn't interfere with the result. 

This solution is efficient given that the function's runtime is O(log(min(x, y))).

This approach considers the nature of the problem, which requires a recursive exploration of potential solutions. It's a thoughtful and efficient solution. 

Please let me know if you would like me to explain any part of the solution in more detail.
