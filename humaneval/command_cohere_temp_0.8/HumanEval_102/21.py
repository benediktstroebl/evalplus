```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    min_even = max(x, y) // 2

    if max_even >= min_even and max_even % 2 == 0:
        return max_even
    elif max_even < min_even or max_even % 2 != 0:
        return -1
    else:
        return choose_num(x, max_even)
```

The `choose_num` function takes in two positive numbers, `x` and `y`, and returns the largest even integer that falls within the inclusive range between `x` and `y`. If no such even number exists, it returns -1. The algorithm for finding the maximum even number operates by leveraging the knowledge that the range between `x` and `y` encompasses a majority of even numbers. By calculating the midpoint between `x` and `y` and subsequently assessing the lowest and highest possible even numbers within the range, the function is able to ascertain whether a valid even number can be returned. If so, it returns the even number; if not, it recursively operates on the sub-range until a valid even number is found or the base case of a single number is reached.
