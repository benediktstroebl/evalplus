```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    min_even = max(x, y) - 1
    if max_even <= min_even and max_even % 2 == 0:
        return max_even
    elif max_even > min_even:
        return -1
    else:
        return min_even
```
This Python script defines a function choose_num(x, y) that aims to find the largest even integer within the range [x, y], inclusive. If no such integer exists, it returns -1. The function first calculates the average of x and y, rounding down if it's odd. This value is then used as both the upper and lower limit for potential even numbers, with an additional check ensuring the upper limit isn't larger than the lower limit. If this condition is met and the upper limit is even, it's returned as the solution. If the condition isn't met, indicating no even number in the range, the lower limit is returned.
