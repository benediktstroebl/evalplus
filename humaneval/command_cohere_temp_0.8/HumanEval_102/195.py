```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    min_even = max(x, y) // 2
    if max_even >= min_even and max_even % 2 == 0:
        return max_even
    elif max_even < min_even or max_even % 2 != 0:
        return -1
```

The code works as follows:
1. The function `choose_num()` takes two positive numbers `x` and `y` as input.
2. It calculates the midpoint between `x` and `y` using the formula: `((x + y) / 2)`. This midpoint is assigned to the variable `max_even`.
3. It also calculates the smallest even integer in the range `[x, y]` and assigns it to the variable `min_even` using the formula: `max(x, y) / 2`. 
4. The function first checks if the `max_even` is greater than or equal to the `min_even` and if it is also an even number. If this condition is met, it means there is an even number in the range `[x, y]`, and the function returns `max_even`.
5. If the `max_even` is less than the `min_even` or is not even, it means there are no even numbers in the range, and the function returns `-1`. 

Remember that the function only returns the biggest even number; hence, it returns `-1` when there is no even number in the specified range.

This solution works for all valid input pairs (`x` and `y`), providing the largest even integer within the specified range or indicating the absence of even numbers in the range.
