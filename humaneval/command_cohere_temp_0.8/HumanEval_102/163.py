```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = max(x, y) if (x == y) or ((x + y) & 1) else -1
    return max_even
```

The function `choose_num()` takes two integers `x` and `y` as parameters. It first checks if `x` and `y` are equal or if they are both odd or both even, in which case the maximum even number within the range is simply the larger of the two numbers. This is done using the bitwise operator `|` to check if the sum of the most significant bits of the two numbers (which is equivalent to checking if the number is even) is greater than or equal to the maximum of the two numbers. If neither of these conditions is true, meaning there is no even integer in the range, the function returns -1. 

This solution enables you to perform the desired task of finding the biggest even integer within the range efficiently, while also handling the edge cases as outlined in the prompt.
