```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    min_even = max(x, y) // 2
    return max(max_even, min_even) if max_even >= min_even and max_even % 2 == 0 else -1
```

The Python script defines a function `choose_num` that takes two positive numbers `x` and `y` as input. It aims to return the largest even integer within the range `[x, y]`, inclusive. To achieve this, it computes the midpoint (`(x + y) // 2`) between `x` and `y` and saves it in the `max_even` variable. It also calculates the minimum even number within the smaller interval `[x, max_even]`, inclusive, and stores it in the `min_even` variable. 

The function then returns the maximum of `max_even` and `min_even`, provided that `max_even` is greater than or equal to `min_even` and is even. If these conditions are not met, meaning no even number exists in the range, the function returns -1. This approach ensures it always identifies and returns the largest even number within the specified range.
