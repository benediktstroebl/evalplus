```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = max((z for z in range(x, y + 1) if z % 2 == 0), default=-1)
    return max_even
```

The code defines a function choose_num that takes two positive numbers x and y, which returns the largest even integer within the range [x, y] inclusive. If there is no such number in the range, it returns -1. The function employs a generator expression (z for z in range(x, y + 1) if z % 2 == 0) to traverse even numbers between x and y, exploiting the max function's default parameter to identify the largest even number.

To ensure proper functionality, test cases should include scenarios like choose_num(12, 15), which returns 14, and choose_num(13, 12), resulting in -1.
