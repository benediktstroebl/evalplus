```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    max_even += max_even % 2
    if max_even in range(x, y + 1):
        return max_even
    else:
        return -1
```

The code works as follows:
1. The function `choose_num` takes two positive integers `x` and `y` as arguments and returns the largest even integer that falls within the range `[x, y]`, inclusive. If no such even number exists within this range, it returns -1. 
2. The initial step `(x + y) // 2` calculates the middle value of the interval `[x, y]`.
3. The expression `max_even += max_even % 2` is then used to increment the middle value by 2, effectively finding the largest even integer less than or equal to the middle value.
4. The code then checks if this calculated `max_even` value is within the range `[x, y]`. If it is, it returns this even number; otherwise, it returns -1, indicating that no such even number exists in the specified range. 

The function is designed to efficiently compute the largest even number within a given range and handle edge cases appropriately.
