```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    min_even = max(x, y) // 2
    return max(max_even, min_even) if max_even >= min_even and max_even % 2 == 0 else -1
```

The function first tries to find the biggest even number in the range by taking half of the sum of `x` and `y` (assuming that the biggest even number is either at the very top or the very bottom of the range). If that doesn't satisfy the condition of being the biggest even integer in the range, it then checks if the biggest integer divided by two is in the range and is also even, in which case it returns that value. The function returns `-1` if no such number exists. 

Would you like to test this function to see if it passes?
```python
test_cases = [
    (12, 15, 14),
    (13, 12, -1),
    (16, 20, 18),
    (7, 11, -1),
    (30, 10, -1)
]

for x, y, expected in test_cases:
    result = choose_num(x, y)
    assert result == expected
```

This block of code tests the function with different inputs to check if it returns the expected results. Let's see how it performs:
```bash
.
