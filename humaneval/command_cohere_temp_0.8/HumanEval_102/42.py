```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = (x + y) // 2
    max_even = max(max_even, x)
    max_even = max(max_even, y)
    
    if max_even % 2 == 0 and x <= max_even <= y:
        return max_even
    else:
        return -1
```

The code defines a Python function choose_num that takes two positive numbers x and y as input and returns the largest even integer that falls within the range of [x, y] (inclusive). The function first calculates the midpoint between x and y, then updates the midpoint to be the maximum of the midpoint, x, and y. This ensures that the midpoint is the largest even integer within the range. The function then checks if the midpoint is even and falls within the specified range, returning it if it does. If no even number satisfies the conditions, the function returns -1, indicating that no such even number exists in the range.  This algorithm efficiently solves the problem while maintaining a clear and concise structure.
