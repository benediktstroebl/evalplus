```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = max(x, y) if (x == y) or ((x + y) & 1) else -1
    return max_even if (max_even >= x and max_even <= y) else -1

# Test Cases
assert choose_num(12, 15) == 14
assert choose_num(13, 12) == -1
assert choose_num(2, 4) == 2
assert choose_num(100, 200) == 198
```

This function takes two positive numbers, `x` and `y`, and returns the largest even integer that falls within the range `[x, y]`, inclusive. If no such even number exists within this range, it returns -1. The logic for determining the largest even number involves using the properties of odd and even numbers and the `max` function to ensure the correct result is returned.
