```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    max_even = -1
    temp = x
    while temp <= y:
        if temp % 2 == 0:
            max_even = temp
        temp += 1
    return max_even
```

The function `choose_num()` takes two parameters, `x` and `y`, and searches for the biggest even integer that lies in the inclusive range `[x, y]`. It does so by initializing `max_even` to -1 and then iteratively incrementing the variable `temp` from `x` to `y` (inclusive). For each increment, it checks if the current value of `temp` is even. If it is, it updates `max_even` to the value of `temp`, ensuring that the biggest even number seen so far is saved. The process continues until `temp` reaches the value of `y`, at which point the function returns the final value of `max_even`. 

The reasoning is that the biggest even number in the range can be represented as `x`, `x+2`, `x+4`, ..., `y`. As we iterate through the range, we check if each number is even and update `max_even` accordingly. 

If the range does not contain a single even number, the function will return -1, as this is the default return value for not finding a suitable even number. 

This approach is efficient because it linearly traverses the range, and the loop's condition is structured to always find the biggest even number in the range, without the need for explicit `max_val` comparisons. 

The unit tests that would be useful to accompany this function are: 
```python
# Testing choose_num() with positive integers
assert choose_num(12, 15) == 14
assert choose_num(13, 12) == -1

# Testing choose_num() with single-digit numbers
assert choose_num(4, 5) == 6

# Testing choose_num() with 0 as one of the inputs
assert choose_num(0, 10) == 0

# Testing choose_num() with equal inputs
assert choose_num(10, 10) == 10
```

These tests cover scenarios involving different ranges and boundary conditions, ensuring that the function behaves correctly.
