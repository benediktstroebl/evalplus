```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) <= threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function takes a list of floats `numbers` and a float `threshold` as input. It returns `True` if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the given `threshold`, and `False` otherwise. It uses a list comprehension, and the `any` and `zip` functions to perform the necessary checks.  This solution has a runtime equals O(n^2) where n is the length of `numbers`. 
The markdown code block for this script is shown below:
```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    """
``` 

This code block includes the function signature, a brief description of the problem, and example usage that validates the behavior of the function.  These examples show how the function correctly identifies whether or not close elements are in the list within the given threshold.  The first example returns `False` since the numbers `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]` don't have elements that are less than `0.5` apart.  The second example returns `True` because the numbers `[1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]` contain elements that are less than `0.3` apart, specifically `2.0` and `2.8`.  This is the essence of the `has_close_elements` function.
