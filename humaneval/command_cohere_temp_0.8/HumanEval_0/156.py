```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes two arguments; a list of numbers and a threshold and returns a boolean value. It uses the `any` function with a lambda function to check for each pair of numbers if they are closer than the threshold. The lambda function `abs(x - y) < threshold` calculates the absolute difference between two numbers, and the `zip` function pairs each number with the subsequent numbers. The `any` function returns True, if any of the pairs are closer than the threshold, and False, otherwise. 

To test this function, you can use the following code:
```python
test_cases = [
    ([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5, False),
    ([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3, True),
]

for numbers, threshold, expected in test_cases:
    actual = has_close_elements(numbers, threshold)
    assert actual == expected
```

This code provides two test cases, and for each test case, the function `has_close_elements` is called with the corresponding input values. The actual output is compared with the expected output in the `assert` statement, and if the actual output matches the expected output, the test passes. Otherwise, it fails.  This way, you can verify the correctness of the function.
