Here's a Python script that contains a function called has_close_elements, which takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function works correctly and passes the given tests. The code is formatted as a markdown code block:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    """
    pairs = list(zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
    return any(abs(num1 - num2) < threshold for num1, num2 in pairs)

# Tests
numbers_list = [ [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0] ]
thresholds = [0.5, 0.3]
expected_results = [False, True]

for i in range(len(numbers_list)):
    assert has_close_elements(numbers_list[i], thresholds[i]) == expected_results[i]
```
The function first zips the list with itself with a step of 1, creating pairs of adjacent elements. It then uses an any filter to check if there's any pair for which the difference is less than the threshold, returning the result accordingly. 

To test the function, the code creates a couple of test lists, together with the expected results for each, and uses an assertion to compare them with the function's output.
