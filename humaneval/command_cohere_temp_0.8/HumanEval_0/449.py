```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as parameters. It uses the `any()` function with a generator expression to check if any elements in the list are closer than the threshold to each other. The generator expression, `x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`, creates a list of tuples by merging pairs of elements from the list using the `zip()` function and checks if the difference between the pairs is less than the provided threshold.
