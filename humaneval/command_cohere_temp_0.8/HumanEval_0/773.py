```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as parameters, it uses the `any` function with a lambda function to check for each pair of numbers in the list, except for the first one (as it compares with the second one and onwards), whether their difference is less than the threshold, if any of these conditions are `True`, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.  This solution follows the specification you provided in the prompt as it checks if there are any close elements in the list relative to each other with a given threshold and returns a boolean indicating their presence. 
This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the usage of `any` with a lambda function in python, which results in an implicit loop that iterates over all combinations of elements in the list.  Would you like to verify if it satisfies your needs? If not, please provide more information on how you'd like to see it improved.
