Here's a Python script that contains a function called has_close_elements, which takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function works correctly and passes the given tests. The code is formatted as a markdown code block:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    """
    numbers.sort()
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i] < threshold:
            return True
    return False

# Tests
assert not has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
```

The function first sorts the input list of numbers. Then, it iterates through the sorted list, and checks each consecutive pair of numbers. Using an appropriate threshold, the algorithm can efficiently identify whether there are any closely adjacent numbers in the list that deviate from the threshold.
