```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold value as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function examines each element in the list in relation to the other elements, making it O(n^2) in time complexity, but this can be improved to O(n) with a loop and the `close_elements` function.

To test this script, you can create a list of numbers and a threshold and pass them into the function to see if it returns the correct value. 

For example:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_threshold = 1
print(has_close_elements(my_list, my_threshold))  # Output: False
``` 

This would print `False` because none of the elements in `my_list` are closer to each other by more than `1`. 

This approach is also reusable and easier to understand, and efficiently solves the problem at hand.
