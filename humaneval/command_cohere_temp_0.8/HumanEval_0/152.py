```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function checks if any elements in the list are close to each other by using a list comprehension with a `zip()` function, which checks all pairs of elements in the list. The `any()` function then determines if any of these pairs are within the threshold. 

This approach ensures that the time complexity is O(n^2), with `n` being the length of the input list, as it checks each pair of numbers in the list. 

To pass tests, you can use Python's `unittest` module like this:
```python
import unittest

class TestHasCloseElements(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_close_elements(self):
        self.assertTrue(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))
    def test_not_close_elements(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This will run the test once when you run the file. 
If you want to run the test again, you can change the `if __name__ == '__main__'` statement to `if True`, and add the following line at the end of the file:
```python
import unittest
```

This will allow you to run the tests every time you make changes to the file.
