Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
The `has_close_elements` function takes two arguments; a list of numbers `numbers` and a threshold `threshold`. It uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if any element in the list is closer to the next element than the `threshold`. The generator expression `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` pairs each element with the next element in the list to compare, and `abs(x - y)` calculates the absolute difference between the pairs. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))
```
This would produce the following output:
```
False
True
```

This script solves the problem in a straightforward manner and should provide a clear and correct answer for the given input scenarios.
