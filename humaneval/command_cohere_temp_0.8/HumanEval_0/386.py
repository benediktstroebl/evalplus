Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
The `has_close_elements` function takes two arguments; a list of numbers and a threshold for comparison. It uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check for adjacent elements in the list that are closer than the specified threshold. The generator expression, `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`, pairs each element with the subsequent element in the list (skipping the last element). The `abs` function then calculates the absolute difference between the pairs, and the `any` function checks if any of these differences are less than the given threshold. 

To test this function, you can use the following Markdown code block with example cases:
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```

The first example indicates that there are no adjacent elements in the list 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 closer than 0.5 to each other, so the function returns `False`. In the second example case, the function returns `True` since there is an element (2.0) that is closer than 0.3 to the next element (3.0) in the list [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0].  You can replace the `has_close_elements` function with the above code to solve the problem and pass the test cases.  This approach makes the code more concise and readable, avoiding the use of excessive explicit loops.  It also allows for the possibility to add more test cases in the future.
