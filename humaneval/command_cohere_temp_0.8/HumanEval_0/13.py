```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` checks if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer to each other than the provided threshold. It uses a list comprehension, which is a powerful feature that allows you to make complex transformations on list values. In this case, the transformation checks if the difference between each number and the following one is less than the given threshold. The any function is used to check if any element in the list satisfies this condition. The function returns True if such elements are found, and False otherwise.

To use this function, you can provide a list of numbers and a threshold value as input. For example:
```python
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # Output: False
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # Output: True
```

This will return False since no number is closer than 0.5 to another in the first example, and True in the second example, where numbers 2.0 and 2.8 are closer than 0.3 to each other.
