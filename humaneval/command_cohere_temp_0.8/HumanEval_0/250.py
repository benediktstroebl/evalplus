```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function checks if any elements in the list are close to each other by calculating the absolute difference between each element and the subsequent element, using the `zip()` function to iterate through pairs of elements in the list, and the `any()` function to check if any of these differences are less than the given threshold. 

To test this algorithm, you can call the function with different inputs, asserting the returned value against your expected outcome, as shown below: 
```python
assert not has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
```

This approach uses the `zip()` function to create iterable tuples of adjacent elements in the list, which allows us to calculate the difference between each pair. We then use the `any()` function to check if any of these differences are less than the threshold, which is a more efficient and concise approach.
