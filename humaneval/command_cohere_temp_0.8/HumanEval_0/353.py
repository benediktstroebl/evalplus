```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function takes in a list of numbers and a threshold value as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function implements an efficient algorithm that checks the closeness between adjacent elements in the list by utilizing the 'any' and 'zip' functions to iterate through all pairs of adjacent elements in the list, subtracting one element from the other and checking if the difference is less than the threshold. 
To test this function, you can call it with a variety of input tests, such as: 

```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```
This would return 'False' for the first case and 'True' for the second, as expected.
