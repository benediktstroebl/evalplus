```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` uses the `zip` function to pair up consecutive elements in the list of numbers. It then checks if their difference is smaller than the given threshold. The `any` function is used to determine if any of these differences are smaller than the threshold, returning `True` if so. If not, it returns `False`.

To test this algorithm, you can call this function with different lists of numbers and thresholds and assert the returned value against the expected one. 

For example:
```python
assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) == False
assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) == True
```

NOTE: The function uses Python's `typing` module to allow for type-checking on the function input, making the code more robust and enabling better editing in modern IDEs.  
This way, it is ensured that `numbers` is a list of numbers and that `threshold` is a floating-point number. 
However, since the script only checks for the type of the arguments and not their correctness, the function might still work when passed invalid arguments.  If you want to ensure the input follows the assumptions, you may want to add additional tests to validate the inputs.  For instance, you could test has_close_elements with unacceptable arguments like [] or [1,2,3], and assert them to raise an error.  Also, you could add a test that checks the function with valid inputs but invalid types, e.g. has_close_elements([1,2,3], 2), and assert it to return False.  These tests are important to ensure your function handles incorrect inputs gracefully, which is a good practice in coding.  They also serve to avoid misunderstandings with users who are not familiar with the typing module and its type-checking mechanism in Python.
