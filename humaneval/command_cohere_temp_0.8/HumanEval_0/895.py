```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function checks for the condition using a generator expression, which can be more memory efficient for large lists compared to the list comprehension.  This approach reduces the memory footprint since itertools don't store the whole list in memory, and thus makes it compatible with large lists. 

To further illustrate the functionality, here are some example outputs:
```
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```
