```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, it uses the `any` function to check if there are any elements in the list that are closer than the threshold to each other. The `any` function returns `True` if there are elements that are closer than the threshold, and `False` otherwise.  This solution is concise and uses built-ins from the Python language making it easily readable and usable. 
The function assumes that the list is not empty and that the threshold is a positive number. 

To check that the function works as expected you can run the following tests:
```python
test_has_close_elements = ({'numbers': [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 'threshold': 0.5, 'expected': False},)
test_has_close_elements += ({'numbers': [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 'threshold': 0.3, 'expected': True},)
```
These tests check the function with two different sets of parameters, in the first test case the list of numbers contains three elements and the threshold is 0.5, meaning that the function should return `False` as there are no numbers that are close to each other with a threshold of 0.5. In the second test case, the list contains numbers with repetitions and the threshold is 0.3, the function should return `True` as some numbers in the list are repeated and they are closer to each other than the threshold. 

To run these tests you can use the following code: 
```python 
import unittest

class TestHasCloseElements(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_has_close_elements(self):
        self.assertEqual(has_close_elements(numbers=test_has_close_elements[0]['numbers'], threshold=test_has_close_elements[0]['threshold']), test_has_close_elements[0]['expected'])
        self.assertEqual(has_close_elements(numbers=test_has_close_elements[1]['numbers'], threshold=test_has_close_elements[1]['threshold']), test_has_close_elements[1]['expected'])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
This will run the tests and assert that the function has_close_elements returns the expected values.
