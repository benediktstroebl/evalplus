```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function checks if there are any consecutive elements in a list of numbers that are closer together than a given threshold. It uses a generator expression (`zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`) to pair each element with the following element in the list. The `any()` function then checks if any of these pairs have an absolute difference less than the given threshold. 

Here is a simple test to validate the script:
```python
test_list = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
test_threshold = 0.5

expected_result = False

result = has_close_elements(test_list, test_threshold)

print(result)
```

Expected output:
```
False
```

If you would like to see more test cases for this function, let me know. I can provide additional input tests that cover different scenarios and edge cases. Let me know if you need assistance with anything else!
