```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function relies on the use of a generator expression, which allows for short-circuit logic and yields expressions that involve the absolutize difference of neighboring elements in the list. 

To ensure performance viability, it is imperative to note that the function only operates on the list's first element and all subsequent elements, as checking for closeness necessitates comparing each element to its neighbor. 

Furthermore, the function is designed to work with any Python version that supports type hinting and the generator expression, thus, ensuring cross-version compatibility. 

This could be useful when cleaning up data where you need to identify and remove redundant closely clustered data points.
