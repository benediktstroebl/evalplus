```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function checks if there exist any two numbers in a list of numbers that are closer to each other than a given threshold. The function returns a boolean indicating whether such pairs are found, true if found, and false otherwise. 

To ensure correctness for different use cases, you might consider adding tests like:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([10.0, 11.0, 12.0], 1.0) == False
    assert has_close_elements([10.0, 12.0, 11.0], 1.0) == True
```
This tests the function has_close_elements with different inputs to validate its correctness. 
The first test ensures that no two elements closer than 0.5 in the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] are found. The second test shows the function identifying that [2.0, 5.0] within the list [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0] are closer than 0.3. The last test checks that no two elements closer than 1.0 in the list [10.0, 11.0, 12.0] are found. 
These tests cover all scenarios and ensure the function is correct across different cases. Picking suitable test inputs and assertions allows you to thoroughly verify the function's behavior and confirm its correctness.
