Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes two arguments:
1. `numbers`: A list of floating numbers
2. `threshold`: A floating number used to compare the absolute differences between the elements of `numbers`

It checks if the list contains elements that are closer to each other than the given threshold. 

You can test this function using the following Markdown code blocks:
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```

This technique uses a generator expression (`zip`, `abs`, and `filter`) to efficiently check the elements of the list for closeness.
