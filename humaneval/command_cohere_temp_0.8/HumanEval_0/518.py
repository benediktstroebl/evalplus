```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` uses the `zip` function to iterate through pairs of elements in the list of numbers. It checks if the absolute difference between each pair of numbers is smaller than the given threshold. The `any` function then checks if any of these differences is smaller than the threshold and returns `True` accordingly. If no differences are smaller than the threshold, it returns `False`.

This solution is efficiently solved using pairs and a threshold check, resulting in an O(n) solution, where n is the length of the input list `numbers`. 

A usage example would be:
```python
>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
``` 

This would yield the expected results based on the problem statement.
