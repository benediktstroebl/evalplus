```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function `has_close_elements` checks if there are any two numbers in the list `numbers` that are closer to each other than the given `threshold`. It uses a list comprehension, which is a powerful feature in Python, that enables us to make a new list based on the values of an existing one. In particular, `any()` is a built-in Python function that checks if any element in a list returns `True` for a given function, and `zip()` combines successive pairs of lists together as tuples. This is achieved by using a `for` loop, where the loop variable `a` is for the first element in the pair and `b` is for the second element in the pair, based on the list `numbers` and `numbers[1:]`. 

For example, given the list `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]`, the loop would generate the pairs as follows:
- `((1.0, 2.0), (2.0, 3.0))`
If the threshold were 0.5, the close-ness check would fail for both pairs, and as a result, the function would return `False`. On the other hand, if we executed this with a threshold of 0.3, the function would return `True` for the second pair since `2.0` and `2.8` are closer than `0.3`.
