```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` checks if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer than the specified threshold using a generator expression and the `any` function. 

To see how close two elements in a list are, the generator expression, `x - y < threshold`, is used for every element `x` and its subsequent element `y` in the list. In the case of the first element, `y` will be the second element, and so on. 

Once you have the generator expression, you can now use the `any` function to check if any of the conditions are `True`. If any of these conditions evaluate to True, it means there are two elements in the list that are close to each other. 

This approach ensures readability and efficiency in checking for close elements in a list. Let's say the given list is `[1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]` and the threshold is `0.3`. The function will return `True` because the elements `2.0` and `2.8` are closer than `0.3` to each other.
