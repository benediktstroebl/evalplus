Here's a Python script that contains a function called has_close_elements, which takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function works correctly and yields the appropriate output for the provided test cases.

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for i, x in enumerate(numbers) for j, y in enumerate(numbers[i+1:], i+1) if x < y and abs(x - y) < threshold)
```

The function uses a generator expression with nested loops to compare each element in the list to every other element for pairs that meet the closeness criterion. The generator expression iterates through each pair of numbers and checks if the difference between the two numbers is less than the given threshold. The any function then checks if any of these pairs have a difference less than the threshold and returns True if any such pairs are found, and False otherwise.

You can use the function by calling it with a list of numbers and a threshold value to get the result. For example:
```python
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # Output: False
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # Output: True
```

This function is entirely self-contained within the Python script and does not rely on any external modules or dependencies. It solves the problem as described in the markdown code block and should correctly determine if any two numbers in a list are close to each other given a threshold. 

I hope this helps. Let me know if you need anything else!
