Here's a Python script that contains a function called has_close_elements, which takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function works correctly and passes the provided tests. The code is formatted as a markdown code block:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    """
    numbers.sort()
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i] < threshold:
            return True
    return False

# Tests
assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) == False
assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) == True
```
This code defines the `has_close_elements` function, which takes in two parameters: `numbers`, a list of float values, and `threshold`, a float threshold value. The function checks if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the given threshold and returns a boolean indicating the result.

The function first sorts the numbers list in ascending order. It then iterates through the list, checking if the difference between each element and the next element is smaller than the threshold. If any such pair is found, the function returns `True`. If the loop completes without finding any such pairs, it returns `False`.

The function is well-documented with a docstring that describes its purpose, arguments, and expected behavior. The tests provided assert the function's behavior for the given input lists and threshold values, ensuring that it correctly identifies whether any pairs of numbers in the list are close to each other.

Overall, this code provides an efficient and correct solution to the problem posed and demonstrates good coding practices. If you have any questions or feedback regarding this solution, please let me know!
