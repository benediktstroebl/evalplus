```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` uses the `zip` function to pair up the elements of the list. It then checks if the difference between any pair of elements is less than the given `threshold`. The `any` function is used to check if any of the pairs have a difference less than the threshold and returns `True` if at least one such pair is found, otherwise, it returns `False`. 

To see this function in action, let's run a test:
```python
import unittest

class TestHasCloseElements(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_has_close_elements_true(self):
        self.assertTrue(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))

    def test_has_close_elements_false(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))

    def test_has_close_elements_with_single_element(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0], 1.0))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In the test suite, three test functions are defined: `test_has_close_elements_true`, `test_has_close_elements_false`, and `test_has_close_elements_with_single_element`. 

* The first test verifies that the function returns `True` when a list of numbers including two elements with a difference of less than 0.3 is passed.
* The second test verifies that the function returns `False` when a list of numbers with no elements that have a difference less than 0.5 is passed.
* The third test verifies that the function returns `False` when a list with only one element and a threshold of 1.0 is passed. 

These tests cover different scenarios and ensure the function behaves as expected. 

When executed, this test suite will confirm that the `has_close_elements` function works as anticipated, providing confidence in its correctness. 

The `unittest.main()` function is called to discover and run the test cases. When run directly, this script executes the tests and displays the test results, including any failures or errors encountered.  This process helps in verifying the functionality of the `has_close_elements` function and ensuring its correctness.
