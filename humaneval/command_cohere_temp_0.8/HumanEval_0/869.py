```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of float values and a threshold value as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two elements in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function examines each element in the list in relation to the other elements and determines whether any two elements deviate from each other by less than the specified threshold. 

To test this algorithm, you can create a simple unit test that provides sample lists and thresholds and checks whether the function returns the correct boolean values for those cases. 

For example:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    # List with singular element; threshold = 0.5; none of the elements is doubled, so False
    assert not has_close_elements([1.0], 0.5)

    # List with singular element; threshold = 0.5; half of the element is equal to itself, so True
    assert has_close_elements([2.0], 0.5)

    # List with two elements; threshold = 0.3; the second element is the double of the first, so True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0], 0.3)

    # List with three elements; threshold = 0.5; the third element is the double of the first, so True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 4.0], 0.5)

    # List with multiple elements; threshold = 0.4; no two elements are closer than 0.4, so False
    assert not has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], 0.4)

    # List with multiple elements; threshold = 0.25; the second and fifth elements are closer than 0.25, so True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 3.0, 5.0, 6.0], 0.25)

``` 
The test_has_close_elements function verifies different scenarios regarding the proximity of elements in the list, confirming the correctness of the `has_close_elements` function with each test case.
