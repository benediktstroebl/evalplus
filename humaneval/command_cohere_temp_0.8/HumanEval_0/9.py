```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs. It uses the `any()` function with a generator expression to check if any elements in the list are closer than the threshold to each other. The generator expression, `x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` iterates through the list of numbers, pairs them up, and checks the difference between each pair against the threshold. 

This solution is concise and elegant, directly addressing the problem statement without unnecessary complexity. It demonstrates the power of Python in leveraging its syntax and built-in functionalities to succinctly solve practical problems. 

This code can be tested against the following examples:
```python
import unittest

class TestHasCloseElements(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_has_close_elements(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))
        self.assertTrue(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))

    def test_has_close_elements_with_different_lists(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 5.0], 1.0))
        self.assertTrue(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 2.0, 4.0, 5.0], 1.0))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This test suite contains two test functions. The first test function, `test_has_close_elements`, checks the function behavior against the given examples in the problem statement. The second test function, `test_has_close_elements_with_different_lists`, ensures that the function behaves correctly with different lists and thresholds. 

The `unittest.main()` function is used to discover and run the test cases. When the script is run directly, it will execute the tests and report any failures or errors.  This testing framework helps to validate the correctness of the solution and ensure it adheres to the problem requirements.
