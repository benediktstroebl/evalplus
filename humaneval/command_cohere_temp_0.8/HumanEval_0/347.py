```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This Python script defines a function called `has_close_elements`, which takes two arguments: a list of floating numbers called `numbers` and a threshold value also defined as `threshold`. 

The function returns `True` if there are any pairs of numbers in the list whose absolute difference is less than the threshold, and `False` otherwise. 

It uses a `zip` operation to iterate over the list of numbers, checking each element against the subsequent elements in the list, and finally uses the `any` function to determine if there are any close elements within the threshold. 

This solution allows you to efficiently determine if there are any closely spaced elements in the list, as per the problem definition. 
```python
# The following code can be added to properly verify the functionality of the function
from pytest import approx
import numpy as np 

def test_has_close_elements():
    np.random.seed(0)
    nums = np.random.random(size=10)
    threshold = 0.7 
    result = has_close_elements(nums, threshold)
    assert result == approx(True) 

    nums = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
    threshold = 0.5 
    result = has_close_elements(nums, threshold)
    assert result == approx(False) 

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_has_close_elements()
```
The `test_has_close_elements` function uses the `pytest` framework to check the functionality of the `has_close_elements` function. It generates random numbers for testing purposes and verifies whether the result of the function is correct when compared to the known `True` value. 

Moreover, it checks a specific threshold to validate whether the function's output is incorrect. 

The final `if __name__ == "__main__":` block executes the test function when the script is run directly. 

To effectively uncover potential issues and edge cases, rigorous testing is essential. This test suite aims to thoroughly evaluate the functionality of the `has_close_elements` function. 
You can adjust and add more tests to the test suite in order to obtain more test coverage and ensure the correctness of the function according to your requirements.
