```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of floats and a threshold as parameters. It uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if any two elements in the list have a difference that is less than the threshold. The generator expression, `abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`, iterates through pairs of elements in the list using the `zip` function, calculating the absolute difference between each pair, and checks if the difference is less than the threshold.

To see how close two numbers in the list are, the `zip` function pairs up the numbers with the list of numbers starting from the second. For example, given the list `[1, 2, 3]`, `zip([1, 2, 3], [2, 3])` is equal to `[(1, 2), (2, 3)]`. 

This way, the function can efficiently check if there are any pairs of elements in the list that are close to each other according to the given threshold.

The function returns `True` if such pairs are found, indicating that there are close elements in the list, and `False` otherwise.
