```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes two arguments; a list of numbers and a threshold. It uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if any element in the list is closer to any other element than the threshold. The generator expression, `x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` iterates through pairs of elements in the list using the `zip` function and checks if the difference between consecutive elements is less than the threshold. 

To see how close two elements need to be for the function to return `True`, you can change the threshold value. 

This solution is efficient and does not require additional imports or dependencies.
