Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
The `has_close_elements` function takes two parameters: a list of numbers `numbers` and a threshold `threshold`. It uses the `any` function to check if any element in the list is closer to its subsequent element (without considering the first element) than the `threshold`. The `zip` function is used to iterate over pairs of adjacent elements in the list, and the `abs` function is used to calculate the absolute difference between each pair. The threshold is used to determine whether two adjacent elements are considered "close". 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))
```
This would output:
```
False
True
```
This is consistent with the original problem statement.
