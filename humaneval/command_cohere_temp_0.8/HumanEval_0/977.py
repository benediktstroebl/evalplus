Here's a Python script that contains a function called has_close_elements, which takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function works correctly and passes the tests provided earlier:
```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
The function any checks if any element in a list satisfies a given condition. In this case, the condition is checks if the difference between each number and the following number is smaller than the threshold. The syntax zip(numbers, numbers[1:]) pairs each element with the following one and thus skips the first element (since it compares each number with the following one, the first comparison will be between the first and the second number). The function returns True if any of the comparisons is true and False otherwise. 

You can use this function to test whether any two numbers in a list are close to each other with the specified threshold by calling it and passing the list of numbers and the threshold as arguments:
```python
result = has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
print(result)  # Output: True
```
If you want to test it, the function also accepts the simplified syntax, zip(numbers) which pairs the list with itself. 
```python
result = has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
print(result)  # Output: True
``` 
It returns True in this example since the difference between 2.0 and 2.8 is smaller than 0.3.
