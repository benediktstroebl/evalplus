```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` checks if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer than the specified threshold using a zipper. 

To see how the function works let's walk through a sample input:
```python
print(has_close_elements([1., 2., 3., 4., 5.], 1.))
```
The function will return `False` for the following reasons:
- The list `[1., 2., 3., 4., 5.]` contains 5 elements and when iterating over all unique couples in the list using the `zip` function, we get `[(1., 2.), (2., 3.), (3., 4.), (4., 5.)]`.
- Out of the four couples, only `(2., 3.)` returns a difference `<=1)` which is the threshold. Therefore the condition `any(x - y < 1 for x, y in zip(l, l[1:]))` is `True` and the function returns `False`. 

Thus, the function returns `False` since only one pair of elements has a difference less than or equal to the threshold. 

If the threshold is less than or equal to 0, the function will return `True` as at least one couple will have a difference of less than or equal to 0, which is always true.
