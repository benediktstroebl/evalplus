```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold value as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

To properly evaluate the closeness of elements in the list, the function `any` is used in combination with a generator expression, created by the syntax `for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`. This expression pairs each element in the list with the following element and checks if the difference between the two is less than the given threshold. 

The `any` function then evaluates if any of these pairs satisfy the required condition and returns `True` if so, and `False` otherwise. 

This approach ensures efficiency and readability, satisfying the problem statement while maintaining a clear and concise code structure.
