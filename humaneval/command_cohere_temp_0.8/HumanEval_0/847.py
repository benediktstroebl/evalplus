```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes two arguments; a list of numbers and a threshold. It uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if any of the differences between adjacent elements in the list are less than the threshold. The `zip` function is used to iterate over pairs of adjacent elements in the list. Note that the function assumes that the list contains at least two elements.

To simulate the expected behavior of the problem statement, two examples are provided below:
```python
# These lines are optional and illustrate usage of the function
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```
