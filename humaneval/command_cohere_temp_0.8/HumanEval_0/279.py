```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function checks if there are any consecutive elements in a list of numbers who are closer than the product of a given threshold. It uses a list comprehension, which iterates through all pairs of elements in the list with the exception of the first element. For each pair, it checks if the absolute difference between the two elements is smaller than the threshold. If any of these comparisons is true, the function returns True, otherwise, it returns False. 
The function is called with a list of numbers and a threshold, and it returns a boolean indicating whether any elements in the list are close to each other as specified by the threshold. In our example, it returns True for the first call and False for the second.
