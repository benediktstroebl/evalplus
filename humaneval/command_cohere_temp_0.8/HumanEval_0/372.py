```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` uses the `zip` function to iterate through pairs of elements in the list of numbers. It checks if the absolute difference between each pair of elements is smaller than the given threshold. The `any` function then checks if any of these differences are smaller than the threshold and returns True if so, and False otherwise. 

To ensure that the function has close elements appropriately, let's create a test suite with the following tests:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([10.0, 11.0, 12.0], 1.0) == False
    assert has_close_elements([10.0, 12.0, 11.0], 1.0) == True
```

This test suite covers a variety of cases to ensure the function `has_close_elements` works appropriately with the correct edge cases. 
The first test ensures that the function identifies correctly that numbers with a threshold of 0.5 do not have any close elements. The second test ensures the function identifies correctly that some numbers in the list have close elements smaller than the threshold of 0.3. The last test ensures that the function correctly identifies closer elements when the list of numbers is in ascending order and a threshold of 1.0 is given. 

To execute the test suite, we can use Python with the `unittest` module, which comes with Python's standard library and is present in the environment. 

To run the tests, you can use the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python -m unittest test_has_close_elements
```

Alternatively, you can run the script manually in your Python environment by importing the `unittest` module and invoking the `test_has_close_elements` function:
```python
import unittest
unittest.main(test_names=['test_has_close_elements'])
``` 

Once you run the tests, Python's `unittest` module will run the test suite and report whether the tests pass or fail.
