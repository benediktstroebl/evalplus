```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function relies on using a generator expression alongside the `any` function to determine if there are any elements within a list that have a difference less than the provided threshold.

To test this script, you can provide sample inputs and verify that the function returns the expected outputs. Here is an example:
```python
# Test case for has_close_elements function
def test_has_close_elements():
    # List with 3 elements with distance threshold of 0.5
    num_list = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
    thresh = 0.5
    expected = False
    actual = has_close_elements(num_list, thresh)
    assert actual == expected, f"Expected {expected}, but got {actual}"

    # List with 3 elements with distance threshold of 0.3
    num_list = [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
    thresh = 0.3
    expected = True
    actual = has_close_elements(num_list, thresh)
    assert actual == expected, f"Expected {expected}, but got {actual}"

test_has_close_elements()
```

This test code uses the `has_close_elements` function with a list of three elements and a threshold of 0.5, and verifies that the function returns `False`. Then it re-uses the function with a different list and threshold to verify it returns `True`. 

Please feel free to add more test cases or any additional functionality you may require.
