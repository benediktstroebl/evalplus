Here's a Python script that contains a function called has_close_elements, which takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function works correctly and passes the provided tests. The code is formatted as a markdown code block:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    """
    numbers.sort()
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i] < threshold:
            return True
    return False

# Tests
numbers_list = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
threshold = 0.5

print(has_close_elements(numbers_list, threshold))  # False

numbers_list = [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
threshold = 0.3

print(has_close_elements(numbers_list, threshold))  # True
```

The function has_close_elements will soon be explained and elaborated on. The two tests that are included here mirror the use cases that were presented in the problem statement and are used to validate the function. When compared to the second test, the first test demonstrates how the method correctly identifies when there are no two nearby numbers.

To make the function more understandable and manageable, it is organized using the following steps:
1. The list of numbers is sorted using the sort() method, which is required for this challenge and makes parsing the list faster.
2. Using a loop to iterate through the sorted list, the function searches for any nearby numbers. In order to save computational cost, the loop is terminated after one pass through the list.
3. Using the return statement, the function ends when a match is discovered.

This strategy improves the function's readability and simplifies the code while maintaining the desired functionality.
