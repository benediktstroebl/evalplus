```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function relies on using a generator expression along with the `any` function to check for the condition within the list elements.

To test this function, you can call it with different lists of numbers and thresholds, asserting the expected boolean output. Below is a test calling the function with the examples provided in the problem:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    assert not has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
```

This test validates that the function `has_close_elements` behaves accordingly to the given problem description.
