```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as parameters, it uses the `any` function with a lambda function to check for each pair of numbers in the list, whether they are closer than the threshold. The `zip` function is used to create pairs of adjacent numbers in the list. The `abs` function is used to compare the distance between the pairs of numbers with the threshold. It returns `True` if any of these pairs has a distance smaller than the threshold. 

To test this function, you can use the following markdown code block:
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```

This tests the function with two different cases, first one passes the threshold of 0.5 to the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], these numbers are relatively far from each other, so the function returns `False`. While in the second test, we run the function with a threshold of 0.3 and a list of numbers [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], and the function returns `True` because the distance between 2.0 and 2.8 is less than 0.3.
