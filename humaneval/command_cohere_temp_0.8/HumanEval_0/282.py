Here's a Python script that contains a function called has_close_elements, which takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function works correctly and passes the provided tests. The code is formatted as a markdown code block:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    """
    numbers.sort()
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i] < threshold:
            return True
    return False

# Tests
numbers_list = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
threshold = 0.5

print(has_close_elements(numbers_list, threshold))  # False

numbers_list = [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
threshold = 0.3

print(has_close_elements(numbers_list, threshold))  # True
```

The function has_close_elements will soon be explained and differentiated. Below are the two example use cases taken from the problem statement that are still included in the script to demonstrate the functionality of the function. By sorting the list of numbers, the function checks each pair of adjacent elements in the list. The function returns True if any two adjacent elements differ by less than the threshold. Otherwise, it returns False. 

The function has_close_elements is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem using a efficient algorithm and passes the corresponding tests. It can be used directly to check if there are any close elements within a given list of numbers and threshold.  It's also important to ensure that your code is well-organized, correctly commented, and has appropriate safeguards to handle edge cases and potential errors.  If so, it may be the right time to certify your code and make sure it adheres to the specified requirements and, if necessary, adjust the unit tests to check a variety of edge cases and scenarios.  If you want to improve the functioning of this function, do not hesitate to ask.
