```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of floats and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two elements in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. For example, given the input `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]` and a threshold of 0.5, the function would return `False` since there are no elements within a distance of 0.5 or less. However, for the input `[1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]` and a threshold of 0.3, the function would return `True` since the elements 2.0 and 2.8 are closer than 0.3.

To validate the correctness of the function, the following tests could be used:
```python
test_cases = [
    ([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]], 0.5, False),
    ([[1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]], 0.3, True),
    ([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]], 1.0, False),
    ([[1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 3.0]], 0.5, True),
]

for numbers, threshold, expected in test_cases:
    assert has_close_elements(numbers, threshold) == expected
```

Here, we use a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains a list of numbers, the threshold, and the expected boolean result. We then iterate through each tuple in the list, passing its contents to the `has_close_elements` function and the expected result to the `assert` statement for validation.
