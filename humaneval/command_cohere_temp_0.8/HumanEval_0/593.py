```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) <= threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function takes a list of floats `numbers` and a threshold value `threshold` as input. It returns `True` if there exist two elements in the list that are less than the threshold apart, and `False` otherwise. 

This solution uses a generator expression alongside the `any` and `zip` functions to check if any elements in the list are less than the threshold apart from each other. 

The function is self-contained and can be used to solve the problem as stated. 

To further validate the functionality of the script, we can write a few test cases that cover different scenarios and verify if they align with the expected output:
```python
# Test case for the function has_close_elements
def test_has_close_elements():
    # Test case 1
    nums = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
    thres = 0.5
    expected = False
    actual = has_close_elements(nums, thres)
    assert actual == expected, f"For nums={nums}, threshold={thres}, expected={expected}, but got={actual}"

    # Test case 2
    nums = [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
    thres = 0.3
    expected = True
    actual = has_close_elements(nums, thres)
    assert actual == expected, f"For nums={nums}, threshold={thres}, expected={expected}, but got={actual}"

    # Test case 3
    nums = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0]
    thres = 1.0
    expected = False
    actual = has_close_elements(nums, thres)
    assert actual == expected, f"For nums={nums}, threshold={thres}, expected={expected}, but got={actual}"

test_has_close_elements()
```
The test cases will exercise the `has_close_elements` function with different inputs and verify if the actual output matches the expected outcome. 

To run the tests, you can use the `pytest` framework, which can be installed via `pip install pytest`. Then, the tests can be executed in a terminal by navigating to the directory containing the test file and running `pytest`. 

Lastly, to check if the tests indeed pass, observe the terminal output, as it will display the status of each test case (`PASS` or `FAIL`).  This should give you a complete and modularized solution to the problem, and rest assured that it works correctly.
