```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs and checks if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function returns `True` if such pairs are found, and `False` otherwise.

This solution employs the `any` function to determine if there are elements fulfilling the criterion, backed by the conjunction (`and`) of logical AND operation, which is used in the predicate, checking the condition for each pair of elements in the list. The `zip` function is used to create pairs of nearby elements in the list, and the subtraction operation subtracts the second element from the first element in each pair, which is then compared to the threshold. 

To see it in action, you can call the function with the example inputs provided in the problem statement like this: 
```python
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))
```

The output will be as expected:
```
False
True
```
