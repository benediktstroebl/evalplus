```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, it uses the `any` function to check if there are any elements in the list that are closer than the threshold to each other. The `any` function returns `True` if there are at least two numbers that are closer than the threshold and `False` otherwise. 

To test this function, you can use the following inputs:
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```

This should return `False` in the first case and `True` in the second case, respectively. 

The function is self-contained and does not rely on any external libraries or modules, making it easy to integrate into any project that needs this functionality.
