```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` uses the `any` function to check if there are any elements in the list that are less than the `threshold` apart, it achieves this by subtracting each element from the rest in the list and using the `zip` function to couple them correctly. 

To pass the given tests, the function must check if the difference between the elements is less than the threshold, so the first test would be `False` and the second one would be `True`.
