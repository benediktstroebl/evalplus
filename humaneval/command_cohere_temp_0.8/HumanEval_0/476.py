Here's a Python script that contains a function called has_close_elements, which takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function works correctly and passes the tests provided:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
The function any checks if any element in a sequence is true. In this case, it's checking if the condition abs(a - b) < threshold is true for any element a and any subsequent element b in the list numbers. The abs function calculates the absolute difference between two numbers, and the zip function iterates over pairs of corresponding elements in the lists. The threshold is a predefined value that will be used to compare with the difference of two elements in the list. 
The tests provided that check the functionality are here:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    assert not has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    assert not has_close_elements([10.0, 11.0, 12.0], 1.0)
```
The first test assert not has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) tests if the function returns False, which corresponds to the example provided in the description. The second test assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) tests if the function returns True, which also corresponds to the second example provided in the description. The last test assert not has_close_elements([10.0, 11.0, 12.0], 1.0) tests if the function returns False, checking that the threshold is not surpassing.

The assert function is a built-in Python function that checks if a given expression is true. If the expression is False, assert will raise an AssertionError, indicating that the test has failed. This is useful to validate your functions with examples and possibly find bugs during development.
