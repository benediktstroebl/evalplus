```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes two arguments; a list of numbers and a threshold value. It uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if there is any difference between adjacent elements in the list that is less than the threshold. The `zip` function is used to iterate over the list of numbers, returning adjacent elements in the list paired together. The `x - y` expression calculates the difference between the paired elements `x` and `y`.

Here is an example usage of the function from the original prompt:
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
``` 
The function is encapsulated and provides a clear understanding of its purpose based on the code structure and name, aiding future developers in understanding the intent.
