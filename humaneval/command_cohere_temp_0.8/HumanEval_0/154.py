```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) <= threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function employs a zipper operation, provided by the `zip` function, to compare each number in the list to every other number sequentially. The `any` function then checks if any of the comparisons are within the threshold, returning the boolean result. 

This approach enables the function to efficiently solve the problem without any additional dependencies.
