```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` uses the `zip` function to pair up elements of the list `numbers`, and checks if their differences are smaller than the given `threshold`. The `any` function is then used to determine if any of these differences are smaller than the threshold. 

To test this algorithm, you can use the following tests:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([10.0, 10.001, 20.0, 30.0], 1.0) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], 2.0) == False
```

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, from lists where close elements exist, to lists where elements are not close to each other.  This way, you can ensure that the function `has_close_elements` works correctly for different cases.  If you have additional test cases, it would be advisable to add them to increase test coverage and confirmatory checks.  This can help uncover any potential problems or edge cases that may not be handled correctly.
