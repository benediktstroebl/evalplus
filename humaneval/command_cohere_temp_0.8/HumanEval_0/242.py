```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This Python script defines a function called `has_close_elements`, which takes two arguments: a list of floating numbers called `numbers` and a threshold value also defined as `threshold`. 

The function returns `True` if there are any pairs of elements in the list whose absolute difference is less than the threshold, and `False` otherwise. 

It uses a `zip` statement to iterate through pairs of elements in the list, and the `any` function to check if any of the pairs have an absolute difference less than the threshold.

This solution is efficient since it uses Python's built-in algorithms for searching for elements and comparing values, achieving a time complexity of `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the length of the input list.

To see the function in action, you can call it with a specific list and threshold, and it will return either `True` or `False` depending on whether there are number pairs within the threshold. 

For example, calling the function like `has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) ` will return `True` because there are elements whose difference is less than 0.3, for example, `2.0` and `2.8` are closer than 0.3. 

If you call the function like `has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) `, it will return `False` because no elements are closer than 0.5 to each other.
