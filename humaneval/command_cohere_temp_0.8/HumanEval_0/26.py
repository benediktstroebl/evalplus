```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

To efficiently check if any close elements exist in the list, we utilize list comprehension and use the `any` function to check if the condition is met. The `zip` function is used to iterate through pairs of adjacent elements in the list, and the difference between each pair of elements is compared to the threshold. If any of these differences is smaller than the threshold, the function returns `True`, indicating that there are closely spaced elements in the list. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This approach allows the function to efficiently solve the problem and provide the desired outcome.  The function can be tested with various inputs and thresholds to validate its behavior.
