```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of floats `numbers` and a threshold `threshold` as input. It uses the `any()` function with a generator expression to check if any adjacent elements in the list have a difference less than the threshold. The generator expression, `abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`, iterates through pairs of adjacent elements in the list and checks if their absolute difference is less than the threshold. If any of these comparisons are True, the `any()` function will return True, indicating that there are close elements in the list. Otherwise, it will return False.
