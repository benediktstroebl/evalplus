```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function employs a generator expression, `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`, to pair each number in the list with every subsequent number. The `any` function then checks if any element of this list of pairs has a difference less than the given threshold.

To see how to test this function, you might consider adding test cases to a separate file called `test_has_close_elements.py` with the following content:
```python
import has_close_elements

def test_has_close_elements():
    assert has_close_elements.has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) == False

def test_has_close_elements_with_close_elements():
    assert has_close_elements.has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) == True
```

To run these tests, you can use the `pytest` framework, which can be done by first installing the library with `pip install pytest`, and then running the tests with `pytest test_has_close_elements.py`.

This approach provides a robust and reusable way to check if any two numbers in a list are close to each other more than a given threshold.
