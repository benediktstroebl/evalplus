```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of floats `numbers` and a threshold `threshold` as input. It uses the `any()` function with a generator expression to check if any element in the list differs from its neighboring element by less than the threshold. The generator expression, `x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` checks successive pairs of elements in the list, starting with element pairs `(x, y)` with `x` being the first element and `y` being the second element in the list. The criterion to determine whether two consecutive elements are close is that their difference is less than the threshold `threshold`. 

Here is a basic test suite to verify the functionality of the function:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    # Empty list test case
    assert not has_close_elements([], 0.5)

    # List with one element
    assert not has_close_elements([0.1], 0.05)

    # List with two elements
    assert has_close_elements([0.1, 0.2], 0.1)

    # List with three elements
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0], 0.3)

    # List with spatially close elements
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 3.0], 1.0)

    # List with elements spread out
    assert not has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], 1.0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_has_close_elements()
```

The test suite contains several test cases to evaluate the function with different types of input lists and threshold values to verify that the function has_close_elements() correctly checks whether there are elements in the list that are close together.
