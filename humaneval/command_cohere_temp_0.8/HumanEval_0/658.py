```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function checks if the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list is smaller than the threshold.

To confirm that the function works as expected, let's write a test case using Python's built-in `unittest` module:
```python
import unittest

class TestHasCloseElements(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_has_close_elements(self):
        self.assertTrue(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], 1.0))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In the test suite, there are three individual tests (expressed as methods starting with the word `test`) that exercise the `has_close_elements()` function. 

1. First test: `self.assertTrue(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))`: This tests whether the function returns `True` for a list of numbers where the absolute difference between consecutive elements is smaller than the threshold (`0.3`).
2. Second test: `self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))`: This tests whether the function returns `False` for a list of numbers where no two consecutive elements are closer than the threshold.
3. Third test: `self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], 1.0))`: This tests whether the function returns `False` when the threshold is larger than the absolute differences between all consecutive elements. 

The `unittest.main()` function is necessary to run the tests. When you run this script, Python's unittest will run each test method, and then report which tests passed and which failed. 

To check the actual test execution results, please run the Python script. 

This way, you can see how to create tests for a function and execute them to confirm the expected behavior of the function.
