```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold value as inputs. It uses the `any` function to check if there exist two elements in the list that are less than the threshold apart in value. The `zip` function is used to iterate over pairs of elements in the list, and the `x - y` expression calculates the difference between two consecutive elements at each iteration. 

Here is a sample output of the function:
```
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```

This output is consistent with the example provided in the problem statement.
