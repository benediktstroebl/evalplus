```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes two arguments; a list of numbers and a threshold. It uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if any element in the list is closer to any other element than the threshold. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))
```

The function is also annotated with type hints, specifying the type of the input parameter and the return value. 

This type of function demonstrates good Python practices, using a built-in function (`any`) and generator expression for brevity and readability. Let me know if you'd like me to provide additional resources on writing effective Python code or if you have any more questions!
