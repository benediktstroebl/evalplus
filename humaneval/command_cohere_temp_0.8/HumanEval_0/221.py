```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function implements this by using a generator expression, which is a compact way of declaring a logical operation that needs to be performed on all items in a list. 

To ensure that the function behaves as expected, it is recommended to establish unit tests. Below is a markdown code block with example usage and tests to validate the correctness of the function:
```python
threshold = 0.5
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
test_list = [0.6, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0]

# Test case
assert has_close_elements(numbers, threshold) is False

# Test case
assert has_close_elements(test_list, 0.3) is True
``` 
This will ensure that the `has_close_elements` function behaves as expected.
