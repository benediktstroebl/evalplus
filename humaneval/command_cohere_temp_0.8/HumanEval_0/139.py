```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function checks if the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list is smaller than the threshold. 

To test this function, we can create a unit test that provides a list of numbers and a threshold and checks if the function returns the correct boolean value. In this case, the list of numbers [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0] and a threshold of 0.3, the expected result is True. The following code implements this test:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    numbers = [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
    threshold = 0.3
    expected = True
    actual = has_close_elements(numbers, threshold)
    assert actual == expected
```

This test checks if the actual output of the `has_close_elements` function is equal to the expected output.

To run the test, you can use the `pytest` framework, which can be installed via `pip install pytest`. Then, you can run `pytest` in the directory containing the test file. This will run the test and display the test results, which should show that the test passes.  This will run the test and display the test results, which should show that the test passes.
