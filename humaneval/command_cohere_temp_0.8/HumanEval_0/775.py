```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function checks if there are any two numbers in the list `numbers` that are consecutive elements in the list (`numbers[1:]`), and are closer to each other than the given `threshold`. The `any` function is used to check if there are any true results from comparing consecutive number pairs using the `zip` function, as it returns true if at least one comparison returns true. 

This approach is efficient because it only needs to go through the list once to find the target relationships between the numbers.

To pass the given tests, the script should be formatted as follows:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))

# Tests
assert not has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
```

These tests ensure that the function `has_close_elements` behaves as expected with different inputs.
