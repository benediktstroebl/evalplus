```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of floats `numbers` and a threshold `threshold` as input. It returns a boolean indicating whether any two elements in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. It uses a `zip` operation in combination with an `any` function to check if any of the pairs of elements have an absolute difference smaller than the threshold. 

To test this function, you can use the following code:
```python
import unittest

class TestHasCloseElements(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_has_close_elements_true(self):
        self.assertTrue(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))

    def test_has_close_elements_false(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))

    def test_has_close_elements_with_single_element(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0], 0.1))

    def test_has_close_elements_with_empty_list(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([], 0.1))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This test suite contains four distinct tests to verify the functionality of the `has_close_elements` function. Each test highlights a specific scenario and asserts that the function returns the expected boolean value. 

The first test checks the function's correctness when a list containing numbers and the threshold is provided. The next two tests, similarly, check the function's behavior with distinct edge cases such as a list containing only one number and an empty list. 

The tests are contained within the `TestHasCloseElements` class, which is inherited from `unittest.TestCase`. This class provides a set of assertion methods, which can be used to check whether test conditions are satisfied. In this case, the assertion methods are used to check whether certain expected boolean values are returned from the `has_close_elements` function. 

To execute the tests, the `unittest.main()` function is called at the end of the script. This function serves as the entry point for running the tests contained within the script.  When you run the file as a script, the Python test runner loads the test code and runs each test method, and then reports the results, indicating whether the tests passed or failed.  In the event that tests do not pass, the Python test runner will output the test results, providing information about the failed tests so that you can address any problems and update your code as needed.  This helps to validate the correctness of the `has_close_elements` function implementation.
