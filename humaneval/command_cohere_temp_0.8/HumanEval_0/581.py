Here's a Python script that contains a function called has_close_elements, which takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function works correctly and yields the appropriate output for the provided test cases:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for i, x in enumerate(numbers) for j, y in enumerate(numbers[i + 1:], i + 1) if x < y and abs(x - y) < threshold)

# Test cases
assert not has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
```

In this script, the `has_close_elements` function uses a generator expression to iterate through all pairs of elements in the list `numbers`, skipping the first element in each pair because it's not allowed to compare a number to itself. The Pairs that have a distance smaller than the given threshold are detected and passed to the `any` function, which returns `True` if any of these pairs is closer than the threshold and `False` otherwise.  This function will work correctly for the provided test cases.
