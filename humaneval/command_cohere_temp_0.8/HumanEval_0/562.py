```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) <= threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function `has_close_elements` works by checking if there's any pair of elements in the list where the difference between them is less than the given threshold. It does this using a generator expression, which allows us to iterate over pairs of elements in the list and check if the absolute difference between them is less than or equal to the threshold.

We use the `any` function to check if any of these comparisons are true, which returns True if any close elements are found, and False otherwise. 

To run the function, you can use the following calls:
```python
> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```
These examples correspond to the test cases mentioned in the original problem.
