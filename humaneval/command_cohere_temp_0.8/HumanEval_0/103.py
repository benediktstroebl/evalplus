```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function `has_close_elements` checks if there are any two numbers in the list `numbers` that are closer to each other than the given `threshold`. It uses a list comprehension, and the `any` and `zip` functions to find if any element is close (within the threshold) to any other element in the list. 

To use this function, you can import it in your code:
```python
import has_close_elements

# Example Usage:
lst = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
thresh = 0.5

if has_close_elements.has_close_elements(lst, thresh):
    print("True")
else:
    print("False")
``` 
This will output `False` since there are no elements in the list with a difference less than `0.5`. 

Note that you'll need to install `mypy` to run the type checking and `pytest` to run the tests.
