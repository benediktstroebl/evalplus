Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
The `has_close_elements` function takes two arguments; a list of numbers and a threshold. It uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if any element in the list is closer to another element than the threshold. The generator expression, `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`, pairs each element with the subsequent element in the list (skipping the last element). The `abs` function then measures the distance between each pair of elements and checks if it's less than the threshold.

To test this function, you can run the following code:
```python
import unittest

class TestHasCloseElements(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_no_close_elements(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))

    def test_with_close_elements(self):
        self.assertTrue(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
This code will run the `unittest` module, which checks that the `has_close_elements` function is correct with the two tests corresponding to the examples provided in the prompt.  The first test asserts that the function returns `False` when no elements are closer than the threshold, while the second test asserts that the function returns `True` when some elements are closer than the threshold. 
The `unittest.main()` function is necessary to run the tests; otherwise, the script will not execute them.
