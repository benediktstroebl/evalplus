```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

To correctly solve the problem, we utilize a generator expression alongside the `any` function to check if any elements in the list exceed the given threshold.

To test this function, you can call it with various lists and thresholds. For example:
```python
# Test case 1
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # Output: False

# Test case 2
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # Output: True
```

This function will return `True` if any pair of numbers in the list has a difference less than the threshold and `False` otherwise. 

Please note that this approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the necessary pairwise comparisons between all elements in the list. If the list is large, this method may not be very efficient and alternative solutions should be considered.
