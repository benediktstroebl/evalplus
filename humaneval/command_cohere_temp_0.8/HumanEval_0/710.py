```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function examines each number in the list against all other numbers except the first, using the `zip` function to iterate over pairs of numbers, and the `any` function to determine if the condition is met. 

To test this algorithm, you can call the function with various inputs and compare it with the expected output:
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
``` 

The first example returns False, since no two numbers in the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] are less than 0.5 apart. In the second example, the closest distance is 2.0 - 2.8 = 0.2, and thus the function returns True.
