```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

To efficiently check if any close elements exist in the list, the function employs a generator expression (`x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`) to iterate through pairs of elements in the list. The `any` function then checks if any of these pairs have a difference less than the given threshold. 

This implementation has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested iteration over the list via `zip`, which pairs up adjacent elements. It ideally suits sparse lists, but for larger lists, consider sorting the array and applying a sequential scan with binary search, which would improve the time complexity to O(n log n).

This approach provides a straightforward and effective solution to the problem, and the function's behavior is exemplified by the provided tests.  If further customization or optimization is required, you may modify the function to sort the input list before performing the element comparisons.
