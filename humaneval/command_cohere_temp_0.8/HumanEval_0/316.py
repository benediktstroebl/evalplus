```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function examines each pair of numbers in the list using the `zip` function, calculating the absolute difference between each pair of numbers. Using the `any` function, the function determines if any of these differences are less than the threshold. If any are, then it returns `True`, meaning there are close elements in the list; otherwise, it returns `False`.  This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the use of `zip`, but it is an efficient algorithm for this problem.  This code passes the provided tests and behaves as expected, as we can see:
```
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```
