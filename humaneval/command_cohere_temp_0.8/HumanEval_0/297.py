```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, it uses the `any` function with a lambda function to check for each pair of numbers in the list (excluding pairs where both numbers are the same) whether the difference between the numbers is less than the threshold. The `zip` function is used to create pairs of adjacent numbers in the list. The `abs` function is used to get the absolute difference between the numbers in the pair. 

To test this function, you can use the following tests:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    # Basic Test Cases
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) == True

    # Edge Case: Empty List
    assert has_close_elements([], 0.5) == False

    # Edge Case: Single Element
    assert has_close_elements([1.0], 0.1) == False

    # Edge Case: Threshold Equal To Zero
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.0) == True

    # Edge Case: Threshold Greater Than All Differences
    assert has_close_elements([1000.0, 990.0, 995.0], 5.0) == True
```

These test cases cover various scenarios, including basic cases, edge cases, and cases where the threshold is equal to zero or greater than all differences. 
You can copy and paste these tests into a separate Python file with the `pytest` test framework to verify the correctness of the function. Alternatively, you can also use the provided tests to incorporate into your current testing procedures. In addition, you can expand upon these tests according to your specific needs or particular use-case of the `has_close_elements` function.
