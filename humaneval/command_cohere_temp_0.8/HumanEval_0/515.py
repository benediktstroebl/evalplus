```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, it uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if any of the differences between adjacent elements in the list are less than the threshold. The use of `any` reduces noise by checking if any condition is met, hence simplifying the code while maintaining its readability. 

The problem is complemented with automated tests to ensure the correctness of the function under various test cases. These tests are designed to cover different scenarios such as a list with consecutive elements and a list with disparate elements among others.  This approach helps to validate the functionality of the function and ensures that it behaves as expected. 
```python
import unittest

class TestHasCloseElements(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_has_close_elements_consecutive(self):
        self.assertTrue(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))

    def test_has_close_elements_disparate(self):
        self.assertTrue(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))

    def test_has_close_elements_no_close_elements(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 1.0))

    unittest.main()
