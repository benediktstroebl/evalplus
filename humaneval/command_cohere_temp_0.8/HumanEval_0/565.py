```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold value as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

To efficiently check if any two numbers in the list are closer together than the given threshold, we can use the `any` function in combination with a generator expression. The generator expression `x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` iterates through pairs of numbers in the list, subtracting one pair from the other and checking if the result is less than the threshold. The `any` function then checks if any of these comparisons are true, meaning that there is a pair of numbers in the list that is closer than the given threshold.

To test this function, you can create a script with the following code:
```python
import unittest

class TestHasCloseElements(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_no_close_elements(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))

    def test_with_close_elements(self):
        self.assertTrue(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This script creates a test class with two test methods, each testing a different scenario: one with close elements and one without. The `has_close_elements` function is then called with different inputs and the outcomes are compared with expected truthiness values (`True` and `False`) using `self.assertTrue` and `self.assertFalse`. 

The `unittest.main()` function is called to run all the defined test methods. 

When you run this script, the test class is executed, and any tests that fail are reported. This provides a way to confirm that the `has_close_elements` function behaves as expected, helping to ensure the correctness of the code.
