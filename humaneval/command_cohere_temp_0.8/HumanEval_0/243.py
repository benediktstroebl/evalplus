```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function achieves this by using a generator expression, which iterates through unique couples of elements in the list, and checks if the difference between the couple of elements is less than the given threshold.

To test this function, you can call it with various input tests, such as:
```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    'numbers, threshold, expected',
    [
        ([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5, False),
        ([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3, True),
    ]
)
def test_has_close_elements(numbers, threshold, expected):
    result = has_close_elements(numbers, threshold)
    assert result == expected, f"Expected {expected}, but got {result}"
```

This test uses the `pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator to create a list of tests, with the `numbers`, `threshold`, and `expected` parameters being the input, threshold, and expected output for the `has_close_elements` function.  This script will pass the test cases as expected.
