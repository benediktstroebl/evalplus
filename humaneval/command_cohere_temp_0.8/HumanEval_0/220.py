```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function achieves this by using a generator expression, also known as a list comprehension with `zip`, to compare each number in the list with every other number in the list using the absolute value `abs`, which ensures that the comparison is valid for both positive and negative differences. The `any` function then checks if any of these comparisons are true, indicating that some elements in the list are close together within the given threshold. 

To see how this function can be tested, please see the next response. 
Furthermore, this code can be optimized to be more efficient using the `threshold / 2` optimization, which allows pruning cases that are definitely above the threshold. 

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])) or any(threshold > abs(a - b) for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[:-1]))
