```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of floats and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two elements in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function employs a zipper operation, provided by the `zip` function, to compare each number in the list with every other number in the list to check if the difference is less than the threshold. The `any` function then checks if any of these differences are less than the threshold.

To test this algorithm, you can call the function with a variety of lists and thresholds, such as:
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>>  has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```

This will return `False` for the first case and `True` for the second, as expected according to the problem statement.
