```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function relies on the use of a generator expression `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` to iterate through pairs of consecutive elements in the list, and the use of the `any` function to check whether any of these pairs have a difference smaller than the given threshold. 

This solution does not require any additional imports, making it self-contained and easy to use elsewhere. 

To test this function, you can call it with different lists of numbers and thresholds, such as: 

```python
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # Output: False
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # Output: True
``` 

The function is expected to return `False` in the first case and `True` in the second case, as per the problem statement.
