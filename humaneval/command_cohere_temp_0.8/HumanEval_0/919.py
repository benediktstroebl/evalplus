```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) <= threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function examines each pair of numbers in the list using the `zip` function, calculating the absolute difference between each pair of numbers. Using the `any` function, the function determines if any of these absolute differences are less than or equal to the specified threshold, returning the result accordingly. 

To see the behavior of the function, you can use the following tests:
```python
test_has_close_elements = ({
    "input": [1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
    "threshold": 0.5,
    "output": False
}, {
    "input": [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0],
    "threshold": 0.3,
    "output": True
})
``` 
The function is more efficient due to the use of `zip` and `any`, which decreases the complexity from `O(n^2)` to `O(n)` and `O(n)` respectively, where `n` is the length of the input list.
