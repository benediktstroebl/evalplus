```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` uses the `zip` function to pair each element in the list with the following elements. The `any` function then checks if there are any pairs for which the difference is less than the given threshold. 

To ensure this solution meets your requirements, it would be helpful to know the expected inputs and outputs for the problem, as these would inform the tests I can write to validate the function.
