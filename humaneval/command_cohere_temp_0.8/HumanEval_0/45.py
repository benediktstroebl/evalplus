```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function relies on the use of a generator expression, which is a compact way of writing a Python expression that behaves like a function. In this case, the generator expression `any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))` checks if the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list is smaller than the threshold. The `zip` function pairs up the elements of the list, and the `any` function checks for the condition across all possible pairs. 

This approach enables solving the problem in a concise and elegant manner in Python, without needing to explicitly loop over the list and compare elements. 

To validate the functionality of the function, you can use the following tests:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    # Basic Test Cases:
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) == True

    # Edge Case: Empty List
    assert has_close_elements([], 0.5) == False

    # Edge Case: Single Element
    assert has_close_elements([1.0], 0.5) == False

    # Edge Case: Elements Further Apart
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 1.0) == False
``` 

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including valid and invalid inputs, to ensure the function behaves as expected.
