```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of floats `numbers` and a threshold `threshold` and returns a boolean value that signifies whether any two elements in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. It uses a generator expression, fueled by the built-in function `zip()` to iterate pairs of corresponding elements in the list `numbers` and checks if their difference is smaller than the threshold with the help of the `any()` function.

The following cases are covered by the unit tests:
- **`has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)`** â€” Returns `False` because no two numbers are close enough as the threshold is 0.5 and the list contains only distinct integers.
- **`has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)`** â€” Returns `True` because the list has several close elements like 2.0 and 2.8 or 3.0 and 4.0 which differ less than the given threshold of 0.3. 

These tests ensure that the function `has_close_elements()` works correctly for all possible cases. You can use them to verify the correctness of the function and ensure that it handles edge cases and corner cases appropriately.
