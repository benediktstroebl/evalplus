```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function checks if there exist two numbers in a list of numbers that are closer to each other than a given threshold. It does so by using a generator expression, zip, to pair each number in the list with each subsequent number, and then checks if the absolute difference between any pair is less than the given threshold. The any function returns True if any of these comparisons are true and False otherwise. 

To see how this function can be applied to solve the problem, let's examine the example in the docstring:
```python
has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
```
This function will indeed return `False` because in this list of numbers, no two elements are closer to each other by absolute difference less than 0.5. 

On the other hand, for the second example in the docstring, we have:
```python
has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
```
This will return `True` because the absolute difference between the list's second and third elements, 2.8 and 3.0, is less than 0.3. 

This self-contained Python script solves the problem described in the markdown code block. It passes the tests provided in the docstring and is ready to be used independently.
