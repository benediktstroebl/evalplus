```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold value as inputs and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

To correctly solve the problem, we utilize a generator expression, in combination with the `any` function, to efficiently check all pairs of adjacent elements in the list for closeness above the given threshold. 

This implementation allows for a timely solve for large lists, irrespective of their size, whilst maintaining clarity and readability in the code. 

Here is a simple test to verify the functionality of the function:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) == False

test_has_close_elements()
```

This test validates the correctness of our function for two different cases. 

We use the `assert` statement to confirm the expected output of the `has_close_elements` function with the respective test scenarios. 

This approach provides a clear and concise way of verifying the function's behavior aligns with the problem statement.
