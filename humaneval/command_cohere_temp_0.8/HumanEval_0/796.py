```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of float values `numbers` and a threshold value `threshold` and checks if any two elements in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. It uses a generator expression, fueled by the zip function, to iterate over all pairs of adjacent elements in the list and checks if their absolute difference is smaller than the threshold. The any function then checks if any of these comparisons are true, and returns True if so – meaning that there are two elements close together in the list – or False if not. 

To see it in action, you can call the function with any list of numbers, such as `[[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5]]` and a threshold value, such as 0.5: 
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
```

Or another list and a different threshold:
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```

This will return `True` for the first example since `2.0` and `3.0` are closer together than `0.5` distance, and `False` for the second example as there are no two elements closer together than `0.3` distance.
