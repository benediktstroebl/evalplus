```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold value as inputs and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

To efficiently check if any two elements in a list are close, we can utilize the `any` function in combination with a generating expression using `zip`. The `zip` function pairs each element with every element following it. Subsequently, the subtraction `x - y` yields the distance between the two elements. When the outcome of this subtraction is less than the threshold, it signifies that the elements are close, prompting the function to return `True`. Conversely, if no pair surpasses the threshold, the function returns `False`. 

This approach allows for a concise and effective solution to the problem, encapsulating the core logic within a single line of code.

Here is a simple test case to validate the functionality of the function:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) == True

test_has_close_elements()
```

The test case illustrates the function's behavior for two distinct scenarios: when the list contains elements within the threshold and when it does not. 

This demonstration assures us that the function adeptly assesses whether any two elements in the list are within the specified threshold.
