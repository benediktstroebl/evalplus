```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function checks the closeness of all pairs of numbers in the list except for the first one (as it pairs with the second one, third one with the second one, and so on) using the `any` aggregate function and a generating expression that compares the absolute differences of pairs of numbers with the threshold. 

To test this algorithm, you can call the function with different lists of numbers and thresholds, and verify that the output matches the expected result. Here is an example: 
```python
# Test 1
assert not has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)

# Test 2
assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
```

This test suite verifies the correct behavior of the `has_close_elements` function for the given input tests. 
The first test asserts that no numbers in `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]` (which are 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0) are closer to each other than the threshold of 0.5. The second test asserts that numbers 2.0 and 2.8 in `[1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]` are closer to each other than the threshold of 0.3, therefore passing the test. 

This way, the function's behavior is correctly validated.
