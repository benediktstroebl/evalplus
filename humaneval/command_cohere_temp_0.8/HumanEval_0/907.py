Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
The `has_close_elements` function takes two parameters: a list of numbers `numbers` and a threshold `threshold`. It uses the `any` function to check if any element in the list is closer to its subsequent element (without considering the first element) than the `threshold`. The `zip` function is used to iterate over pairs of adjacent elements in the list, and the `abs` function is used to calculate the absolute difference between the pairs. The `any` function returns `True` if any of these differences is less than the `threshold`, indicating that there are close elements in the list.

Here's how you can use it in the context of the original markdown code block:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))

# Test Cases
assert not has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
``` 
This shows how the function correctly detects whether there are elements in the list that are closer to each other than the specified threshold.
