```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes two arguments; a list of numbers and a threshold. It uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if any element in the list differs from its neighboring element by less than the threshold. The use of `any` simplifies the logic by negating the condition. Using `zip` simplifies the comparison with the neighboring element, and the `x - y` expression calculates the difference between two numbers.

To test this function, you can use the following inputs:
```python
test_cases = [
    ([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [0.5], False],
     [[1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], [0.3], True],
])
```

The first test case includes a list of numbers, the threshold, and the expected result, which are assigned to a tuple. The `has_close_elements` function is then called with these values, and the result is compared with the expected output using the `assert` statement. Similarly, the second test case checks the success of the function with another list and threshold, ensuring that the function works correctly with different inputs.
