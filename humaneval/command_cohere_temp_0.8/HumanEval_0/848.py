```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of floats `numbers` and a threshold `threshold` as input. It uses the `any()` function with a generator expression to check if any element in the list differs from its neighboring element by less than the threshold. The generator expression, `x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`, iterates through pairs of elements in the list, calculates the difference between them, and checks if this difference is less than the threshold. The `zip()` function is used to iterate through pairs of adjacent elements in the list. 

The function returns `True` if any of these differences are less than the threshold, indicating that there are close elements in the list, and `False` otherwise. 

To confirm whether the function correctly checks for close elements in a list, you can call the function with a list of numbers and a threshold, and compare the output with the expected true or false value.
