```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs. It uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if there are two numbers in the list that are less than the threshold apart in value. The generator expression, `abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` iterates through the list of numbers, checking each number against the subsequent numbers in the list, calculating the absolute difference between the numbers, and comparing this to the threshold. 

This solution is concise and clear in its use of the `any` function with a generator to iteratively check for close elements in the list. It avoids the need for a nested loop structure and is efficient in its computational approach. 

This function can solve the use case presented in the problem and is tested for correct behavior against the test cases provided. It is important to note that the function assumes that the list elements are sorted. If the list is not sorted, the function may not return the correct value. Additional tests could be added to ensure that the function behaves correctly for unsorted lists as well.
