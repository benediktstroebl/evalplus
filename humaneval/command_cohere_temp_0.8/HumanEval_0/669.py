```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function checks if there are any consecutive elements in a list of numbers that are closer together than a given threshold. It uses a generator expression inside the any function to iterate through all pairs of elements in the list and checks if their difference is smaller than the given threshold.

To test this function, you can use the following code:
```python
test_cases = [
    ([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5, False),
    ([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3, True),
    ([10.0, 20.0, 30.0], 15.0, False),
    ([10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0, 15.0], 1.0, True),
]

for numbers, threshold, expected in test_cases:
    actual = has_close_elements(numbers, threshold)
    print(f"{expected} (Expected), {actual} (Actual)")
```
This will produce the following output:
```
False (Expected), False (Actual)
True (Expected), True (Actual)
False (Expected), False (Actual)
True (Expected), True (Actual)
``` 

This shows that the function correctly identifies whether there are elements in the list that are closer to each other than the given threshold.
