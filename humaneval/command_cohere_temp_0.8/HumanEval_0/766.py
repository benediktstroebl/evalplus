```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function examines each pair of numbers in the list using the `zip` function, calculating the absolute difference between each pair of numbers. Using the `any` function, the function determines if any of these absolute differences are less than the threshold. If any pairs of numbers are closer, the function returns `True`, if none are, it returns `False`. 

This solution is encapsulated in a single function, making it easily reusable and self-contained. It can efficiently solve the problem and is straightforward to understand and maintain.
