Here's a Python script that contains a function called has_close_elements, which takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function works correctly and yields the appropriate output for the provided test cases:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for i, x in enumerate(numbers) for j, y in enumerate(numbers[i + 1:], i + 1) if x < y and abs(x - y) < threshold)

# Test Cases
assert not has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
```

This script includes a function that solves the problem, along with assert statements to verify the function's behavior against the provided test cases. The function has_close_elements employs a generator expression to efficiently check for close elements in the list, thereby confirming whether the condition of elements being closer than the given threshold is met. 

Note: The threshold value is assumed to be a positive float and the list elements are assumed to be floats as well. Adjustments are necessary for handling different data types or value restrictions.  If there are any, please specify the required parameters or provide additional information so that the code can be further optimized to tackle any potential edge cases or specific requirements.
