```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function implements a simple algorithm that checks all pairs of numbers in the list except for duplicates, by zipping them, and then checks if the difference between any pair is less than the threshold. 

To ensure that the function's behavior corresponds to the problem, we can write a test using the `unittest` module:
```python
import unittest

class TestHasCloseElements(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_no_close_elements(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))

    def test_with_close_elements(self):
        self.assertTrue(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In the test suite are two individual test functions, `test_no_close_elements` and `test_with_close_elements`, each of which exercises the `has_close_elements` function with specific cases that represent edge scenarios. 

The `unittest.main()` call allows us to run the tests when the script is executed directly. 

To launch the test run directly from the command line, you can use the following command: 
```bash
python test_has_close_elements.py
```

Output will resemble the following: 
```
