```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` uses the `any` function to check if there are any elements in the list that are less than the threshold. The generator expression `x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` creates a generator that compares each pair of numbers in the list `numbers` with a pairing offset by one (i.e., `numbers[1:]`) using the `zip` function, and checks whether the difference between the current elements is less than the given threshold.

This solution has a complexity of O(n^2) as it compares each element of the list with every other element in the list.
