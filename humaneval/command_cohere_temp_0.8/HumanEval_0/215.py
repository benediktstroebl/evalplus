```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function examines each pair of numbers in the list using the `zip` function, calculating the absolute difference between each pair of numbers. Using the `any` function, the function determines if any of these absolute differences are less than the threshold. If any are, then it returns `True`, meaning that the list contains closely spaced numbers. 

To ensure that the function behaves correctly, it is recommended to include tests in the code, such as:
```python
assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) == False

assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) == True
```

These tests assert the function's behavior for the provided examples in the original problem description.
