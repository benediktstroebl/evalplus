```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) <= threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

To prove its function, it is tasked to undergo the following test cases:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    assert not has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
```

This tests the function against the example use cases provided in the problem statement.
