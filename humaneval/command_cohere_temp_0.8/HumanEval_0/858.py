```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for i, x in enumerate(numbers) for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)) for y in numbers[j])
```
The function `has_close_elements` takes two arguments; a list of numbers and a threshold. It uses a generator expression to iterate through all pairs of numbers in the list, and checks if the difference between any two numbers is less than the threshold. The `any` function then checks if any of these pairs satisfy this condition, and returns True if so, and False otherwise.  This approach has a time complexity of `O(n^2)` due to the pairwise iteration but could be improved to `O(n log n)` with computational optimization techniques like sorting the list or using hashes. 
The tests cases correspond to the ones provided in the prompt and are included to verify the correctness of the function. 

```python
# Testing the function
def test_has_close_elements():
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) == True

test_has_close_elements()
``` 
This test can be run directly in the Python environment by importing the `unittest` module and running the `test_has_close_elements` function as shown above.
