```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This Python script defines a function called `has_close_elements`, which takes two arguments: a list of floating numbers called `numbers` and a threshold value also defined as `threshold`. 

The function returns `True` if there are two elements in the list that are less than the threshold apart, and `False` otherwise. This is achieved using a `zip` and a `filter` approach. `zip` pairs each element with the following element, and `filter` checks if the difference is less than the threshold. 

The function returns `True` because the list `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]` has two elements (`1.0` and `2.0`) that are less than 0.5 units apart. The function returns `False` for the second example because none of the differences are less than 0.3.  This solution is efficient and easy to read, and should handle all edge cases.
