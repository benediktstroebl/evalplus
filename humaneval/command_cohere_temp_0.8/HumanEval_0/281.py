```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes two arguments; a list of numbers and a threshold value. It uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if any of the differences between consecutive elements in the list are less than the threshold. The use of `any` simplifies the logic by negating the condition with the `not` keyword to return a boolean result.

To test this function, you can use the following code:
```python
test_lists = [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], [10.0, 11.0, 12.0]]
test_thresholds = [0.5, 0.3, 1.3]

expected_results = [False, True, False]

for test_list, expected in zip(test_lists, expected_results):
    assert has_close_elements(test_list, *expected)
```

This code provides a list of test lists and an equivalent list of expected results for comparison with the `has_close_elements` function. You can optionally add more test cases to simulate different scenarios.
