```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) <= threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs. It uses the `any()` function with a generator expression to check if any element is within the threshold of any other element in the list. The generator expression, `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`, pairs each element with every other element in the list, and the `abs()` function calculates the absolute difference between the pair of elements, which is then compared to the threshold with the `<=` operator. 

To see this function in action, you can call it with the following input:
```python
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))
```
The output should be:
```bash
False
```

This demonstrates the function working as intended, as the numbers `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]` don't have any elements that are less than or equal to 0.5 from each other, hence the function returns `False`. 

If you run the new test:
```python
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))
```
you will get as output:
```bash
True
```
This confirms that the function is also capable of detecting elements that are closer than the threshold. 

This function is straightforward and assumes no worst-case scenarios, which could improve its performance and robustness; nevertheless, the core functionality fulfills the requirement.
