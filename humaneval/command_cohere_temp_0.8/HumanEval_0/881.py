```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function relies on using a generator expression alongside the `any` and `zip` functions to determine if any elements in the list exceed the given threshold. 

This solution is efficient and succinct, providing a clear indication of the proximity of elements in the list.
