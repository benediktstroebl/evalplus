```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for i, x in enumerate(numbers) for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)) for y in numbers[j])
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two elements of the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function employs a list comprehension that checks all possible pairs of elements in the list, and returns `True` if any of the pairs are closer to each other than the threshold. The code is self-contained and can be run as standalone Python script.
