```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` checks if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer to each other than the provided threshold. It uses a list comprehension, which is a powerful feature that allows you to make complex checks and transformations on your data in an easy and expressible way. 

The comprehension checks each number in the list with the subsequent ones, subtracting them and comparing to the threshold. If the condition is true for any of the comparisons, the function returns True, otherwise, it returns False. 

This approach provides a simple and scalable solution to the problem, making it efficient and easy to understand. 

You can test this function using the following code:
```python
import unittest

class TestHasCloseElements(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_no_close_elements(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))

    def test_with_close_elements(self):
        self.assertTrue(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This code imports the `unittest` module, which is a module that provides a framework for writing and running tests in Python. It defines a test class `TestHasCloseElements` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. This allows you to write test methods that start with the word `test`, and the framework will automatically discover and run these tests. In this case, it will run `test_no_close_elements` and `test_with_close_elements`. 

The `test_no_close_elements` function checks if the function `has_close_elements` returns False when there are no two close elements in the list and passes this threshold to the function through a keyword argument called `threshold`. 

The `test_with_close_elements` function checks if the function `has_close_elements` returns True when there are close elements in the list and passes a different threshold to the function. 

Finally, the `unittest.main()` function is called to run the tests. 

Note that you can also visualize the execution of the tests in a log, which is particularly useful for extensive tests. To do this, you can use the following code: 
```python
import logging
import unittest

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

class TestHasCloseElements(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_no_close_elements(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))

    def test_with_close_elements(self):
        self.assertTrue(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this code, the `logging` module is imported, which provides a flexible framework for issuing log messages in Python. It is then configured to show logs of level `INFO` and above through the `basicConfig` definition.
