```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` checks if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer than the specified threshold by using a generator expression (`any`) and a `zip` function to compare each number in the list with every other number in the list to check for the threshold criterion. 

The function's accuracy is evident in these test cases:
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False

>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
``` 

These test cases validate the function's operation. One case confirms that no two elements in a list are closer than a threshold value, while the other case confirms that at least two elements in the list are closer than the given threshold.
