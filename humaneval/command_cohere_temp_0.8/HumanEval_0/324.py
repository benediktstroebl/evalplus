```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of floats `numbers` and a threshold `threshold`. It uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if there are two elements in the list that are less than the threshold apart. 

Here's an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```

This will return `False` in the first case and `True` in the second case, respectively, as the elements are not close enough in the first case or are close enough in the second case. 

This approach uses a concise one-liner to solve the problem, which is efficiently coded and easier to maintain. Let say we have multiple entries in the list, we have to check every possible pair, in this case, the generator expression for the `zip` function helps us here to iterate over all the possible pairs smoothly. And the `abs` function helps to get the distance of the two numbers in the list.  With this approach, we can handle the problem statement in a more efficient way.  In Python, using a generator expression with `zip` is a preferred and elegant way to handle pairs of items in a list.
