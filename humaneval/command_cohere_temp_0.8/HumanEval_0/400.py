```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) <= threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function checks if there are any two numbers in the list `numbers` that are consecutive (index difference of 1) and their absolute difference is less than or equal to the `threshold`. 

This is how the function works:
1. `any` is a scalar function that takes as input a list and a boolean function, and returns the boolean value that answers the question: "Is there at least one element in the list for which the provided boolean function returns True?".
2. In this case, the list is `numbers` and the boolean function is `abs(x - y) <= threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`. 
3. `zip` combines the two iterables into a tuple and returns a tuple of size `n`. It cycles through the iterables to match the corresponding elements. Therefore, `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` pairs each element of `numbers` with the consecutive element at index `1`. 
4. The expression `abs(x - y) <= threshold` checks if the absolute difference between the two consecutive elements `(x, y)` is less than or equal to the threshold. 
5. If any such pairs exist in the list, the `any` function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 
```note
The threshold parameter is used to determine the minimum difference between two numbers for them to be considered close. It is the tolerance level for the comparison.```

This approach uses a **binary search** technique, which is efficient for lists with consecutive elements. 

The `zip` function pairs up consecutive elements for comparison, and the `any` function checks if any of these pairs have an absolute difference less than or equal to the threshold. 

The provided example tests demonstrate the usage of the function. 

The first test case `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]` with a threshold of 0.5 returns `False` since there are no consecutive elements that are close to each other. 

The second test case `[1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]` with a threshold of 0.3 returns `True` because 2.0 and 2.8 are consecutive elements in the list and their absolute difference is less than the threshold. 

These examples demonstrate how the function correctly identifies whether there are close elements in the list within the specified threshold. Plese do note that, unlike the example tests, the real-world dataset may not be uniformly spaced out and might have elements scattered across a wider range. In such cases, you may find yourself tweaking the threshold parameter to find the right balance between false positives and false negatives.
