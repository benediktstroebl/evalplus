```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function relies on using a generator expression alongside the `any()` function to determine if there are any close elements within the list.

To test this function, you can call it with different input test cases to verify its correctness. Here is an example:
```python
# Test case 1
test_list = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
test_threshold = 0.5
expected_result = False

result = has_close_elements(test_list, test_threshold)

assert result == expected_result

# Test case 2
test_list = [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
test_threshold = 0.3
expected_result = True

result = has_close_elements(test_list, test_threshold)

assert result == expected_result
```

This provides a straightforward way to confidently assert the correctness of the function against different test cases.
