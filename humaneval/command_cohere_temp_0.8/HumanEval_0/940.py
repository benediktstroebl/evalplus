```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function `has_close_elements()` works by checking if there's any pair of elements in the list where the difference between them is less than the given threshold. It does this using a generator expression, which allows us to do element-wise comparisons efficiently. 

You can test this function using the following command:
```python
>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```

The first example returns `False` since there's no pair of numbers with a difference less than 0.5, and the second example returns `True` correctly. 

I hope this helps, let me know if you would like me to explain anything in detail!
