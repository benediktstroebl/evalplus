```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` checks if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer to each other than the provided threshold. It uses a list comprehension, which is a powerful tool in Python for creating a new list based on the values of an existing list. It then checks if any of the absolute differences between adjacent elements in the list are less than the given threshold. If the condition is met, the function returns `True`, indicating that there are closely numbered elements in the list. Conversely, if none of the differences are within the threshold, it returns `False`.

To use this function, you can import it from the file it is defined in, or define it in the same file where you plan to use it. Here is an example of how to use it directly from this file:
```python
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
threshold = 0.5
result = has_close_elements(numbers, threshold)
print(result)  # Output: False
```

This would output `False` in this case because the numbers in the list are far apart from each other.

If you intend to use the function in a different script, you can import it there using the following command:
```python
from your_file_name import has_close_elements
``` 

This way, you can leverage this function in your development without repeatedly copying over the code.
