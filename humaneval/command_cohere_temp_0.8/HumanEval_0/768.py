```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` uses the `any` function to check if there are any elements in the list that are closer than the specified threshold. The `zip` function is used to iterate over pairs of elements in the list, and the `x - y < threshold` condition checks if the difference between two consecutive elements is less than the threshold.

To see the full power of the function, let's run some test cases to see how it works:
```python
# Test case one:
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False

# Test case two:
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True

# Test case three:
>>> has_close_elements([10.0, 10.001, 10.01, 20.0], 1.0)
True
``` 

In the above test cases, the function returns `False` in the first case since there is no element that is closer than `0.5` in the list `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]`. In the second case, the list contains `[1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]` and the function returns `True` as the difference between the last and second-to-last elements is smaller than `0.3`. In the third case, the function returns `True` as all elements differ by 1% or less from each other, which is less than the threshold of 1.0.

This function is straightforward to use and understand when checking if there are close elements in a list compared to a given threshold.
