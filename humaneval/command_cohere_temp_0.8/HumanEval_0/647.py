```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) <= threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as parameters, it uses the `any` function with a lambda function to check for each pair of numbers in the list, except for the first one (as it compares with the second one and onwards), whether their absolute difference is less than or equal to the threshold, if all comparisons return True, the function returns True, otherwise, it returns False. 

To test this function, you can use the following Markdown code block with example tests:
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```

These tests check the functionality of the `has_close_elements` function with two different sets of input values. The first test asserts that the function returns False when no elements in the list are closer than the threshold of 0.5. The second test asserts that the function returns True when the elements in the list 2.0 and 5.0 are closer than the threshold of 0.3. 

The function should correctly determine whether the elements in the list are close to each other according to the given threshold. 

These tests cover basic scenarios involving one and more close elements in the list, but you can expand this block with more tests covering other scenarios.  If you encounter any difficulties in executing the tests, let me know and I'll help.
