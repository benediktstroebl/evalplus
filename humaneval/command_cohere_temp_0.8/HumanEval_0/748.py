```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

To efficiently check if there are any adjacent elements in a list that are closer than a certain threshold, `any` with a generator expression and the `zip` function are used. The generator expression iterates pairs of elements and calculates the absolute difference between the pairs, the `any` then checks if any of these differences are less than the given threshold.

Here is a test to verify the solution:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    # False case
    assert not has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    # True case
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)

test_has_close_elements()
```

The first test case demonstrates an example where the result is `False`, meaning that no two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold. In the second case, however, the result is `True` because the number `2.8` is close to the number `2.0`, and the threshold is `0.3`. 

To conclude, the code provides a clear and concise solution to the problem, with the function successfully identifying whether any two numbers in a list are closer than a specified threshold. 

*Note*: you can add more cases in the test to assert the function's correctness.  Also, you can use tools like `pytest` which are designed to facilitate testing procedures and improve the quality and maintainability of your code.
