Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
The `has_close_elements` function takes two arguments; a list of numbers and a threshold value. It uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if any adjacent elements in the list have a difference less than the threshold. The generator expression, `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`, pairs each element with the following element in the list (skipping the last element). The `abs(x - y) < threshold` condition checks if the absolute difference between the pairs is less than the threshold.

To test this function, you can use the following code:
```python
test_cases = [
    ([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5, False),
    ([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3, True),
]

for numbers, threshold, expected in test_cases:
    actual = has_close_elements(numbers, threshold)
    assert actual == expected
```
This provides an example of how the function can be used and checks if it returns the expected result for each test case. 
The `has_close_elements` function is designed to efficiently check if there are any adjacent elements in a list of numbers that are close to each other within a given threshold.
