```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` accepts a list of numbers and a threshold as parameters. It uses the `any` function to check if there are any elements in the list that are less than the threshold apart in value from their subsequent elements. The `zip` function is used to iterate over pairs of adjacent elements in the list, and the difference between the elements in each pair is checked against the threshold.

To see the usage of the function, you can call it with specific inputs:
```python
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # Output: False
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # Output: True
```

This approach provides a straightforward way to check if there are elements in the list that are close (less than the threshold) to each other. 

The function's behavior can be summarized in the following way:
- If the list contains elements that are close to each other (less than the threshold), the function returns True.
- If all the elements in the list are far from each other (more than the threshold), the function returns False. 

Such a problem can be solved in many other ways in Python. If interested in other approaches, let me know and I will provide alternative solutions.
