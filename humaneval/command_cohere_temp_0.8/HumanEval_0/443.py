```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function checks if there exist any two numbers in a list of numbers that are closer to each other than a given threshold. The function returns True if such pairs are found, and False otherwise. To solve this problem, it uses a generator expression, and the any function checks if any of the pairs are closer than the threshold. 

To test this function, you can use the following:
```python
test_cases = [
    ([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5, False),
    ([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3, True),
]
for numbers, threshold, expected in test_cases:
    assert has_close_elements(numbers, threshold) == expected
```
This tests the function has_close_elements with a list of test cases, providing the input list of numbers, the threshold, and the expected output, comparing it to the output of the function. 
For better code organization, you can also include the function in a Python module with corresponding tests. 
Please note that to run this code, you should have Python and a Python testing framework installed.
