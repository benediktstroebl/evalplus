```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as parameters. It uses the `any` function to check if any element in the list differs from its neighboring element by less than the threshold. The `zip` function is used to iterate over pairs of neighboring elements in the list. The `abs` function is used to calculate the absolute difference between neighboring elements. If the difference is less than the threshold, the function returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`.  This solution has a complexity of O(n) where `n` is the length of the input list.  This approach doesn't require any additional imports and is compatible with Python 3.x.

To better understand the behavior of this function, let's examine some examples:
```python
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))
```
The output will be:
```
False
True
```
This shows that the function correctly identifies whether there are elements in the list that are closer than the given threshold. 

This solution can be efficiently optimized by using the `heapq` module, which takes advantage of the `heap` data structure and allows for constant time queries for the minimum and maximum values in a list of numbers. The `heapq` module is part of the Python standard library, making it readily available without any additional installations. 

However, it's important to note that using the `heapq` module introduces additional complexity and may not be suitable for large lists where brute-force solutions outperform more complex approaches. 
Here's a version of the function that incorporates the `heapq` module: 

```python
from typing import List
import heapq as hq

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    min_val, max_val = hq.nsmallest(2, numbers), hq.nlargest(2, numbers)
    return min_val[1] - max_val[0] < threshold
```
In this version, the `nsmallest` and `nlargest` functions from the `heapq` module are used to efficiently find the minimum and maximum values from the list of numbers. By selecting only the smallest and largest elements, the query time is reduced to constant time, regardless of the list's size. 

However, it's worth noting that employing the `heapq` module introduces additional complexity due to the need to import the module and understand its functionalities. Ultimately, the choice between using heapq or not depends on the specific requirements of the problem and the size of the input list. 
For small to medium-sized lists, the original solution without using `heapq` would be more straightforward and sufficient.
