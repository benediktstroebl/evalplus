```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes two arguments; a list of numbers and a threshold. It uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if any element in the list differs from its neighboring element by less than the threshold. The `zip` function is used to iterate over the list pairs, and the `x - y` expression calculates the difference between two successive list elements.

To see it in action, you can call the function with an example input and print its output.

```python
input_list = [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
threshold = 0.3
print(has_close_elements(input_list, threshold))
```

The output will be:
```
True
```

This example indicates that the function `has_close_elements` is working as expected. 

This function can be helpful in various applications, including data cleaning, where it might be used to identify erroneous or duplicated entries in a dataset. 

You can add additional tests to the script to further validate the function's behavior.
