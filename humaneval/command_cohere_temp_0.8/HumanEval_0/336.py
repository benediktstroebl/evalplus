```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function checks if the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list is smaller than the threshold. 

To test this function, we can create a unit test that provides a list of numbers and a threshold, and checks if the function returns the correct boolean value. Below is a test that checks if the function returns False for a list of numbers where no two elements are closer than the threshold:
```python
def test_has_close_elements_false():
    assert not has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
```

And here is a test that checks if the function returns True for a list of numbers where some elements are closer than the threshold:
```python
def test_has_close_elements_true():
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
```

This testing methodology ensures that the function `has_close_elements()` works correctly for different inputs.
