Here's a Python script that contains a function called has_close_elements, which takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function works correctly and yields the appropriate output for the provided test cases:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for i, x in enumerate(numbers) for j, y in enumerate(numbers[i + 1:], i + 1) if x < y and abs(x - y) < threshold)
```

The function uses a generator expression to iterate through all pairs of elements in the list, and checks if the difference between any two numbers is smaller than the given threshold.

To test this function, you can run the following code, which would yield the desired output ('True' for the second test case and 'False' for the first test case):
```python
import unittest

class TestHasCloseElements(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_has_close_elements(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))
        self.assertTrue(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
This way, the test case included verifies if the function works correctly for different inputs.
