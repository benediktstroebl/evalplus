```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function employs a zipper operation, provided by the `zip` function, to iterate over all adjacent pairs of numbers in the list. The `any` function then checks if the difference between any of these pairs is less than the specified threshold. 

To ensure the function behaves as intended, it is recommended to write corresponding tests, like the ones provided in the problem statement.
