```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) <= threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function `has_close_elements()` works by checking if there's any pair of elements in the list where the difference between them is less than the given threshold. It does this using a generator expression, which allows us to do element-wise comparisons efficiently. 

You can test this function using the following Markdown code block:
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```

This tests the function has_close_elements with two examples, first passing an array with distances greater than the threshold and secondly passing an array with a distance smaller than the threshold.
