```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This Python script defines a function called `has_close_elements`, which takes two arguments: a list of floating numbers called `numbers` and a threshold value also defined as `threshold`. 

The function returns `True` if there are any pairs of elements in the list whose absolute difference is less than the threshold, and `False` otherwise. 

It uses a `zip` function to iterate through the list of numbers, calculating the absolute difference between each pair of adjacent elements in the list, and then checks if any of these differences are less than the given threshold. The `any` function is used to determine if any of these differences are below the threshold value.

This solution is efficient as it uses Python's built-in typing and functional programming features and does not require any additional libraries. 
The function stands alone and does not rely on external variables or functions. 

Also, the function's behavior is well-documented and easy to understand, making it ideal for solving this problem.

The problem essentially asks if there are any "close" elements in a list of numbers, with a given threshold defining what "close" means. The Python script uses a `zip` and `any` pipeline to detect if any elements in the list are within the threshold of each other, returning a boolean answer to this question. 

Note that the script assumes that the list contains at least two elements to allow for pairs of elements to be compared. If the list contains only one element or is empty, the function will return `False`. In the context of a unit test, you would want to validate the behavior of this function for various inputs, such as the example use cases provided in the original problem. You can write tests that assert the expected outcomes for different configurations of inputs, ensuring that the function's behavior aligns with its documentation.
