```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function uses a generator expression, formulated as a list comprehension but without the need for an intermediate list, to iterate over all pairs of elements in the list of numbers and calculates the absolute difference between each pair. The `any` function then checks if any of these differences are less than the given threshold and returns `True` accordingly.

To ensure the functionality of the defined function, it is recommended to run appropriate tests. These tests could involve passing different lists of numbers and thresholds to verify that the function's behavior aligns with the problem statement. Here is an example:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    # True case
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([10.0, 20.0, 30.0], 1.0) == True
    assert has_close_elements([10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0], 5.0) == True

    # False case
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) == False
    assert has_close_elements([10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0], 1.0) == False

test_has_close_elements()
```

This test suite covers a variety of cases:
- `has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)` returns `True` because the absolute difference between `2.0` and `2.8` is less than 0.3. 

- `has_close_elements([10.0, 20.0, 30.0], 1.0)` returns `True` because the absolute difference between `20.0` and `30.0` is less than 1.0. 

- `has_close_elements([10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0], 5.0)` returns `True` because the absolute difference between `30.0` and `40.0` is less than 5.0. 

- `has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)` returns `False` because no two numbers are closer than 0.5. 

- `has_close_elements([10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0], 1.0)` returns `False` because no two numbers are closer than 1.0. 

In this test suite, `assert` statements are used to confirm expected outcomes. If the assumption fails, the test will produce an `AssertionError`.  Thus, giving feedback to the user about incorrect function behavior and confirming the correctness of the `has_close_elements` function.
