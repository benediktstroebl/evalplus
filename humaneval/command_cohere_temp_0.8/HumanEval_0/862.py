```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function checks if there exist any two numbers in a list of numbers that are closer to each other than a given threshold. The function returns a boolean value that indicates whether such a pair of numbers is found. The function utilizes a list comprehension that loops through all pairs formed by removing each element in numbers[1:] (all elements except the first) and the first element, x, whereby the difference x - y is computed. The logic expedites testing if the difference is less than the threshold for any pair of numbers.

Here is a simple test to verify the functionality of the function:
```python
import unittest

class TestHasCloseElements(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_has_close_elements_true(self):
        self.assertTrue(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))
    def test_has_close_elements_false(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
``` 
The test class TestHasCloseElements contains two test methods to validate the function has_close_elements:
1. test_has_close_elements_true: This method tests the true scenario whereby a list containing [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0] with a threshold of 0.3 is expected to return True since the distance between 2.0 and 2.8 is less than 0.3.
2. test_has_close_elements_false: This method tests the false scenario whereby a list containing [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] with a threshold of 0.5 is expected to return False since no two numbers in the list are closer than 0.5. 

The assert statements utilize Python's built-in unittest library to validate the function has_close_elements. If the test class TestHasCloseElements is run directly with unittest.main(), this will result in the execution of these tests, and in the event that the tests pass, an indication that the function operates as expected will be provided.
