Here's a Python script that contains a function called has_close_elements, which takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function works correctly and passes the provided tests. The code is formatted as a markdown code block:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    """
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a in numbers for b in numbers if a != b)

# Tests
assert not has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
```

The function uses a generator expression with nested loops to compare each number in the list to every other number in the list, excluding self-comparisons. The any function then checks if there are any comparisons that yield a difference smaller than the given threshold. The function returns True if any such comparisons are found, and False otherwise.  This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops, which is acceptable given the relatively small sizes of the input lists typically used for this kind of task.

The two test cases assert the correct behavior of the function with the provided examples from the docstring. Feel free to add more tests to cover other scenarios and edge cases if needed.  This code retains the original problem statement, and the only change is the addition of the tests which help ensure the function operates as expected. 

This code can be imported and used as a module, but self-contained functions like this are typically included in a larger script or codebase, so it's common to copy-paste these kinds of utility functions directly into the appropriate context, rather than importing them from a separate file.  This is especially common in simple projects or during the prototyping stage when importing many external modules may be overhead. The self-contained aspect makes it versatile and easily transferable between different parts of a program or even separate projects, preserving clarity and reusability.  If you intend to use this function in a larger project, you may want to consider organizing it into a separate file or module, along with other relevant utility functions, to improve maintainability.
