```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function achieves this by using a generator expression, also known as a concise comprehension, to check pairs of adjacent elements in the list using the `zip` function. The `any` function then checks whether any of these pairs have a difference smaller than the given threshold.  The `abs` function takes care of the difference being calculated irrespective of the order of the numbers in the list.
