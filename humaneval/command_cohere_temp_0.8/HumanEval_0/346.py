Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
The `has_close_elements` function takes two parameters: a list of numbers `numbers` and a threshold `threshold`. It uses the `any` function to check if any element in the list is closer to its subsequent element (after indexing by `1`) by a threshold. The `zip` function is used to iterate over the pairs of elements and the `abs` function computes the absolute difference between them. 

Here is how to use this function:
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```
These examples correspond to the test cases provided in the initial description.
