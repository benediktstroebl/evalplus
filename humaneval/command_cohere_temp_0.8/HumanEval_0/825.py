```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) <= threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function checks if there are any two elements in the list for which their difference is less than or equal to the threshold using the `any` and `zip` functions and `threshold` parameter.

To test this script, you can create a separate test file or add test cases to the script itself. Here is an example of adding test cases to the script:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    # Test case 1
    numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
    threshold = 0.5
    expected = False
    assert has_close_elements(numbers, threshold) == expected

    # Test case 2
    numbers = [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
    threshold = 0.3
    expected = True
    assert has_close_elements(numbers, threshold) == expected

test_has_close_elements()
```

This would verify the functionality of the `has_close_elements` function with the provided test cases.  If you have more questions or require assistance with any related topic, don't hesitate to ask.
