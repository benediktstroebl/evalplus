```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

This function takes a list of floats `numbers` and a float `threshold` as input and returns a boolean that indicates whether any two elements in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function employs a generator expression utilizing the Python zipper to iterate pairs of elements in the list `numbers`, and checks if their absolute difference is smaller than the threshold with the `any` aggregate function.

To ensure this function behaves correctly under various edge cases, it is recommended to include tests that cover scenarios like empty lists, single-element lists, and lists with elements exceeding the provided threshold. These tests would look like:
```python
def test_has_close_elements_with_empty_list():
    assert not has_close_elements([], 0.5)

def test_has_close_elements_with_single_element():
    assert not has_close_elements([1.0], 0.5)

def test_has_close_elements_with_elements_exceeding_threshold():
    assert not has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 2.0)
```
