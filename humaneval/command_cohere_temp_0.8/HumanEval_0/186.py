```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as parameters. It uses the zip function to iterate over the list of numbers, and the list comprehension to check if any of the differences between subsequent pairs of numbers in the list are less than the threshold.

The function returns True if at least one pair of numbers closer to each other than the given threshold is found, and False otherwise.

To follow the problem statement, we can add test cases as markdown code blocks to verify the function behavior:
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```
As expected, the first example return False, since there are no adjacent elements that close in the list. Meanwhile, the second example returns True, due to the presence of elements 2.8 and 2.0 that differ less than 0.3.
