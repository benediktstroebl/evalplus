```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function relies on the use of a generator expression `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` to iterate over pairs of elements in the list. The `any` function is then used to check whether any of the pairs have a difference smaller than the given threshold.

To test this script, you can create a separate test file, or use `assert` statements as below:
```python
assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5), "False"
assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3), "True"
```

This would verify the correctness of the new function.
