Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
The function `has_close_elements` takes two parameters: 
1. `numbers`: A list of float numbers.
2. `threshold`: A float value used to compare with the difference between numbers in the list. 

The function returns `True` if there are any pairs of numbers in the list whose difference is less than the threshold. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```
This demonstrates the usage of the function with examples of input lists and thresholds. In the first example, the function returns `False` since there are no numbers with a difference less than 0.5. In the second example, the function returns `True` since the difference between 2.0 and 2.8 is less than 0.3.
