```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) <= threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function `has_close_elements` checks if there are any two numbers in the list `numbers` that are closer to each other than the given `threshold`. 

It does this by using a `zip` operation to pair each element in the list with the subsequent element, and then uses an `any` operation to check if there are any pairs for which the difference is less than or equal to the `threshold`. 

Thus, the function solves the problem of checking for close elements in a list of numbers, defining its own custom logic that may be different from the example function provided in the original prompt.
