Here's a Python script that contains a function called has_close_elements, which solves the problem you described:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as parameters. It uses a generator expression (zip) to iterate over pairs of elements in the list. The absolute difference between each pair of numbers is computed, and this is compared with the given threshold. If any of these differences is less than the threshold, the function returns True, indicating that there are closely spaced elements in the list. Otherwise, it returns False. 

To test this function, you can use the following tests:
```python
import unittest

class TestHasCloseElements(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_no_close_elements(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))

    def test_with_close_elements(self):
        self.assertTrue(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))

    def test_with_single_number(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([7.0], 0.5))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```
This script uses the unittest framework to create a test class with three individual test methods that verify the function has_close_elements with a variety of inputs and expected outcomes. When the script is run, these tests will be executed, ensuring the correctness of the function.  The script also uses the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to only run the tests if the script is directly executed, and not if it's imported as a module.
