```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function examines each number in the list in relation to the others. It uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if any elements satisfy the condition. 

To test this algorithm, you can call the function with various inputs and compare it with the expected output:
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```

This should return `False` for the first example and `True` for the second, as the first set of numbers does not have elements closer than 0.5, while the second set does have elements closer than 0.3.
