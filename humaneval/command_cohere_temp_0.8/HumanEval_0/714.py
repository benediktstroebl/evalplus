```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of floats and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two elements in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function implements this by using a generator expression, which is a compact way of implementing a loop in Python. 

The generator expression `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` pairs each element in the list with every element after it. The expression `x - y` calculates the difference between the pairs, and the condition `x - y < threshold` checks if the difference is smaller than the threshold. 

Using `any()` function allows to conveniently check if any of these differences are smaller than the threshold, and thus determine if there are any close elements in the list. 

To make the code more readable, the docstring describes the purpose of the function and provides examples of usage.
