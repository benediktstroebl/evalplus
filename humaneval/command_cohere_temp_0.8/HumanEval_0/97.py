Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
The `has_close_elements` function takes two arguments; a list of numbers `numbers` and a threshold `threshold`. It uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check for any pairs of elements in the list that are closer together than the threshold. The generator expression, `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`, pairs each element with the following element. The expression `abs(x - y) < threshold` checks if the absolute difference between the pairs is less than the threshold. 

To test this function, you can use the following inputs:
```python
test_cases = [
    ([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5, False),
    ([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3, True),
]
for numbers, threshold, expected in test_cases:
    assert has_close_elements(numbers, threshold) == expected
```

The `assert` statement verifies that the output of the `has_close_elements` function with the input `numbers` and `threshold` is equal to the expected `boolean value`. 
The test cases demonstrate the function's behavior for different inputs, including edge cases, resulting in True or False respectively.
