```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs and checks if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function returns `True` if such pairs are found, and `False` otherwise. 

This solution leverages the any function to check if any element pair in the list has a difference less than the threshold. The chaining of comparisons is accomplished via the compressed syntax `x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`. 

To test this script, you can create a separate test file, or simply use an interactive test session, e.g.:
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```

This should return the expected output based on the above description. Feel free to modify the tests or add more to cover different scenarios.
