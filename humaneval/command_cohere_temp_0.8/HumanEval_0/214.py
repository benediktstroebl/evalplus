```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) <= threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, it uses the `any` function with a lambda function to check if any two numbers in the list have a difference that is less than or equal to the threshold. For the correctness of the solution, see the given test cases below:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    # Test case 1
    assert not has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    # Test case 2
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)

test_has_close_elements()
```
The first test case ensures that the function returns `False` since the numbers [1, 2, 3] have no elements that are closer to each other than the threshold of 0.5. The second test case checks that the function returns `True` since the numbers [1, 2.8, 3, 4, 5, 2] have two adjacent elements (2 and 2.8) that are closer than the threshold of 0.3.  The last line ensures that the function passes both test cases.
