```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function relies on the use of a generator expression, which allows for short-circuit logic and yields results only as necessary. This expression takes a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns whether there are any elements whose absolute difference is less than the threshold.

This solution passes the provided tests, as it correctly identifies that the first list does not contain any elements that are close to each other, whereas the second list does contain elements that are close to each other. 

It's worth noting that the algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the input list, as it iterates through the list only once. The function also has a time complexity of O(1), making it an efficient solution for the problem.
