```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) <= threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as parameters, it uses the `any` function to check if any element in the list is closer to another element than the threshold. The `zip` function is used to iterate over pairs of elements, and the `abs` function is used to calculate the absolute difference between two elements, if the difference is less than or equal to the threshold, the function returns true, otherwise, it returns false. 

To ensure the function's correctness, let's break down the problem and analyze the function's behavior using some examples:
```python
# Testing the function has_close_elements
# Test case one
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # Expected output: False

# Test case two
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # Expected output: True
```

The first test case provides a list of numbers [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] and a threshold of 0.5. In this case, the function will return false because there are no two numbers that are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The second test case provides a list of numbers [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0] and a threshold of 0.3. In this case, the element 2.0 is closer (by difference of 0.2) to 2.8 than the threshold 0.3, so the function will return true. 

Thus, for each test case, the function has_close_elements will return the expected output.
