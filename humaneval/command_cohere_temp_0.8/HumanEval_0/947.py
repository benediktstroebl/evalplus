Here's a Python script that contains a function called has_close_elements, which takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function works correctly and yields the appropriate output for the provided test cases.

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for i, x in enumerate(numbers) for j, y in enumerate(numbers[i + 1:], i + 1) if x < y and abs(x - y) < threshold)
```

This function employs a nested iterate statement to compare each pair of numbers in the list, disregarding the order of appearance. The absolute difference between each pair is computed, and the function returns True if any of these differences is less than the threshold. The function returns False if the condition is not met for any number pair in the list.

Here is an example of how to use the has_close_elements function for the provided test cases:
```python
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))
```

This will result in the following output:
```
False
True
```

This example demonstrates how the has_close_elements function can be used to solve the problem and obtain the desired results for the test cases.
