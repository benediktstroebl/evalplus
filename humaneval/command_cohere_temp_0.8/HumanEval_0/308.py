```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function checks if there are any consecutive elements in a list of numbers that are closer together than a given threshold. It does this by using a generator expression, which iterates through unique pairs of elements in the list, calculates the absolute difference between each pair, and checks if any of these differences are smaller than the given threshold.

To test this function, you can use the following code:
```python
import unittest

class TestHasCloseElements(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_no_elements(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))

    def test_far_elements(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))

    def test_close_elements(self):
        self.assertTrue(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.6))

    def test_with_just_two_elements(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0], 0.5))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This test suite contains four individual test functions (`test_no_elements`, `test_far_elements`, `test_close_elements`, and `test_with_just_two_elements`) that cover different scenarios. Each test function asserts the function behavior as expected through `self.assertFalse()` or `self.assertTrue()`. 

When executed, this test suite will comprehensively verify the functionality of the `has_close_elements` function based on the given problem statement and expected behavior outlined in the docstring. 
If the function behaves as expected, you should see an output like this: 
```

This indicates that all tests passed successfully.  If the function doesn't behave as expected, the failing test will output the respective line of code that caused the test to fail, along with the encountered error.
