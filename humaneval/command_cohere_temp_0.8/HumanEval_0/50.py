```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function `has_close_elements` checks if there are any two numbers in the list `numbers` that are closer to each other than the given `threshold`. It uses a list comprehension, and the `any` function to check if any element comparisons are less than the given threshold. 

To test this function, you can use the following code:
```python
import unittest

class TestHasCloseElements(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_has_close_elements_true(self):
        self.assertTrue(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))

    def test_has_close_elements_false(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))
    # Add more tests as needed for other scenarios
  
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
This code provides a test suite with two test cases that check the functionality of the `has_close_elements` function with different inputs. 
To run the test, you can copy this code into a Python file (e.g., `test_has_close_elements.py`) and run the script using the command `python test_has_close_elements.py`. 

This will execute the test cases and provide feedback on whether the function is correct or generates any error.  This way, you can validate the correctness of your function and have a reliable test suite for future experiments, especially if you make changes to the function's code.  If you are working with a terminal, you will see the results printed on the console, or you can review them in the integrated development environment (IDE) you are using.  In addition, in this code, the `unittest.main()` function is essential since it is what allows the discovery and running of the tests.  This function is only executable when the script is run directly and not imported as a module, which is why it is essential to only execute those lines if the script is indeed run directly.  This is why the `if __name__ == '__main__'` construct is included in the code.  This ensures that `unittest.main()` only runs if the script is executed directly by the OS, but not if it is imported as a module.  Finally, it's essential to divide the test suite into individual test methods so that each test case can be executed independently and selectively if needed.  This makes it easy to run specific tests if you need to focus on a particular aspect of the function's behavior.  This also helps to facilitate the identification of whether the function satisfies the test cases and therefore meets the problem requirements.  Generally, it is a good practice to have comprehensive test coverage to ensure the full correctness of the function.  This includes having tests for different input scenarios, like here, with different input lists and threshold values, to cover all potential edge cases as well.  This is key to ensure that the function has indeed the expected behavior and works correctly for all scenarios.  This approach helps to catch bugs early during the development process and avoids potential errors in production environments.  Finally, this approach makes testing more accessible, faster, and more efficient since it reduces the likelihood of errors that can cause bugs in your code.  This is part of the testing best practices
