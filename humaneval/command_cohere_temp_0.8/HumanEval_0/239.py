```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of floats `numbers` and a threshold `threshold`. It uses the `any()` function with a generator expression to check if any adjacent elements in the list have a difference less than the threshold. The generator expression, `abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` iterates through pairs of adjacent elements in the list, calculating the absolute difference between them and checking if it is less than the threshold.

To see how the function works let's take this example:
```python
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))
```

The output will be `False` because there are no adjacent elements that are closer to each other than 0.5. 

And for this example:
```python
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))
```

The output will be `True` because the difference between `2.0` and `2.8` is `0.8`, which is less than the threshold `0.3`. 

This function conveniently and efficiently checks if any elements in the list have adjacent elements that are close enough, based on a given threshold.
