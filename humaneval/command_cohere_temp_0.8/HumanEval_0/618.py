```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of floats `numbers` and a threshold `threshold` and returns a boolean value `True` if there are any adjacent elements in the list whose difference is less than the threshold, `False` otherwise. 

To prove its correctness, here is a simple test case:
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
```
The result is false because none of the differences are less than 0.5. 

And another example where it returns `True`:
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```
The result is true because adjacent elements 2.0 and 2.8 differ by 0.8 which is less than the threshold 0.3.
