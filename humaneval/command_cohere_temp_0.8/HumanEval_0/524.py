```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of floats `numbers` and a threshold `threshold` as input. It returns a boolean indicating whether any two elements in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. It uses a list comprehension, and the `any()` and `zip()` functions to check if any two elements in the list have a difference less than the threshold. 

To test this function, you can use the following inputs:
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```

This should return `False` for the first example and `True` for the second, corresponding with the provided examples from the problem statement. 

This approach is quite efficient because it uses Python's built-in zipper to iterate pairs of list elements and uses a boolean `any` clause to check for truthfulness, avoiding the need for explicit loops.  It operates in O(n) time complexity, where `n` is the length of the input list.
