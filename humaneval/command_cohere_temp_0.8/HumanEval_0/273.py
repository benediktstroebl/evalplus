```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function takes a list of floats `numbers` and a threshold value `threshold` as input. It returns `True` if there exist two elements in the list that are less than `threshold` apart in value, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a zipper operation to compare each element in the list to every other element, and the any function to check if any of these comparisons are less than the threshold. 
The zipper operation, `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`, takes the first element from the list and pairs it with the corresponding element of the remaining list, resulting in the pairs (`a`, `b`) for each `a` from the first elements and `b` from the following elements. Then, the absolute difference is less than the threshold, `abs(a - b)<threshold`, is checked for each pair, and it is asked if any of these differences are less than the threshold. 
The function would be reusable and efficiently solve the described problem, and it can be integrated into a testing framework to ensure robust functionality going forward. Mentioned below is a sample input-output example:
```
input: numbers = [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], threshold = 0.3
output: True
```
```
input: numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], threshold = 0.5
output: False
```
