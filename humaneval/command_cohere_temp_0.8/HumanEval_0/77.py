```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` uses the `any` function to check if there are any elements in the list that are less than the threshold. The `any` function returns `True` if any element of the list is `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`. This is combined with the `zip` function to check if any of the differences yield a result less than the threshold. 

This solution is self-contained and solves the problem description provided using Python's built-in typing and functionality. Let me know if it fits the requirements or if you'd like to go through another approach.
