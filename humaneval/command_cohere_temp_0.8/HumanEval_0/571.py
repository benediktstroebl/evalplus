```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function relies on the use of a generator expression, which is a compact way of writing a concise one-liner using the `any()` function. 

To efficiently process lists, it is important to know how to write clean one-liner functions. 

This solution has a manageable code size, is easily understandable, and is computationally efficient for large lists.
