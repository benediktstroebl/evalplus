```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, it uses the `any` function with a lambda function to check for each pair of numbers if they are closer than the threshold, the `zip` function is used to iterate over the list of numbers, returning only one false result immediately halts the `any` function and returns `False`, and in the case that none of the pairs exceeds the threshold, it continues checking pairs until it finds a pair that is less than the threshold, returning `True`. 

To ensure its functionality, below is a basic unit test and a complete integration test: 
```python
import unittest

class TestHasCloseElements(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_no_elements(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([], 1.0))

    def test_no_close_elements(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))

    def test_with_close_elements(self):
        self.assertTrue(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this test suite, there is a unit test that checks the behavior of the function with an empty list and a threshold of `1.0`, the expectation is `False`, there is also a test that checks the behavior with a list of numbers with no close elements, ensuring that the result is `False`, and finally, an integration test that checks if the function returns `True` with a list that contains close elements, in this case, the threshold is `0.3` and the expectation is `True`. 

To run these tests just run the script and these will be executed.
