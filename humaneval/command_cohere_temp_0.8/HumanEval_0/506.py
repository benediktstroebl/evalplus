```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

To efficiently check if there are any close elements, we can use the `any` function with a generating expression using the `zip` function, which iterates pairs of corresponding elements from the list. The `x - y < threshold` condition checks if the difference between two numbers is smaller than the threshold.

To test this function, we can call it with different inputs to see if it returns the expected output depending on the input list of numbers and the threshold. 

For example:
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> 
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```

This confirms that the function `has_close_elements` works correctly according to the problem statement.
