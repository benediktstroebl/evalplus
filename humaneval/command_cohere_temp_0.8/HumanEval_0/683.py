```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function examines each element in the list in relation to the other elements, taking advantage of the assumption that elements in lists are numerically ordered. 

To test this algorithm, you can create a simple test with a hard-coded input and expected output like so:
```python
# Test case for has_close_elements function
def test_has_close_elements():
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) == True
```

This test case provides a list of numerically ordered numbers and a small threshold value to check whether the function behaves as expected. The expected output is `True` since all numbers except for the first are within `0.3` of each other, as denoted by the `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` statement.
