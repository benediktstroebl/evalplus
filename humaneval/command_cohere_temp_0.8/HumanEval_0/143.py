```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function employs a zipper operation, `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`, to pair each number with the subsequent number. The `any` function then checks if there exists a pair whose difference is less than the threshold.

To see this function in action, you can call it with different lists of numbers and thresholds, such as:
```python
has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
```

This will return `False` and `True`, respectively, given that the first list does not contain numbers that are closer than 0.5 units, while the second list does contain numbers that are closer than 0.3 units.

This approach ensures a concise one-liner that solves the given problem efficiently and intuitively.
