Here's a Python script that contains a function called has_close_elements, which takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function works correctly and passes the provided tests. The code is formatted as a markdown code block:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    """
    numbers.sort()
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i] < threshold:
            return True
    return False

# Tests
numbers_list = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
threshold = 0.5

print(has_close_elements(numbers_list, threshold))  # False

numbers_list = [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
threshold = 0.3

print(has_close_elements(numbers_list, threshold))  # True
```
This code defines the `has_close_elements` function and tests it with two test cases, which correspond to the examples provided in the problem statement. The function sorts the input list of numbers and then iterates through the list, checking if the difference between each element and the subsequent element is smaller than the given threshold. If any such pair is found, it returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`.  The output of the code is:
```
False
True
```
