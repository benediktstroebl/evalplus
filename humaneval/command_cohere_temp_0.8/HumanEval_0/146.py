```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) <= threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function relies on the use of a generator expression, created by yielding elements from the result of the `zip` function, to iterate through all pairs of elements in the list and compare them using the inequality.

To test this script, you can create a separate test file, or integrate your tests into the script itself using frameworks like `pytest`.

For instance, you can add a `test_has_close_elements` function inside your script:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    # Test with example where there are no close elements
    assert not has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)

    # Test with example where there is a close element
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
```

This way, the `has_close_elements` function is tested against specific conditions, and future modifications to the function will not break these tests as long as the desired behavior is maintained.
