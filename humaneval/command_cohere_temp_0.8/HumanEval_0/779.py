```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as parameters. It uses the `any()` function with a generator expression to check if any of the differences between consecutive elements in the list are less than the threshold. The use of `any()` is necessary to handle the case when there might be multiple close elements in the list. The generator expression, `x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` calculates the difference between consecutive elements in the list, iterating through the entries sequentially using the `zip()` function.

To ensure proper usage of the function, there are two test cases for the problem statement in the corresponding test file:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) == True
```

These tests ensure that the function `has_close_elements()` correctly identifies whether there are elements in the list that are closer than the specified threshold.
