Here's a Python script that contains a function called has_close_elements, which takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function works correctly and passes the provided tests. The code is formatted as a markdown code block:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    """
    numbers.sort()
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i] < threshold:
            return True
    return False

# Tests
numbers_list = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
threshold = 0.5

print(has_close_elements(numbers_list, threshold))  # Output: False

numbers_list = [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
threshold = 0.3

print(has_close_elements(numbers_list, threshold))  # Output: True
```

The function has_close_elements will soon be explained and differentiated. The two tests, despite passing the function, can be used to illustrate how it works and what the function is supposed to do. To learn more about the purpose of the function, please refer to the comments provided inside the function. 

The 'has_close_elements' function sorts a given list of numbers in ascending order and then iterates through the list, checking each element's proximity to the subsequent element. The function returns True if any element's distance from the following element is less than the provided threshold, indicating that the list contains close elements. Otherwise, it returns False. This functionality aids in determining whether unusual coincidences occur within a list of numbers.
