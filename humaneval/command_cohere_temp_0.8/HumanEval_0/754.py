```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes two arguments; a list of numbers and a threshold. It uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if any element in the list differs from its neighboring element by less than the threshold. The `zip` function is used to iterate over neighboring elements and the `x - y` expression calculates the difference between two neighboring elements `x` and `y`. 

To see this problem's test cases and how to execute them, you can use this script:
```python
import unittest

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))

class TestHasCloseElements(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_no_close_elements(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))

    def test_with_close_elements(self):
        self.assertTrue(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this script, the `TestHasCloseElements` class derives from `unittest.TestCase` and has two test methods. In `test_no_close_elements`, the assertion `self.assertFalse` indicates that the list `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]` has no elements that are close to each other with the given threshold of 0.5 and in `test_with_close_elements` the assertion `self.assertTrue` indicates that the list `[1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]` has elements that are close to each other with the given threshold of 0.3. 

To run these tests you can add the corresponding markdown code block at the end of the script or simply execute the script in an environment that supports Markdown and Python.
