```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of floats `numbers` and a threshold `threshold` as input. It uses the `any()` function with a generator expression to check if there exist two numbers in the list that are less than the threshold apart in value. The generator expression, `x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` checks if, for each pair of elements in `numbers`, the difference between them is smaller than the threshold. The `zip()` function pairs up the elements of the list, and the `any()` function returns `True` if any of the differences are smaller than the threshold, indicating that there are close elements in the list.
