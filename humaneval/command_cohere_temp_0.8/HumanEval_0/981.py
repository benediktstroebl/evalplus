```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) <= threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of floats `numbers` and a threshold value `threshold` and returns a boolean indicating whether any two elements in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. It uses a generator expression, formulated as a list comprehension but not materialized into a list, to iterate through all pairs of elements in the list and checks if their absolute difference is less or equal to the threshold with the `any()` function.

To see the function in action, you can call it with various input tests as demonstrated in the original problem:
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
``` 

This demonstrates that the function can correctly determine whether elements in a given list are close together in terms of a threshold value.
