```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function checks if the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list is smaller than the threshold.

To confirm the correctness of the algorithm, below is a simple test case:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    # True when list has two elements with difference less than 0.5
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) == True
    # False when list has no elements with difference less than 1.0
    assert has_close_elements([10.0, 20.0, 30.0], 1.0) == False
```

This test case checks if the function returns `True` for a list with elements that are closer than the threshold and `False` for a list with no elements closer than the threshold.
