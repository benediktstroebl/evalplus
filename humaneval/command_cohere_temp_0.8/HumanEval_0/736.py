```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs. It uses the `any()` function with a generator expression to check if any elements in the list are closer than the threshold to each other. The generator expression, `x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` checks if the difference between consecutive pairs of elements in the list is smaller than the threshold `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` pairs up the list with the element at index `1` and onwards (thus, consecutive elements) and calculates the difference between each pair, and `< threshold` checks if the difference is smaller than the threshold.

To test this function, you can use the following sample inputs and expected outputs:
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```
This test validates that the function correctly solves the problem.
