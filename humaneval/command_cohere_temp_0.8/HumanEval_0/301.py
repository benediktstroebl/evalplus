```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function employs a generator expression (`zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`), which iterates over pairs of elements in the list. The `any` function then checks if any of the differences between the pairs is less than the given threshold.

To see the function in action, you can call it with specific examples, as demonstrated in the given problem statement.

For instance, let's consider the first example provided in the problem statement:
```python
has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
# Output: False
```
This output is obtained since none of the differences between the numbers in this list (`1.0`, `2.0`, and `3.0`) is less than 0.5.

For the second example:
```python
has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
# Output: True
```
This returns `True` since the difference between the second and third numbers in the list (`2.8 - 3.0 = -0.2`) is less than the 0.3 threshold.
