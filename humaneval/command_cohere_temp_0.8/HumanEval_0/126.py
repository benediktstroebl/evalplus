```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold value as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

To demonstrate the function, here is an example of usage:
```python
# Example usage
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
threshold = 0.3

print(has_close_elements(numbers, threshold))
```

Output:
```bash
True
```

In this example, the list `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]` contains the numbers 2 and 5, which are less than `threshold = 0.3` units apart. Hence, the function returns `True`. 

This function implements the solution in a straightforward manner and is encapsulated for easy usage. It can be used as a building block for more complex algorithms that require comparisons within a list of numbers. 

If you would like to test this function against edge cases, I can provide a few test cases to verify its robustness. Let me know if you would like me to integrate this function into a testing framework like `unittest` or provide more examples of its usage.
