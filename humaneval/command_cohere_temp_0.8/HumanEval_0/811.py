```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function checks if any elements in the list are close by iterating over all unique couples of elements using the `zip` function, and checking if the difference between the elements in each couple is smaller than the threshold.

To ensure that the function behaves as expected, let's write a few test cases that demonstrate the function's behavior for different inputs:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    # True when list has elements closer than threshold
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) == True
    # False when list has no elements closer than threshold
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) == False
    # Edge case: single element list
    assert has_close_elements([1.0], 1.0) == False
   
```
