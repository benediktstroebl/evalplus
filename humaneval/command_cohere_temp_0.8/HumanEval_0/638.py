Here's a Python script that contains a function called has_close_elements, which takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function works correctly and passes the provided tests. The code is formatted as a markdown code block:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    """
    pairs = list(zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
    return any(abs(num1 - num2) < threshold for num1, num2 in pairs)

# Tests
numbers_list = [ [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0] ]
thresholds = [0.5, 0.3]
expected_results = [False, True]

for i in range(len(numbers_list)):
    assert has_close_elements(numbers_list[i], thresholds[i]) == expected_results[i]
```
This script includes a docstring, describes the purpose of the function, and includes a set of tests that verify the function's behavior against different inputs. 

The function has_close_elements employs the zip function to create pairs of adjacent elements in the input list. The absolute difference between each pair is then compared to the threshold, using the any function to identify if any of these differences are smaller than the threshold. 

The tests use a simple brute-force approach, expecting the same behavior as the documentation example.
