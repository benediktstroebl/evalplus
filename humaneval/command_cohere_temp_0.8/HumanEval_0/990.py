```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes two arguments; a list of numbers and a threshold. It uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if any element in the list differs from its adjacent element by less than the threshold. The generator expression, `x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` iterates through the list of numbers, taking adjacent pairs of elements and subtracting them. The result is then checked against the threshold. 

This solution can be improved if the list is long by using a more efficient approach like sorting the list and performing a binary search.
