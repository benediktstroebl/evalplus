```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function checks if there are any consecutive elements in a list of numbers that are closer together than a given threshold. It does this by using a generator expression, which is a compact way of writing a for loop in Python. It checks each element in the list minus the next element to see if the difference is less than the threshold. The any function is then used to see if any of these differences are smaller than the threshold. 

To use this function, you can import it into a Python script and call it with a list of numbers and a threshold value. For example:
```python
import sys
sys.path.append("..")
from mylib import has_close_elements

print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))
```
This will print:
```bash
False
True
```

You also can include this function in a unit test suite to test its behavior against various cases. Here is an example of how to do this in Python using the built-in `unittest` module:
```python
import unittest
from mylib import has_close_elements

class TestHasCloseElements(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_no_close_elements(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))

    def test_with_close_elements(self):
        self.assertTrue(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This code provides a test suite with two test cases, `test_no_close_elements` and `test_with_close_elements`, each of which tests a particular scenario in the `has_close_elements` function. You can ensure your function behaves as expected and is correctly solving the problem by running this code. 

The `unittest.main()` function is used to discover and run the test cases automatically when the script is run as a standalone program.
