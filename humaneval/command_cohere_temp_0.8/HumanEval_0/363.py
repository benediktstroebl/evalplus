```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` checks if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer than the given threshold by using a generator expression that iterates pairs of elements in the list and compares their differences with the threshold.

This solution allows for a more efficient search through the list without the need for explicit loop indices, as the generator expression takes care of iterating through elements and calculating differences internally. 

To validate the functionality of the solution, you can use the following tests:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) == True

    # With single item list
    assert has_close_elements([1.0], 0.1) == False

    # With float threshold
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 2.0) == False

test_has_close_elements()
```

These tests cover different scenarios of input lists and threshold values to ensure the function `has_close_elements` behaves as expected.
