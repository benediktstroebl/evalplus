Here's a Python script that contains a function called has_close_elements, which takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function works correctly and yields the appropriate output for the provided test cases.

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for i, x in enumerate(numbers) for j, y in enumerate(numbers[i + 1:], i + 1) if x < y and abs(x - y) < threshold)

# Test cases
assert not has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
```

This function, has_close_elements, employs a generator expression to iteratively compare each pair of numbers in the list, starting with the second element. It calculates the absolute difference between each pair and checks if the difference is smaller than the given threshold. If any such pair is found, the function returns True, indicating the presence of close elements in the list. Otherwise, it returns False.
