Here's a Python script that contains a function called has_close_elements, which takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function works correctly and passes the given tests. The code is formatted as a markdown code block:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    """
    numbers.sort()
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i] < threshold:
            return True
    return False

# Tests
numbers_list = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
threshold = 0.5

print(has_close_elements(numbers_list, threshold))  # False

numbers_list = [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
threshold = 0.3

print(has_close_elements(numbers_list, threshold))  # True
```
This code defines the `has_close_elements` function and tests it with two test cases, which correspond to the given tests. 
The first test case verifies the function with a list of numbers [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] and a threshold of 0.5, and the function returns False.

The second test case verifies the function with a list of numbers [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0] and a threshold of 0.3, and the function returns True.

Given that the code passes these tests, it effectively solves the problem and can be used to efficiently check whether any two numbers in a list are closer to each other than a specified threshold. 

To better understand how the algorithm works a breakdown of the code is provided below:
1. The `has_close_elements` function takes two parameters: numbers, which is a list of floating numbers, and threshold, which is a float representing the minimum distance between two numbers for them to be considered close.
2. The function uses the sorting function to sort the input list of numbers. This allows it to efficiently check adjacent elements in the list.
3. The function then iterates over the sorted list using a loop. It starts from the first element and moves to the second element, then the third, and so on.
4. For each iteration, it checks if the difference between the current element and the next element is less than the provided threshold. If it is, it means that these two numbers are close enough, so the function returns True to indicate that there are close elements in the list.
5. If the loop completes without finding any adjacent elements that are closer than the threshold, the function returns False. 

This approach takes advantage of the sorted list to perform efficient element comparisons. Additionally, the use of a loop simplifies the logic and makes the function more efficient, as it doesn't require additional algorithms like `heapq`.
