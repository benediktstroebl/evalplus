```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) <= threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function employs a `zip` operation to iterate over each number in the list in combination with the `list[1:]` slicing trick to avoid comparing a number with itself. The `any` function then checks for the condition of the absolute difference between two consecutive numbers in the list being smaller than or equal to the threshold. 

To ensure the function behaves correctly, tests are pivotal. Below is a simple test suite for the function:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    # True case
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 0.0], 1.0) == True

    # False case
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], 2.0) == False

test_has_close_elements()
```

Adding test cases like these help to increase coverage and ensure the function's correctness across different scenarios. If the code changes in the future, these tests act as a safety net to catch any unintended regressions.
