```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs. It uses the `any()` function with a generator expression to check if there exist two elements in the list that are closer together than the threshold. The generator expression, `x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`, iterates through pairs of elements in the list, subtracting them pairwise and comparing the differences to the threshold.

To see how it works in action, let's have a look at a few test cases:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    # Case 1: No two elements are close enough
    assert not has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)

    # Case 2: Two elements are close enough
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)

    # Case 3: List with only two elements
    assert not has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0], 0.1)
```

In the first test case, we check that with a threshold of 0.5 and a list of integers [1, 2, 3], the result is `False` since no two elements are close enough compared to the threshold. In the second test case, the result is `True` since the list [1, 2.8, 3, 4, 5, 2] contains elements 2 and 2.8 that are closer than the 0.3 threshold. Finally, in the third case, even though the list contains only two elements, the function returns `False` because the threshold is 0.1 and neither element is within that threshold of the other. 

To sum it up, the function `has_close_elements()` is able to effectively determine whether any elements in a given list of numbers are close to each other, according to a specified threshold.
