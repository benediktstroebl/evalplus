```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of floats and a threshold as parameters, and returns `True` if there exist two elements in the list such that their difference is less than the threshold, and `False` otherwise.

To ensure that the function handles the input correctly, we will generate a test suite that covers different scenarios. Let's start with two simple tests that cover the edge cases of the problem statement:
```python
def test_has_close_elements_when_true():
    # Test case sourced from problem statement
    nums = [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
    thresh = 0.3
    expected = True
    actual = has_close_elements(nums, thresh)
    assert actual == expected

def test_has_close_elements_when_false():
    # Test case sourced from problem statement
    nums = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
    thresh = 0.5
    expected = False
    actual = has_close_elements(nums, thresh)
    assert actual == expected
```

The first test consists of a list of numbers with a close element and a threshold of `0.3`, and the second test consists of a list of numbers without a close element and a threshold of `0.5`. 

We use the `zip` function to create pairs of numbers from the list `nums` for the `has_close_elements` function. For each pair of numbers, we subtract one from the other and compare this difference to the threshold. 

The expected result is then compared to the actual result using `assert`. 

This test suite can be run using a Python test runner like `pytest`.
