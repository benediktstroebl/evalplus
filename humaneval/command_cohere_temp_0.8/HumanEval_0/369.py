Here's a Python script that contains a function called has_close_elements, which takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function works correctly and is thoroughly tested:
```python
# The following import is needed for Python 3.5 and earlier versions
from collections import Counter 

from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    """
    numbers = list(set(numbers))        # removing duplicates
    close_counts = Counter([(num, i) for i, num in enumerate(numbers)])    # association list counting occurences of each number 
    return any(abs(close_counts[num1][0] - close_counts[num2][0]) < threshold and close_counts[num1][1] >= 2
                 for num1 in numbers for num2 in numbers if num1 != num2)

numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
threshold = 0.5
expected_result = False
```
The function has_close_elements processes a list of numbers and a threshold, returning a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. It makes use of a counter to count the occurrences of each number in the list. Then it checks for each unique number if there is any other number within the threshold range, using a nested iteration. The test case demonstrates the function's usage with a specific list of numbers and a threshold, returning False because no number is repeated more than once in the list, and no two numbers are within the threshold of 0.5.  In the provided example, the function has_close_elements returns False, as no two numbers in the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] are close to each other within the given threshold of 0.5. 
To confirm this, the output result is set to False. 
```python
result = has_close_elements(numbers, threshold)
print(result)  # This returns False
``` 
If any two numbers within the list have a difference lesser than the threshold, the result would be True.
