```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` checks if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer to each other than the provided threshold. It uses a list comprehension, which is a powerful tool in Python that allows you to create a new list based on the values of an existing list after applying a specific operation/condition on each element. In this case, it checks if the difference between neighboring elements in the list is smaller than the threshold. The any function is a built-in Python function that checks if any element in a list is true, so in this case, it's verifying if any of the elements in the list comprehension returns True. 

To use this function properly, ensure that you have imported the List module from Python's typing toolkit, which must be done to enforce proper type-checking. You can do this either in the cell preceding the cell where you are running your function, or in the cell where you are defining your function.
