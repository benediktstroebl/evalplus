```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

To efficiently check if any close elements exist in the list, we utilize the `any` function with a generating expression using the `zip` function, which pairs each element in the list with the subsequent element. The subtraction `x - y` yields the difference between two adjacent elements, and checking if it's less than the threshold (`< threshold`) lets us quickly determine if any adjacent elements are closer than the given threshold.

This approach ensures that the function is efficient, not requiring additional iterations over the list or excessive computations. It neatly encapsulates the solution to the problem in a concise and readable manner.
