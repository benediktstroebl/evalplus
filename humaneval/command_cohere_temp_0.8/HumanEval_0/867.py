```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function takes a list of floats `numbers` and a threshold value `threshold` as input. It returns `True` if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the `threshold`, and `False` otherwise. 

To test these assumptions, the function uses the `any` construction with a generator expression. This expression is a shortened way of saying "Is any element in list numbers closer than threshold to any other element in the same list, excluding the first one?" 

The test cases provided in the original prompt return the following results:
- `has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)` returns `False`
- `has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)` returns `True`

These results conform to the assumptions made in the original problem description. 
If desired, I can provide a simple testing module for this function or explain how such a testing module could be created. Please let me know if you'd like to proceed in this direction.
