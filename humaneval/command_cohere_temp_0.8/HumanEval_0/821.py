```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function checks if there exist any two numbers in a list of numbers that are closer to each other than a given threshold. It uses a generator expression, constructed using the zip function, to iteratively subtract pairs of numbers in the list `numbers` and checks if any of the differences are less than the given `threshold`. The any function is then used to determine if any of these differences are smaller, and hence if the criterion is fulfilled. 

To ensure that the function has correctly implemented the described behaviour, we can write a test like this:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    # True case
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) == True

    # False case
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) == False
```
This test suite contains two tests, one asserting the function's correctness for a case where the criterion is fulfilled (close elements exist), and another for a case where the criterion is not fulfilled. 

To validate the correctness of this solution, it is a good practice to execute these tests using a testing framework like `pytest`.
