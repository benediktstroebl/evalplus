```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold value as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

To demonstrate the function, here is an example of usage:
```python
# Test Cases
assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) == False

assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) == True
```

The test cases validate the function with positive and negative examples. This general problem can be thought of as a simple routine task to assess data points in datasets for various applications and computer vision-related tasks, for example, detecting similar pixels in an image or similar audio signals in audio processing.
