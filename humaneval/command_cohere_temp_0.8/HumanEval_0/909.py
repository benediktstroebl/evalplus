```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes two arguments; a list of numbers and a threshold. It uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if any element in the list is closer to any other element than the threshold. The generator expression, `x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` creates a list of pairs for each element in the list and checks if the difference is less than the threshold. The `zip` function short-circuits the iteration and only goes through the list once, resulting in pairs of elements. 

This function will return `True` if there are any elements that are closer than the threshold and `False` otherwise. 

To handle the edge case where the list has only one element, we can modify the function to check if the absolute difference between the list element and zero is less than the threshold. 

```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return abs(numbers[0]) < threshold
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
``` 

This modified version uses the `abs` function to calculate the distance between the element and zero.
