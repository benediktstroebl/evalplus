```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as parameters. It uses the `any()` function with a generator expression to check if any element in the list differs from its neighboring element by less than the threshold. The expression `x - y < threshold` checks if the absolute difference between two consecutive elements is less than the threshold `threshold`. The generator expression `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` pairs each element in the list with its subsequent element (skipping the last element if it exists).

To see how this function can be applied, check out the following:
```python
# Test case 1
assert not has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)

# Test case 2
assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
```

The first test case checks if the list `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]` contains elements that are close together with the threshold of `0.5`. The expected result is `False`, meaning that none of the elements in the list are close to each other as per the defined threshold. The second test case checks if the list `[1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]` contains elements that are close together with the threshold of `0.3`. The expected result for this test case is `True`, meaning that there is a pair of elements that are closer to each other than the defined threshold. 

These tests check the functionality of the `has_close_elements()` function with different inputs and verify that it returns the correct results. 

NOTE: List comprehension or the `any` clause with a generator expression are not the only ways to tackle this problem. Feel free to experiment with other ways to achieve the desired result, but make sure that the chosen approach is compatible with the problem requirements and Python norms.
