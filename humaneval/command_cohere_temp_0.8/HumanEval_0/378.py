```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for i, x in enumerate(numbers) for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)) for y in numbers[j])
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function employs a list comprehension that checks all pairs of elements in the list, leveraging the `enumerate` function to iterate over both elements and indices. The `abs` function is then used to calculate the absolute difference between the pairs, with the comprehension finally checking if any of these differences are smaller than the given threshold. 

This approach enables efficient and concise code, directly handling the given problem statement.
