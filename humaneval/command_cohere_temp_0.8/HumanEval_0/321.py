```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

To demonstrate the function, here is an example of usage:
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```

This example validates the correct behavior of the function, as the first example returns False, since none of the elements are less than 0.5 apart, while the second example returns True, since 2.0 and 2.8 are less than 0.3 apart. 

This function can be further modified to optimize the loop or to handle different threshold types (e.g. a threshold range).
