```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs. It uses the `any()` function with a generator expression to check if any adjacent elements in the list have a difference less than the threshold. The generator expression, `abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` iterates through pairs of adjacent elements in the list, calculates the absolute difference between the pairs, and checks if the difference is less than the threshold.

To see how the code works let's break it down with an example:
```python
numbers = [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
threshold = 0.3

has_close_elements(numbers, threshold)
# True
```

In this example, we have the list `[1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]` and a threshold value of `0.3`. The function will check if there are any adjacent elements in the list that are closer than the threshold, by comparing each pair of adjacent elements in the list. For this particular list, when we iterate through pairs of adjacent elements, we find that `2.8 - 1.0 = 1.8` which is greater than the threshold. Meanwhile, `5.0 - 2.0 = 3.0` which is also greater than the threshold. As the condition is fulfilled, the generator expression returns `True` which causes the `any()` function to return `True`. 

Therefore, the function returns `True` as there are adjacent elements closer than the threshold. 

This approach takes advantage of the short-circuiting behavior of `any()`, where it returns `True` as soon as it finds a `True` value in the iterable, and `False` if all elements are `False`. 

Note that the function assumes that the list contains at least two elements, as it is checking for adjacent elements, and a single element list would not have any adjacent elements.
