Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
The `has_close_elements` function takes two parameters; a list of numbers and a threshold. It uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if any element in the list differs from its neighboring element by less than the threshold. The generator expression, `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`, pairs each element with its subsequent element. The `abs()` function then gives the absolute value of the difference between the two elements in each pair. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))
```
This would output:
```
False
True
```

This script solves the problem while maintaining the given complexity requirements.
