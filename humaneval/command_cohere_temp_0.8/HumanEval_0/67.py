```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) <= threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function takes a list of floats `numbers` and a float `threshold` as input. It returns `True` if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the `threshold`, and `False` otherwise. It does this by using a generator expression, which iterates pairs of elements in the list using `zip`, and checks if the absolute difference between the pairs is less than or equal to the `threshold`. The `any` function then checks if any of these pairs pass the condition. 

To ensure that the function behaves as expected, let's write a few test cases to validate its correctness. These tests can be added to the script to verify the function's behavior:
```python
# Test case to check if function behaves correctly when no two elements are close
def test_no_close_elements():
    numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
    threshold = 0.5
    expected = False
    actual = has_close_elements(numbers, threshold)
    assert actual == expected, f"Expected {expected}, but got {actual}"

# Test case to check if function behaves correctly when a pair of elements is close
numbers = [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
threshold = 0.3
expected = True
actual = has_close_elements(numbers, threshold)
assert actual == expected, f"Expected {expected}, but got {actual}"
```

Adding these test cases will ensure that the `has_close_elements` function behaves as expected and aligns with the problem statement. 
The first test case checks if the function correctly identifies that no two elements in the list are closer than the threshold, while the second test case checks if the function correctly identifies that a pair of elements are close, thereby passing the specified threshold. 

To execute these tests and verify if the function has_close_elements behaves as expected, add these test cases to the script and run the file. These tests can be run using any Python testing framework like `pytest`.
