```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) <= threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This Python script defines a function called `has_close_elements`, which takes two arguments: a list of floating numbers called `numbers` and a threshold value also defined as `threshold`. 

The function returns `True` if there are any pairs of elements in the list whose absolute difference is less than or equal to the threshold, and it returns `False` otherwise. 

This behavior is illustrated in the function's docstring, which includes example usage and outputs to demonstrate how the function works.
