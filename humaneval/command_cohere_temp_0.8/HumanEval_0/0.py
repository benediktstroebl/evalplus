```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

This function takes a list of floats `numbers` and a float `threshold` as input and returns a boolean that indicates whether any two elements in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function employs a generator expression utilizing the `zip` function to pair each number in the list with each subsequent number to check whether their absolute difference is smaller than the threshold. The `any` function then checks if any of these differences are smaller than the threshold and returns the corresponding boolean. 

This approach enables the function to efficiently and accurately determine whether two or more elements in the list are close to each other within the specified threshold. 

You can test this function using the following:
```python
test_has_close_elements_true = [( [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5),  (# True
                                       ( [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  (# False
                                  ]
test_has_close_elements_false = [( [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 1.0),  (# False
                                    ( [1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], 1.0))  (# False
                                 ( [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], 0.4))  (# True
                              ]
``` 

This provides straightforward tests for both true and false conditions. 

There are many approaches that you can employ to solve this problem involving loops, generator expressions, and list comprehensions. Each approach has its own trade-offs in terms of readability, efficiency, and maintaining singular loop variables.  This particular solution opts for the use of generator expressions and the `any` function for its efficiency and simplicity.
