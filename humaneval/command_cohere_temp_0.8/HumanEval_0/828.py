```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes two arguments; a list of numbers and a threshold. It uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if any of the differences between consecutive elements in the list are less than the threshold. The use of `any` reduces code clutter and is suitable for this case as it is designed to handle boolean arrays and can efficiently handle iterables like list comprehensions.

To see it in action, you can call the function with specific inputs:
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```
