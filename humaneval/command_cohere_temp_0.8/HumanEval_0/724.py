```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

To efficiently check if any two elements in a list are closer to each other with a given threshold, the function `has_close_elements` uses the `any` function in combination with a generator expression. A generator expression, `x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`, is executed within the `any` function, where `zip` combines each element with every subsequent element as a tuple, and then the inequality checks if the difference between the values of these tuples is smaller than the provided threshold. If any of these inequalities are `True`, the `any` function will return `True`, indicating that the condition of close elements has been satisfied. 

This approach allows the function to check all possible pairs of elements in the list efficiently, without the need for a nested loop structure that increases computational complexity.
