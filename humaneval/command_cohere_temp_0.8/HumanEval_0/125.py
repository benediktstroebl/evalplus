```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as parameters, it uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if any adjacent elements in the list have a difference less than the threshold. The use of `any` reduces the complexity to `O(n)` from the potential `O(n^2)`  worst-case complexity of the naive approach.  The generator expression, `(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))` will iterate over pairs of adjacent elements in the list, calculating the absolute difference between them and checking if it is less than the threshold. If any of these differences is less than or equal to the threshold, the `any` function will return `True`, indicating that there are close elements in the list. Otherwise, it returns `False`.  This approach is more efficient, especially for large lists, as it avoids nested loops and reduces the time complexity to `O(n)`.
