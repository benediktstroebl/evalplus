```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function checks if any elements in the list are close by iterating over all unique couples of elements using the `zip()` function, and checking if the difference between the elements in each couple is smaller than the threshold.

To make the function more readable, we use the `any()` function to short-circuit the iteration as soon as a couple satisfies the condition. 

The function's behavior is demonstrated in the docstring using example inputs and expected outputs. 

This script guarantees a binary consequence (i.e., consistently yields a result entailing True or False) and directly returns the truth value as the result, making it fully self-contained. 

To test this script, you can call the function with various inputs and compare the results to the examples provided in the docstring.  For example:
```python
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # Expected: False
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # Expected: True
``` 
The script will pass if the output is True for the first example and False for the second.  This provides a basic introduction to unit testing in Python, where scripts are evaluated with multiple inputs and expected outputs to confirm their correctness.
