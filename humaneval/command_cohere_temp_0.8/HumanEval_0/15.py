Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
The function `has_close_elements` takes two parameters: 
1. `numbers`: A list of floating numbers
2. `threshold`: A floating threshold value.

The function returns `True` if there are two elements in the list that are less than the threshold apart, and `False` otherwise. 

This is achieved using the `any` function combined with a generator expression. The generator expression `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` pairs each element in the list with the following element, and the `abs` function calculates the absolute difference between the pairs. When the absolute difference is smaller than the threshold, the condition is satisfied, and the `any` function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

The `has_close_elements` function can be tested as follows:
```python
# Test case 1
assert not has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)

# Test case 2
assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
```
This script provides a self-contained function that solves the problem and can be easily tested and transported to other projects.  It would be sensible to add more tests to further illustrate the behaviour of the function with diverse inputs.  If the problem allows for more test cases, it is often a good idea to create them in order to cover a variety of scenarios and corner cases.  This ensures the function is robust and prepared for actual usage in diverse contexts.  If you want to improve your function or create custom pre-commit and pre-push checks, you might want to consider adding the tests to a separate testing file (e.g., `test_has_close_elements.py`).  This way, your codebase will be better organized and maintained.  Also, if your project is open to the public, these tests would help you to provide confidence to your users that the code follows the expected behavior.  Finally, consider including this function in a larger project, so that you can use it to accomplish more complicated tasks and make your code more modular and reusable.  This adheres to the principle of separation of concerns and helps you to design better and more maintainable projects.  It also promotes reusability and could help you to reduce coding time for related activities in the future.  You could also take this opportunity to identify other functionalities that could be abstracted as separate functions or classes, in order to improve the organization and clarity of your project as a whole.  This is a recommended practice for the initial stages of development of a project (i.e., during the prototyping phase).
