```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` uses the `any` function to check if there are any elements in the list that are less than the threshold. The `zip` function is used to iterate over pairs of elements in the list. The difference between each pair is computed and the check against the threshold is performed. 

To ensure this function works as expected with different inputs, you could consider writing tests leveraging the `unittest` module or testing frameworks such as `pytest`. Below is an example of using `unittest` to verify the function behavior:
```python
import unittest

from typing import List
from has_close_elements import has_close_elements

class HasCloseElementsTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_close_elements(self):
        self.assertTrue(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))

    def test_not_close_elements(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In the above code, `unittest` is employed to organize test cases and automatically run them. The `HasCloseElementsTestCase` class inherits from `unittest.TestCase` and defines two test methods, `'test_close_elements'` and `'test_not_close_elements'`, to respectively verify the function behavior against correct and incorrect inputs. 

When executed, the `unittest` module automatically runs all the defined tests and outputs the results, allowing you to confidently ascertain that the function adheres to the expected behavior. 

You can run this test suite by adding the following line to the script:
```python
unittest.main()
```

To use this script, you can add the entire folder to the Python path or copy the `has_close_elements.py` file to the current working directory. 

Note: This code assumes the `has_close_elements` function is defined in a separate file named `has_close_elements.py`, which is located in the same directory as the test file. If the function is located in a different file, the test file must be modified accordingly.
