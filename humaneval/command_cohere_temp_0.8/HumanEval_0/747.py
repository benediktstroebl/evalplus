```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) <= threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function `has_close_elements` works by checking if there's any pair of elements in the list where the difference between them is less than the given threshold. It does this using a generator expression, which allows us to do element-wise comparisons efficiently. The `any` function then checks if any of these comparisons are true, and returns `True` if so. 

To ensure that the function is correct, and to test edge cases, we can create a test suite with different inputs and expected outputs. Here's an example:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    # True when numbers are closely spaced
    assert has_close_elements([1, 2, 3, 4], 1)
    assert has_close_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7,8,9], 2)
    assert has_close_elements([1, 4, 3, 4, 1], 1)

    # False when numbers are spaced out
    assert not has_close_elements([1, 2, 3, 5], 2)
    assert not has_close_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7,8,9,10], 1)

    # Edge case: single element
    assert not has_close_elements([3], 2)
    assert not has_close_elements([3], 0.5)

    # Edge case: no elements
    assert not has_close_elements([], 1)
```
If you want to check the function's behavior for edge cases such as an empty list or a list with a single element, it's helpful to include these tests as well. This way, we can ensure that the function handles all scenarios effectively. 
The `has_close_elements` function is designed to be efficient and concise, making it suitable for production use.
