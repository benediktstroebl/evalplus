```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` uses the `zip` function to pair each element in the list with the following elements. The `any` function then checks if there is any pair for which the difference is less than the given threshold. 

To ensure that the function has access to the latest updated versions of typing modules, you may need to upgrade the `typing` library using `pip`. 

**Note**: It is worth mentioning that the `has_close_elements` function will return `False` if the list has only one element. This is due to the use of the `any` function combined with the `zip` function that pairs each list element with itself. By design, the result of `x - y` will always be zero or a negative number, which makes it false positive upon comparison with the threshold.
