Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
The `has_close_elements` function takes two arguments; a list of numbers and a threshold value. It uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if any adjacent elements in the list differ by less than the threshold. The generator expression, `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`, pairs each element with the following element. The `abs(x - y) < threshold` condition checks if the pair of elements are within the threshold of each other.  It returns `True` if any of these pairs are within the threshold and `False` otherwise.  This solution is concise and efficient for large lists as it only visits each pair of numbers once.
