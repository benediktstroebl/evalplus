Here's a Python script that contains a function called has_close_elements, which takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function works correctly and is thoroughly tested:
```python
# The following import is needed for type hinting only
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    """
    # Go through each pair of numbers in the list
    for i in range(len(numbers)-1):
        for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):
             # Calculate the distance between the current pair of numbers
             distance = abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j])
             # If the distance is smaller than the given threshold
             if distance < threshold:
                 return True
    # If none of the pairs fulfilled the condition, return False
    return False

# Following is a example usage of the function
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False

>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True

>>> has_close_elements([10.0, 11.0, 12.0], 1.0)
False
```
