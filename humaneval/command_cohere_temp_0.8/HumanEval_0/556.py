```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) <= threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This Python script defines a function called `has_close_elements`, which takes two arguments: a list of floating numbers called `numbers` and a threshold value also defined as `threshold`. 

The function ultimately answers the question of whether there are any elements in the list whose distance is less than the `threshold`. The core of this method is encapsulated in the line `any(abs(x - y) <= threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))`. Here, we use a conditional expression with a generator expression, also known as a "comprehension," to iterate through pairs of elements in the `numbers` list. 

This is achieved by using the `zip` function to pair each element in the list with its subsequent element, starting from the second. This is denoted by `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`. It's important to note that the `1:` index slice is used to skip the first element in the list, as we are assessing pairwise proximity, and we don't want to consider the largest element in the list with the smallest element in the list, for example. 

Within this comprehension, we calculate the absolute element of the difference between the elements in each pair with the `abs(x - y)` expression. This is a key operation in determining whether these elements are close, regardless of the order of magnitude of the elements. Finally, we use the `any` function, which returns `True` if any of the conditions in the comprehension are `True`. If any of the absolute differences are less than or equal to the `threshold`, the condition is `True`, and the function returns `True`. 

This indicates that the list contains elements close to each other, as per the problem statement. 

The function includes type hints, specifying that `numbers` should be a list of float values, and `threshold` should be a float value. These type hints provide strong typing, ensuring the function can dynamically enforce the expected input types when used in a program and providing clear documentation for developers who may use this function in their code. 

Overall, this Python script provides a function that solves the problem in a concise and elegant way, employing a clever use of generators and conditional expressions to efficiently tackle the problem and deliver a clear answer.
