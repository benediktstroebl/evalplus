```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) <= threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs. It uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if there exist two numbers in the list that are closer together than the threshold. The generator expression, `<generator expression>,` creates a tuple of adjacent pairs of numbers in the list `numbers` and pipes each pair to the function `zip`. The `zip` function returns a tuple of corresponding elements of two or more iterables (in this case, the list of numbers). The absolute difference between the pair of numbers is calculated using the `abs` function and compared with the threshold value. The `any` function returns True, if any of the pairs have a difference less or equal to the threshold, otherwise False. 

This approach does not require the whole list to be sorted, and performs well for large lists and small thresholds.
