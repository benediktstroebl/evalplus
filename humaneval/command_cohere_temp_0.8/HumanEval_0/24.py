Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
The function `has_close_elements` takes two arguments; a list of numbers and a threshold. It uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check for each number in the list if there is another number closer than the given threshold. The generator expression, `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`, pairs each number with the following number and the `abs` function calculates the absolute difference between the two. 

Here is an example usage of the function with the given prompt's test cases:
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```
These tests follow the given test cases from the initial markdown code block.
