Here's a Python script that contains a function called has_close_elements, which takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function works correctly and yields the appropriate output for the provided test cases.

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for i, x in enumerate(numbers) for j, y in enumerate(numbers[i + 1:], i + 1) if x < y and abs(x - y) < threshold)

# Test cases
assert not has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
```

In the `has_close_elements` function, we utilize a generator expression with nested loops to compare all possible pairs of numbers in the list. The outer loop (`enumerate(numbers)`) iterates over each number in the list, and the inner loop (`enumerate(numbers[i + 1:], i + 1)`) skips the current number and continues until the end of the list, effectively comparing each number with all the succeeding numbers. The absolute difference between each pair of numbers is computed, and the `any` function returns True if any of these differences is less than the threshold, indicating that a close pair of numbers is found.

The test cases are also provided to verify the correctness of the function. You can use these test cases to check the function's behavior against known inputs. Adjust the test cases or add more of them to ensure various scenarios are covered and the function behaves as expected.  The provided test cases are basic, and you may want to add more comprehensive tests to cover edge cases and other possible scenarios.
