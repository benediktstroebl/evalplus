```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function checks if the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list is smaller than the threshold.

To confirm the functionality, below is a simple test case:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    # True: Elements [1, 2, 3] are closer together (less than 0.1 apart)
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.1) == True

    # False: Elements [1, 2, 3] are not closer together (more than 0.1 apart)
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.2) == False

test_has_close_elements()
```

The test case validates the behavior of the function for different input scenarios. You can also add more test cases to cover a variety of scenarios and edge cases.
