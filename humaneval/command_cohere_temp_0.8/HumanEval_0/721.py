```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

To efficiently check if any close elements exist in the list, we utilize the `any` function with a generating expression using the `zip` function, which pairs each element in the list with each subsequent element. The inequality `x - y < threshold` checks if the difference between each pair of numbers is less than the provided threshold. 

This approach allows for rapid detection of close elements in the list, eliminating the need for explicit loops and reducing computational overhead.

The provided example tests demonstrate the functionality of the has_close_elements function with different input scenarios. You can incorporate these tests into your testing suite to ensure the accuracy of the function throughout your development process.
