```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` checks if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer to each other than the provided threshold. It uses a list comprehension, which is a powerful tool in Python that allows you to create a new list based on the values of an existing list after applying a specific operation/condition on each element. In this case, it checks if the difference between consecutive elements in the list is smaller than the threshold. The any function is a built-in Python function that checks if any element in a list is truthy and is used here to determine if any close elements are found in the list. 

To use this function, you can call it with a list of numbers and a threshold value and it will return a boolean indicating whether the condition is met or not. For example:
```python
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))
```
The expected output is:
```
False
True
```
