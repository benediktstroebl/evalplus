```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of floats `numbers` and a threshold `threshold` as input. It returns a boolean indicating whether any two elements in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function leverages the any function to determine if any number in the list is close (within threshold) to any other number in the list. 

To do so, it uses a generator expression, zip(numbers, numbers[1:]) which iterates over pairs of elements in the list, and subtracting the elements in each pair yields the differences.

The underlying logic stemmed from the problem is analogous to a frequent problem in interviews involving finding duplicates in a list, and it can be generalized to problems involving finding elements in a list based on some condition. 

Such problems are common for engineering roles at Google, Amazon, Facebook, and other top tech companies, so honing in on understanding and solving these kinds of problems is beneficial for unlocking various coding challenges and technical interviews.
