```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

This function takes a list of floats `numbers` and a threshold value `threshold` as input. It uses a conditional expression with the `any` function to check if any element in the list differs from its adjacent element by less than the threshold. If the condition is true for any pair of elements, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This approach uses a concise and efficient syntax to solve the problem while retaining clarity and readability.

Here is a simple test case to validate the functionality of the code:
```python
TestCase = [
		[{1.0, 2.0, 3.0}, 0.5, False],
		[{1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0}, 0.3, True]
	]

for test in TestCase:
	numbers, threshold, expected = test
	actual = has_close_elements(numbers, threshold)
	assert actual == expected
```
