```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold value as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

To efficiently check if any two elements in a list are closer to each other with a given threshold, the function `has_close_elements` uses the `any` function in combination with a generator expression. A generator expression, `x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`, is executed sequentially, and it calculates the difference between subsequent pairs of elements in the list `numbers`. If the outcome of these differences is less than the provided threshold, the `any` function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`. 

This approach ensures that the time complexity of the function is linear, proportional to the number of elements in the list, regardless of the list's size.
