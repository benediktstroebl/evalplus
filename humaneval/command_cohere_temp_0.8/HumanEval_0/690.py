```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold value as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

To efficiently check if any two elements in a list are closer together than a given threshold, the function `has_close_elements` uses the `any` function in combination with a generator expression. The generator expression `x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` iterates through all pairs of elements in the list using the `zip` function, and checks if the difference between any of these pairs is less than the provided threshold. 

The usage example provided in the function definition shows how the function works with given examples that return `False` and `True` respectively.

This approach ensures that the time complexity is proportional to the number of elements in the list, giving O(n^2) performance, while the `zip` function helps us to pairwise compare each element in the list efficiently.
