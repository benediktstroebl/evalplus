```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` checks if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer to each other than the provided threshold. It uses a list comprehension, which is a powerful construct in Python that allows you to create a new list based on the outcomes of iterations. The comprehension here iterates through pairs of adjacent elements in the list (`zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`), and checks if the difference between the pairs is smaller than the threshold. The `any()` function then determines if any of these comparisons are true. 

This approach makes the code concise and readable, allowing the handling of a variety of input scenarios efficiently. 

To better illustrate the functionality, here is a simple usage example:
```python
# Example usage
numbers = [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
threshold = 0.3

print(has_close_elements(numbers, threshold))  # Output: True
```

To further ensure the function's correctness, you can unit-test it, like so:
```python
import unittest

class TestHasCloseElements(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_close_elements(self):
        self.assertTrue(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))
    def test_not_close_elements(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))
```

This unit test will help ensure the function behaves correctly with a variety of inputs.
