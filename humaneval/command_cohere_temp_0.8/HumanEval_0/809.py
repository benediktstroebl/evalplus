```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function checks if the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list is smaller than the threshold.

To confirm that the function works as expected, let's write a test case using Python's built-in `unittest` module:
```python
import unittest

class TestHasCloseElements(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_close_elements(self):
        self.assertTrue(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))
    def test_not_close_elements(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In the test suite, the first test checks if the function returns `True` for a list of numbers where the elements are close to each other (less than `0.3` apart), and the second test checks if the function returns `False` for a list of numbers with no elements close to each other (less than `0.5` apart). 

To run the tests, you can use the `unittest` module by calling `unittest.main()` at the end of the script, and the test runner will look for any classes that inherit from `unittest.TestCase`. 

**NOTE:** The sample test code provided is just a starting point and may not cover all possible edge cases. Depending on the application, additional tests may be needed to verify the correctness of the `has_close_elements` function.
