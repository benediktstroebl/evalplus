Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
The `has_close_elements` function takes two arguments; a list of numbers `numbers` and a threshold `threshold`. It uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if any element in the list is closer to the next element than the threshold. The generator expression, `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`, pairs each element with the subsequent element in the list (skipping the last element). The `abs` function then checks if the difference between the pairs exceeds the threshold. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True
```
This example mirrors the usage provided in the problem statement. 

The function is robust and efficiently checks for close elements in the list with a given threshold. 
It does not rely on any external libraries and is scalable for large lists and thresholds. 
However, users can optimize memory usage by avoiding infinite generation of numbers in the list and adapting the approach using the `close_elements` function, as follows: 
```python
def close_elements(ns:List[float], th:float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x-y) < th for i, x in enumerate(ns) for y in ns[i+1:])
``` 
This version safely iterates through the list `ns` only once and checks against subsequent elements. Faster than the `any` approach, but still O(n^2) due to nested iteration. 
Feel free to choose the one that fits your specific use case and requirements.
