```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```
This function `has_close_elements()` works by checking if there's any pair of elements in the list where the difference between them is less than the given threshold. It uses a list comprehension, coupled with the `any` function to check if any of these conditions are met. 

To further validate the correctness of the function, two examples are provided below as tests:
```python
def test_has_close_elements():
    # Example 1: Should return False
    assert not has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    # Example 2: Should return True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
```
The first example will return `False` because none of the differences between adjacent elements are less than 0.5. The second example will return `True` because the difference between `2.0` and `2.8` is `-0.8`, which is less than the threshold of `0.3`.  This would fulfill the condition set by the problem statement.  This function and the corresponding tests should solve the problem correctly.
