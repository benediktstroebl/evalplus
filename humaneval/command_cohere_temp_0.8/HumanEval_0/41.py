```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` uses the `any` function to check if there are any elements in the list that are closer than the given threshold. The `zip` function is used to iterate over pairs of elements in the list, and the `x - y < threshold` condition checks if the difference between two consecutive elements is less than the threshold.

To use this function simply import it in your Python program or Jupyter Notebook and call it using list of numbers and threshold as shown in the examples below: 

```python
# Example 1
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
threshold = 0.5
print(has_close_elements(numbers, threshold))  # Output: False

# Example 2
numbers = [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
threshold = 0.3
print(has_close_elements(numbers, threshold))  # Output: True
``` 

This way it can be used to solve the problem statement provided.
