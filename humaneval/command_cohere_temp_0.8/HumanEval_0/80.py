```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) < threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function checks if there are any two elements in the list that are close to each other by iterating over all unique couples of elements in the list and using the `zip` function to couple them. It then uses the `abs` function to compute the absolute difference between the couple of elements and the `any` function to check if at least one couple satisfies the condition that their difference is less than the provided threshold. 

To prove that the function works correctly, we can use example usage snippets provided in the original problem, thus ensuring that the behavior of the function aligns with the expected outcome.
