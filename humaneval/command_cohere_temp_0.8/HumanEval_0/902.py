```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(a - b) <= threshold for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function uses a generator expression, formulated as a list comprehension but using `yield` instead of `return`, to iterate through all pairs of elements in the list and checks if their absolute difference is less or equal to the threshold.

To test this function, you can use the following code:
```python
import unittest

class TestHasCloseElements(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_no_close_elements(self):
        self.assertFalse(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))

    def test_with_close_elements(self):
        self.assertTrue(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This tests the function on two cases: one where the list contains numbers that are further away from each other than the threshold and another where some elements are closer to each other than the threshold.
