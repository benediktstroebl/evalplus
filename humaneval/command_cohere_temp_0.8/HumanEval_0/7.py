```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(x - y < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements()` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function employs a zipper operation, `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`, to pair each number with the following number. Subsequently, a boolean expression, `x - y < threshold`, is utilized to determine whether each pair of numbers is closer to each other than the specified threshold. 

The `any()` function then ascertains if there is at least one pair of numbers in the list that fulfills this criterion. 

This approach ensures efficiency and simplicity, as it avoids the need for explicit loop counters and uses built-in functions for indirect iteration and conditional checks.
