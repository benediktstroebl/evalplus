```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The function `has_close_elements` takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function checks if the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list is smaller than the threshold.

To test this function, we can create a unit test that exercises different cases. Here is a test that can be added to a test file (e.g., `test_has_close_elements.py`) to validate the function:
```python
import pytest
from has_close_elements import has_close_elements # assuming has_close_elements is in the file with this test and imports from it

def test_has_close_elements():
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) == True

def test_has_close_elements_with_only_one_number():
    assert has_close_elements([1.0], 1.0) == False

def test_has_close_elements_with_empty_list():
    assert has_close_elements([], 1.0) == False
```

In the test file, the first test checks the function's behavior with a list of numbers and a threshold, the second test checks if the function correctly identifies that a list with only one number doesn't have close elements, and the third test verifies that the function correctly handles an empty list. 

To run these tests, you can use pytest:
```bash
pytest test_has_close_elements.py
``` 

Alternatively, you can run the individual tests by navigating to the test file in your IDE.
