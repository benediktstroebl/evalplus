```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            num **= 2
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            num **= 3
        result += num
    return result
```

The code uses a for loop to iterate through each index and integer in the list `lst`. By using the `enumerate` function, the code can access both the index `i` and the corresponding value `num` in the list. The value is squared if the index is a multiple of 3 using the expression `num **= 2`, and it is cubed if the index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3 using the expression `num **= 3`. The resulting sum is returned at the end of the function. 

This solution allows the function to process any list of integers and return the correct sum of squares and cubes as described in the problem statement. 

To ensure the correct behavior, please ensure that the Python version uses `**` for exponentiation. The latest Python version uses `**= ` for exponentiation and `^` for bitwise XOR, so it is important to check and ensure the expected behavior.
