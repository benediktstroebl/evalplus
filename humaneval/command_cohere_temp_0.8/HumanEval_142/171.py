```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            num **= 2
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            num **= 3
        result += num
    return result
```
This function traverses the list using the enumerate function to access both the index and value of each entry. It then employs conditional statements to determine whether to square or cube each integer based on its index, incorporating the index Modulo operations to determine whether the index value ends in 3 or 4. The sums of these modified or unaltered integers are accumulated using a result variable. Finally, the function returns the accumulated sum, which provides the answer to the problem. 

Here's a test drive code to test the function:
```python
def test_sum_squares():
    assert sum_squares([1, 2, 3]) == 6
    assert sum_squares([0, 0, 0]) == 0
    assert sum_squares([-1, -5, 2, -1, -5]) == -126
    assert sum_squares([10, 20, 30, 40, 50]) == 2576
    assert sum_squares([0, 0, 0, 400, 500]) == 9000
test_sum_squares()
```
This test drive code will check the function with different inputs, and the assert statements will ensure that the function's output matches the expected outcome for each input. 
The code should be executed to see the test results in the console.  The sum_squares function can efficiently handle a variety of input lists, squareding or cubing elements as necessary, and returning the overall sum.  This approach provides a straightforward solution to the problem at hand.
