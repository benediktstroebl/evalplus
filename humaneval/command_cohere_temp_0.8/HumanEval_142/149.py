```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result += num ** 2
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            result += num ** 3
    return result
```

This Python script defines a function called `sum_squares` that takes a list of integers as input. It iterates through each element in the list and squares elements when the index is a multiple of 3 and cubes elements when the index is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3. The function then returns the sum of all modified elements in the list. 

Let's break down the code:
- The `result` variable is initialized to 0, and it will be used to store the sum of the modified numbers in the list. 
- The `for` loop goes through each element in the list `num` at index `i`, as determined by the `enumerate` function, which gives both the index and value. 
- The condition `i % 3 == 0` checks if the index is divisible by 3. If so, the corresponding list element `num` is squared. 
- The condition `i % 4 == 0 && i % 3 != 0` checks if the index is divisible by 4 but not by 3. If so, the corresponding list element `num` is cubed. 
- Finally, the function returns the value of the `result` variable, which stores the sum of all the modified numbers in the list. 

Overall, this code follows the problem statement's directive to square integers for indices that are multiples of 3 and cube integers for indices that are multiples of 4 but not multiples of 3, and it returns the sum of the modified numbers. 

This code can be tested, for example, for the input `[1, 2, 3]` it will return `6`, and for the input `[2, 4, 6, 8]` it will return `120` (4 squared and 6 cubed). For the input `[2, 4, 5, 7]` it will return `177` (2 squared, 5 cubed, and 7 squared). 
If the input is an empty list `[]`, the function should return `0`. 

This code can solve the described problem and can be tested on other inputs to verify its correctness, for more rigorous testing consider using frameworks such as `pytest`.
