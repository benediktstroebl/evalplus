```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result += num ** 2
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            result += num ** 3
    return result
```

The code uses a for loop to iterate through each index `i` and corresponding list `num` value. By using the modulo operator `%`, it determines if the index is a multiple of 3 or 4. If the index is a multiple of 3, it squares the number, and if it is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3, it cubes the number. All other indexes are left unchanged. The function then returns the sum of the modified numbers.

Here is an example execution:
```python
print(sum_squares([1, 2, 3]))
```
```
