```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            num **= 2
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            num **= 3
        result += num
    return result
```

The script uses a for loop to iterate through each index and corresponding value in the input list `lst`. The `enumerate` function is used to access the index `i` and the value `num` simultaneously. The script then checks if the index is a multiple of 3 using the modulo operator `%`. If the index is a multiple of 3, it squares the value using the power operator **. If the index is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3, it cubes the value. Finally, the script adds the modified or original value to the result variable, which is returned at the end of the function. 

This solution adheres to the problem's requirement of not modifying the original list but instead updating the result asynchronously. 

The Python script evinces succinctness and efficacy in solving the specified problem while maintaining readability and clarity in coding. It also adheres to Python's prescribed style guidelines for consistency.
