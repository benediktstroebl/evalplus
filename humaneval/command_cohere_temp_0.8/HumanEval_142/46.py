```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            num = num ** 2
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            num = num ** 3
        result += num
    return result
```

The function sums over the list `lst` and modifies each integer according to the criteria described in the prompt. To square a number, it is raised to the power of 2, and to cube a number, it is raised to the power of 3. The final sum is then returned as the function output.

This code solves the problem in a straightforward way, potentially without using any extra modules, as it iterates through the list and modifies the elements directly. It also avoids mutating the original list and opts to modify the elements inline, which is safer. 

This could be optimized (although the difference would only be noticeable for large lists) by using NumPy, which has functions for directly operating on whole arrays and avoids the need to iterate over each individual element. However, since NumPy was not stipulated in the prompt, the former code is more compatible with a wider array of Python environments, particularly those with limited SciPy/Numpy support.
