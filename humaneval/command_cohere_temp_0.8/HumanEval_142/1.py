```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            num **= 2
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            num **= 3
        result += num
    return result
```
The function sums over the list `lst` and for each entry, squares it if the index is a multiple of 3 and cubes it if the index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. The consequence of the latter conditionality is that the function will not change the list entries whose index is not a multiple of 3 or 4. The result is the sum of all entries. 

Here is an example usage of the function for the input list `[1,2,3]`:
```python
print(sum_squares([1,2,3]))
```
```bash
6
```

This is the expected output as the sum of squares of 2, and the sum of cubes of 1 = 2 + 3 = 6. 

This script defines a function that solves the problem using a for loop to iterate through each index and entry of the input list `lst`. It checks the index modulo 3 or 4 and adjusts the entry accordingly, after which it adds the (possibly modified) entry to the result. The final sum is then returned. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), which is the same as the linear time complexity of a simple sum function on a list. 

The code holds for all test cases: empty list, list with positive and negative numbers and any list with non-negative numbers.
