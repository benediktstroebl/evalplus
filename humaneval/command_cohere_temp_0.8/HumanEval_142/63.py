```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result += num ** 2
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            result += num ** 3
    return result
```

The function sums over the list `lst` and for each entry, it squares the entry if its index is a multiple of 3 and cubes the entry if 
its index is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3. The result is then returned.

To test out the function, you can use the following examples:
```python
print(sum_squares([1,2,3])) # 6
print(sum_squares([])) # 0
print(sum_squares([-1,-5,2,-1,-5])) # -126
```

All three tests should pass and print out the desired output.
