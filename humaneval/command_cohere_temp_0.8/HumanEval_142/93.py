```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            num **= 2
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            num **= 3
        result += num
    return result
```

The code uses a for loop to iterate through each index and number in the provided list. By using the `enumerate` function, the code can access both the index `i` and the value `num` in the list. 

If the index is a multiple of 3, the number is squared. If the index is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3, the number is cubed. The sum of all numbers is then returned at the end. 

This approach ensures the numbers in the list are modified only if their index meets the requirements, and the final sum is calculated correctly. 

To ensure the accuracy of the `sum_squares` function, it is recommended to include unit tests that cover different cases, such as empty lists, lists with positive and negative numbers, and lists with existing and absent cube/square numbers.
