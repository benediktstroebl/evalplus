```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result += num ** 2
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            result += num ** 3
    return result
```

The code uses a for loop to iterate through each index `i` and corresponding list `num` in `lst`. The condition `i % 3 == 0` checks if the index is a multiple of 3, in which case it squares the `num`. The condition `i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0` checks if the index is both a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3, in which case it cubes the `num`. The sum of these modified numbers is then returned as the result.

Here is a test suite that can be used to validate the functionality of this code:
```python
def test_sum_squares_with_list_1():
    input_lst = [1, 2, 3]
    expected_output = 6
    actual_output = sum_squares(input_lst)
    assert actual_output == expected_output

def test_sum_squares_with_list_2():
    input_lst = []
    expected_output = 0
    actual_output = sum_squares(input_lst)
    assert actual_output == expected_output

def test_sum_squares_with_list_3():
    input_lst = [-1, -5, 2, -1, -5]
    expected_output = -126
    actual_output = sum_squares(input_lst)
    assert actual_output == expected_output

test_sum_squares_with_list_1()
test_sum_squares_with_list_2()
test_sum_squares_with_list_3()
```

This test suite contains three individual test functions that can be executed sequentially to validate the correctness of the `sum_squares` function with different inputs.
