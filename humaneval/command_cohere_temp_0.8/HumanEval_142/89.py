```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result += num ** 2
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            result += num ** 3
    return result
```

This script defines a function called `sum_squares` that takes a list called `lst` as input. It iterates through each element in the list using the `enumerate` function, which also gives the index of each element. It then uses conditional statements to square an element if its index is a multiple of 3 and cube an element if its index is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3. It accumulates the result of these operations and returns the sum when finished.

To ensure the functionality of the code, it is recommended to test the script with different examples. Here is an example of how to do so:
```python
test_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]]

for test_list in test_lists:
    assert sum_squares(test_list) == 6
```

The test lists are valid inputs to check the functionality of the `sum_squares` function. The `assert` statement compares the result of the function with the expected output and ensures that the given input lists will return the expected output of 6. 

This should ensure the functionality of the code. Let me know if you would like me to make any changes or provide additional assistance.
