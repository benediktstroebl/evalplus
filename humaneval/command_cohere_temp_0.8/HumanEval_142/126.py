```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result += num ** 2
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            result += num ** 3
    return result
```

The code uses a for loop to iterate through each index and value in the input list `lst`. By using the `enumerate` function, the loop provides both the index (`i`) and value (`num`) of each list element.

If the index of the element is a multiple of 3, the element is squared and the squared value is added to the `result` variable. If the index of the element is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3 (i.e., `i % 3` equals `0b1`), the element is cubed and the cubed value is added to the `result` variable.

The final value of `result` is returned, which is the sum of the modified elements in the list.
