```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            num **= 2
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            num **= 3
        result += num
    return result
```

This Python script defines a function called `sum_squares` that takes a list of integers as input. It iterates through each element in the list and modifies them based on their index using the `enumerate` function, which both iterates through the list and provides the index for each entry. If the index is a multiple of 3, it squares the number; if the index is a multiple of 4 but not 3, it cubes the number. The function doesn't modify the numbers if their index isn't a multiple of either 3 or 4. It sums up all the modified numbers and returns the result.

The behavior is demonstrated by the `sum_squares` function with the provided examples in the PROBLEM statement:
1. For `lst = [1, 2, 3]`, the output should be 6. The squares of integers are 2, 4, and 9, which sum up to 6. 
2. For `lst = []`, the output should be 0 as there are no integers to modify, and hence the sum is 0. 
3. For `lst = [-1, -5, 2, -1, -5]`, the output should be -126. The squares of -1 and -5 are 1 and 25, respectively, and the cube of 2 is 8. The sum of (1, 8, 25, 1, and 25) is -126. 
These examples test the correctness of the `sum_squares` function.
