```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            num **= 2
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            num **= 3
        result += num
    return result
```
This function traverses the list using the enumerate function to access both the index and value of each list element. Based on the index modulus operations are performed on the list element and the result is accumulated. The mechanism to handle the indices multiple of both 3 and 4 correctly is the key to solving this problem. 

Here's an enhanced version with added tests to ensure the function's correctness: 
```python
import unittest

def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            num **= 2
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            num **= 3
        result += num
    return result

class TestSumSquares(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_single_int(self):
        self.assertEqual(sum_squares([1]), 1)

    def test_multiple_int(self):
        self.assertEqual(sum_squares([1, 2, 3]), 6)

    def test_empty_list(self):
        self.assertEqual(sum_squares([]), 0)

    def test_negative_int(self):
        self.assertEqual(sum_squares([-1, -5, 2, -1, -5]), -126)

    def test_mix_positive_negative(self):
        self.assertEqual(sum_squares([1, -5, 2, -1, -5, 4, -6, 1, -2]), -128)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
In this version, the `test_sum_squares` method has been added to the `TestSumSquares` class. This method calls the `sum_squares` function with a list of input values and compares the actual result with the expected output using the `self.assertEqual` method. The `unittest.main()` function is required to discover and run the tests. 

To run the test suite, copy and paste the code into a Python file and execute the file. 

To assess the functionality of the function, it is recommended to take into consideration incorporating extra test cases to cover multiple scenarios.
