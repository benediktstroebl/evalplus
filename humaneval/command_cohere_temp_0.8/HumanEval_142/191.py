```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            num **= 2
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            num **= 3
        result += num
    return result
```

The code uses a for loop to iterate through each index and entry in the provided list. By using the `enumerate` function, the code automatically has access to the index of each entry during the process, which is necessary to fulfill the requirements of the problem. Depending on the index, the corresponding entry is squared or cubed. Lastly, the function adds up all entries of the modified list and returns the result. 

The following import statement at the beginning of the code is irrelevant to the problem but might be necessary if this function exists in a larger context:
```python
from tests.sum_squares_test_case import sum_squares_test_case 
```

This way, the function can be tested with the help of the `unittest` framework, but this extension is not needed for understanding or executing the code of the `sum_squares` function itself. 

Let me know if I have misunderstood the problem or the tests and I will be happy to adjust my response!
