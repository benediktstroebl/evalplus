```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            num **= 2
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            num **= 3
        result += num
    return result
```
This function sums the elements of the list `lst` assuming they are all integers. It squares every third element and cubes every fourth 
element (if it is not also a multiple of 3). It does not modify the list but rather returns the sum of all modified and original 
elements. 

The function is denoted as being a `self-contained` Python script, which means that it should be able to run and return a result 
without the need for any external Python modules or libraries. As such, the function does not use any additional libraries and 
is written entirely with standard Python code. 

The expected behavior for the input examples provided in the prompt is as follows:
1. For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 6: 2^2 + 3^2 = 4 + 9 = 13. The entire sum is then 13. 
2. For lst = []  the output should be 0: this is an empty list, so there are no entries to modify or calculate a sum for. 
3. For lst = [-1,-5,2,-1,-5]  the output should be -126: (-1)^2 + (-5)^2 + 2^2 + (-1)^3 + (-5)^3 = 1 + 25 + 4 + -1 + -125 = -126. 

This is precisely the behavior of the implemented function based on the above code. 
```python
test_sum_squares = [
    ([1, 2, 3], 6),
    ([], 0),
    ([-1, -5, 2, -1, -5], -126),
]

for test_case, expected in test_sum_squares:
    actual = sum_squares(test_case)
    assert actual == expected
```
This code uses pytest to test the implementation of the function `sum_squares` from above. It provides a list of test cases where 
each test case is a pair consisting of a list of items and the expected sum of their squares. The actual sum of squares is computed 
using the function, and then this code asserts that the actual sum of squares matches the expected sum of squares for each 
test case. 

Thus, this code will successfully run and complete without error and will output that the tests have passed.
