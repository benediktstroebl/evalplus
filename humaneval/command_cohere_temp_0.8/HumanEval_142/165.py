```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            num **= 2
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            num **= 3
        result += num
    return result
```
This Python script defines a function called `sum_squares` that takes a list called `lst` as input. Inside the function, it uses a loop to iterate through each element in the list. If the index of the element is divisible by 3, it squares the element, and if it's divisible by 4 but not by 3, it cubes the element. The function then adds up all the modified elements and returns the total sum. 

Here is an example of how you can test this function:
```python
def test_sum_squares():
    assert sum_squares([1, 2, 3]) == 6
    assert sum_squares([-1, -5, 2, -1, -5]) == -126
    assert sum_squares([0, 0, 0, 0]) == 0
    assert sum_squares([10, 20, 30, 40, 50]) == 2550
```

In the above code, the `test_sum_squares` function tests the `sum_squares` function with four different scenarios and asserts that the output of the `sum_squares` function is correct for each scenario. 

This way, the provided code will implement and test the `sum_squares` function in a self-contained manner.  Besides, if you would like to examine the code, I provided an additional explanation of the reasoning behind the code.
