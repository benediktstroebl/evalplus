```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            num **= 2
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            num **= 3
        result += num
    return result
```

The code uses a simple for loop to iterate through each integer in the list and perform the necessary operations based on the index modulus. The result is accumulated and returned accordingly.

To test this function, you can use the following markdown:
```
```python
# Test the sum_squares function
import random

def test_sum_squares():
    # Test case 1: Example as described in the problem
    input_list = [1, 2, 3]
    expected_result = 6
    result = sum_squares(input_list)
    assert result == expected_result

    # Test case 2: Empty list
    input_list = []
    expected_result = 0
    result = sum_squares(input_list)
    assert result == expected_result

    # Test case 3: Random list with negative values
    input_list = [random.randint(-5, 5) for _ in range(random.randint(3, 10))]
    expected_result = sum(num ** 2 if i % 3 == 0 else num ** 3 for i, num in enumerate(input_list))
    result = sum_squares(input_list)
    assert result == expected_result

test_sum_squares()
```
```

This code snippet provides a self-contained Python function sum_squares that squares elements at odd indices and cubes elements at even indices, excluding those that are multiples of both 3 and 4. It then returns the sum of these modified elements. The function is tested with examples and should yield the desired results for the given problem.
