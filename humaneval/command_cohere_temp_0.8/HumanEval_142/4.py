```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result += num ** 2
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            result += num ** 3
    return result
```

The code uses a for loop to iterate through each index `i` and corresponding list `num` in `lst`. The condition `i % 3 == 0` checks if the index is a multiple of 3, in which case it squares the `num`. The condition `i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0` checks if the index is both a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3, in which case it cubes the `num`. The sum of the squared and cubed numbers are accumulated in the `result` variable and returned at the end. 

To test out the function, you can run the following:
```python
test_lst = [1, 2, 3]
print(sum_squares(test_l))  # Should output 6

test_lst = []
print(sum_squares(test_lst))  # Should output 0

test_lst = [-1, -5, 2, -1, -5]
print(sum_squares(test_lst))  # Should output -126
```

This demonstrates the functionality of the `sum_squares` function, satisfying the problem statement.
