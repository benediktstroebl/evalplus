```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            num **= 2
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            num **= 3
        result += num
    return result
```

This script defines a function called `sum_squares` taking a list as an argument, which performs the described operations on the list elements and returns the desired sum. The code comprehensively addresses every condition outlined in the problem and will produce the correct output for the examples provided. 

Let's break down the code:
- The `result` variable is initialized to 0, and enforces the use of the `enumerate` function to iterate over the list, which allows us to access the index and value of each list element seamlessly.
- The `for` loop, iterates through each element in the list, for each element:
    - The `if` statement checks if the index of the element is divisible by 3. If true, the square of the element is calculated, and the result is added to the `result` variable. 
    - The `elif` statement checks if the index of the element is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 3, in which case the cube of the element is calculated, and the result is added to the `result` variable. 
- The function returns the value of the `result` variable, which is the sum of the modified elements in the list. 

This code provides a functional solution to the problem, and the output of the function matches the examples provided in the request. Feel free to test the function with different input lists to verify its behavior accordingly. If you would like to test this function with different inputs and sanitize the input to ensure it is a list for flexibility, add the following: 

```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if not isinstance(num, int):
            raise TypeError("Input list must contain only integers.")
        if i % 3 == 0:
            num **= 2
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            num **= 3
        result += num
    return result
```

This code adds a validation step to ensure that every element in the input list is an integer, and if not, it raises a `TypeError`.
