```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            num **= 2
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            num **= 3
        result += num
    return result
```
The code uses a for loop to iterate through each index and entry in the input list `lst`. The `enumerate` function is used to access the index `i` and the value `num` of the list element simultaneously.

For each index, the code checks if it's a multiple of 3 using the modulo operator `%`. If the index is a multiple of 3, the corresponding list element `num` is squared (`**= 2`) before adding it to the `result` variable. If the index is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3 (i.e., `i % 4 == 0` and `i % 3 != 0`), then the list element `num` is cubed (`**= 3`).

The sum of all list elements is then returned at the end of the function. 

This code demonstrates practical usage of the modulo operator (`%`) to control list element transformations based on their indices. It showcases how to use Python's list comprehension to adapt elements based on index-specific conditions and calculates the sum of modified elements. 

Note that the code handles the edge cases outlined in the problem specification, including handling an empty list (`lst = []`) and returning 0 in such cases, as specified in the problem statement. 
This code provides a functional solution to the problem and adheres to the given criteria. Mentioned in the problem specification.  If you have additional questions or further clarification on this code, please let me know!
