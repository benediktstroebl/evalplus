```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            num **= 2
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            num **= 3
        result += num
    return result
```

This script defines a function called `sum_squares` taking a list of integers as an argument. It then iterates through each index `i` and number `num` in the list, and depending on the index's residue, it squares or cubes the corresponding number in the list, while leaving other numbers untouched. Finally, it sums all the numbers and returns the result. 

Here's an example usage of the function for clarification: 

```python
print(sum_squares([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 6
print(sum_squares([-1, -5, 2, -1, -5]))  # Output: -126
print(sum_squares([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: 30
``` 

This should produce the following output: 

```
6
-126
30
```
