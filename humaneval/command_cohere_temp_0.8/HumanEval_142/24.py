```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result += num ** 2
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            result += num ** 3
    return result
```

This Python script defines a function called `sum_squares` taking a list as an input argument and returning the sum of squares and cubes of the integers in the list based on their index, as per the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:
1. **Function Definition**: 
	```python
	def sum_squares(lst):
	    ```python
	    This line defines a function called `sum_squares` that takes one parameter, `lst`, which is the list of integers.
2. **Result Initialization**: 
	```python
		result = 0
		```
	This line initializes a variable named `result` to store the final sum of the squared and cubed integers.
3. **Loop through List**: 
	```python
		for i, num in enumerate(lst):
	```
	This loop iterates through each element in the input list `lst`. The `enumerate()` function is used to get both the index `i` and the value `num` of each element. 
4. **Index Based Operations**: 
	Within the loop, the code checks the index `i` against multiples of 3 and 4 to decide whether to square or cube the corresponding `num`: 
	-  If `i % 3` is equal to 0, it means the index is a multiple of 3, and the corresponding `num` is squared. 
		```python
	  	result += num ** 2
		``` 
	- If `i % 4` is equal to 0 but `i % 3` is not equal to 0, it means the index is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3, and the corresponding `num` is cubed. 
		```python
	  	result += num ** 3
		```
5. **Return the Result**: 
	```python
	return result
	```
	Once all elements in the list have been processed, the function returns the sum of the squared and cubed values. 

This code will output the desired result based on the input list, as described in the problem statement. It handles all the edge cases mentioned and will return 0 if the input list is empty.
