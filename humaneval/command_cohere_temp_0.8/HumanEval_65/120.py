```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    s = str(x)
    if shift > len(s):
        return s[::-1]
    return s[shift:] + s[:shift]
```

This code provides a solution to the problem statement by converting the integer `x` to a string (`s = str(x)`), then if the `shift` value is greater than the number of digits, it reverses the string (`return s[::-1]`), otherwise, it performs a circular shift on the digits, and returns the result as designed. 

The MD code block is also added for better code readability. 

**NOTE**: You can test this function by calling it with various integers (`x`) and shift values (`shift`) to validate its functionality against the given test cases.
