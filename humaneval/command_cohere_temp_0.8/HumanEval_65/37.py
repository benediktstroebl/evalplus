```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    s = str(x)
    if shift > len(s):
        return s[::-1]
    return s[shift:] + s[:shift]
```

This code provides a solution to the problem by taking an integer `x` and a shift value `shift` as inputs. It converts the integer `x` to a string `s` so that it can manipulate its digits as characters. The function first checks if the shift value is greater than the length of the string, using the len() function, returning the reversed string if so. Otherwise, it performs a circular shift of the digits, concatenating the shifted digits to the original ones to create the final string result. 

This solution is concise and straightforward, and it adheres to Python's official style guidelines.

Here are some test cases that can be used to validate the correctness of the `circular_shift` function:
```python
# Test case for basic functionality
assert circular_shift(12, 1) == "21"

# Test case for larger shift value
assert circular_shift(12, 2) == "12"

# Test case for shift greater than number of digits
assert circular_shift(123, 10) == "321"

# Test case for single digit number
assert circular_shift(5, 1) == "5"

# Test case for shift=0
assert circular_shift(123, 0) == "123"
```

These tests cover multiple scenarios, including shifts of different sizes, test cases with single-digit numbers, and ensuring the function's behavior remains correct for shifts larger than the number of digits.
