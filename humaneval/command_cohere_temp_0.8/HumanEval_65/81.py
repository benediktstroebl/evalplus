```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    """Circular shift the digits of the integer x, shift the digits right by shift
    and return the result as a string.
    If shift > number of digits, return digits reversed.
    """
    x = str(x)
    front, back = x[:shift], x[shift:]
    return f"{back}{front}" if shift < len(x) else f"{x[::-1]}"
```

The function str(x) converts the integer x to a string, allowing us to perform string manipulations. The tuple division operation splits the string into two parts: `x[:shift]` takes the first `shift` digits as the front portion, and `x[shift:]` takes the remaining digits as the back portion. The `f"{back}{front}"` constructs the result by concatenating the shifted digits, but only if the shift value is less than the total digits, thus performing the circular shift. If the shift is greater, more digits are shifted away, and the reversed version is returned with the `f"{x[::-1]}"` mechanism. 

This approach follows the problem's requirement to circularly shift the digits, and reverse them if too many shift amounts are provided.
