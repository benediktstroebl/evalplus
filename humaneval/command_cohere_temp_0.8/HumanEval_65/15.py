```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    digits = str(x)
    if len(digits) < shift:
        return digits[len(digits) % shift:] + digits[:len(digits) % shift]
    return digits[-shift:] + digits[:-shift]
```

This code provides a solution to the problem statement by preserving the integrity of the integer while shifting the digits. And in the case that the `shift` is greater than the number of digits, it reverses the digits and adds the shift offset. 

To get started with the function, you can use the following as an example: 
```python
circular_shift(12, 1) # 21
circular_shift(12, 2) # 12
```

This should return the integers '21' and '12' respectively, which are the results of shifting the digits of the integer '12' to the right by one and two places. 

Let me know if I missed anything or you'd like me to address a specific aspect of the solution further. I'm happy to elaborate if it aids your understanding.
