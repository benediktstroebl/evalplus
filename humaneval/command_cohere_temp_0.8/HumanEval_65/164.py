```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    s = str(x)
    return s[-shift:] + s[:-shift] if len(s) < shift else s[shift:] + s[:shift]
```

This code provides a solution to the problem of circularly shifting digits by taking the last shift digits from the right and placing them at the beginning, hence the operator s[-shift:] + s[:-shift]. The optional case is handled by simply taking the first shift digits from the left and placing them at the end if the length of the number is less than the shift.
