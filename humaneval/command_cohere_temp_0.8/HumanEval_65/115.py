```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    s = str(x)
    if shift > len(s):
        return s[::-1]
    return s[shift:] + s[:shift]
```
This Python script defines a function called `circular_shift`. It takes two parameters, `x` and `shift`. `x` is the integer to be shifted, and `shift` is the amount of shift to apply to the digits of `x`. 

The function converts `x` to a string (`s`) to facilitate digit manipulation. If `shift` is greater than the length of this string, indicating a request to shift by more digits than exist, it returns the reversed string, as the circular shift would wrap around the beginning of the string. 

Otherwise, it returns the `shift` digits from the end of the string appended to the `shift` digits from the beginning of the string, producing the circular shift. This approach allows the function to gracefully handle shifts larger than the number of digits, reversing the string when necessary. 

This code efficiently performs a circular shift on the digits of an integer and handles various shift quantities, including shifts larger than the number of digits.
