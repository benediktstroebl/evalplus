```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    digits = str(x)
    result = digits[shift:] + digits[:shift]
    if len(result) < len(digits):
        return result
    else:
        return result[::-1]
```

This script defines a function called `circular_shift`, which accepts an integer `x` and an integer `shift` as input. It utilizes Python's powerful str data type to manipulate strings and achieves the desired circular shift effect on the digits of `x`, shifting them to the right by `shift` positions. If the shift is greater than the number of digits, it reverses the result to align the digits correctly. This behavior is illustrated in the docstring's example tests, which show how the function behaves for various inputs.
