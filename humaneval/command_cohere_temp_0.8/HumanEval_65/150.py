```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    s = str(x)
    digit_len = len(s)
    if shift > digit_len:
        shift = digit_len
    return s[-shift:] + s[:-shift]
```

This approach ensures that the function remains self-contained without importing additional libraries, such as `string`. It shifts the digits circularly to the right, taking care of the edge case where the shift value is greater than the number of digits, and then returns the modified integer as a string. 

Here's the underlying reasoning behind the code:
- The first step is to convert the integer `x` to a string using the `str(x)` function. This is because we need to manipulate individual characters in the integer, which is easier to do with strings.
- The combined length of the leading and trailing portions of the string `(shift + digit_len)` is always equal to the original string length `len(s)`. This length consideration is crucial when performing circular shifts.
- The function shifts the digits circularly to the right, placing the `shift` number of digits from the right at the beginning of the string. The remaining digits are appended to the end.
- If the `shift` value is greater than the number of digits, it automatically shifts the maximum number of digits (i.e., `digit_len`) circularly. This ensures the code works as expected even under extreme conditions.

The tests for this function would involve passing different integers and shift values and validating that the output matches the expected behavior.
