```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    digits = str(x)
    result = digits[shift:] + digits[:shift]
    if len(result) < len(digits):
        result += result
    return result
```

This code provides a solution to the problem statement by taking an integer `x` and a shift value `shift` as input and returning the circular shifted version of `x`'s digits. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> circular_shift(12, 1)
"21"
>>> circular_shift(12, 2)
"12"
```

This function works by using string manipulation techniques to shift the digits of the number `x` circularly to the right by `shift`, and then pads the result with the beginning of the sequence if the shift amount is greater than the number of digits.
