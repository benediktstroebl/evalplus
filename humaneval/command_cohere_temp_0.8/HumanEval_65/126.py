```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    digits = str(x)
    return digits[-shift:] + digits[:-shift]
```

This function takes an integer `x` and an integer `shift` as input and utilises Python's array slicing to efficiently circularly shift the digits of `x` to the right by `shift`. The result is returned as a string.

For example, let's apply this function to the input `12` with `shift` values of `1` and `2`:
```python
>>> circular_shift(12, 1)
"21"
>>> circular_shift(12, 2)
"12"
```

The function agrees with the specification's intended behaviour as stated in the original problem.

This approach has a time complexity of O(1) since it performs direct string manipulation without any loops. It's a concise and optimised solution for the problem.
