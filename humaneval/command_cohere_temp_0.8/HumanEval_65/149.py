```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    s = str(x)
    if shift > len(s):
        return s[::-1]
    return s[shift:] + s[:shift]
```

This code provides a solution to the problem statement by converting the integer `x` to a string (`s = str(x)`), then performs a circular shift of the digits of this string, to achieve this, it takes the characters from the end of the string (`s[shift:]`) and appends them to the front of the string (`s[:shift]`), this represents the circular shift, then returns the result as a string. Additionally, it handles the case when the shift is greater than the number of digits, in which case it reverses the digits and returns them as a string. 

The unit tests for this function can be added as follows:
```python
# tests
def test_circular_shift():
    assert circular_shift(12, 1) == "21"
    assert circular_shift(12, 2) == "12"
    assert circular_shift(15, 3) == "915"
    assert circular_shift(527, -1) == "752"
    assert circular_shift(527, 5) == "752"

test_circular_shift()
```

This sets up a test suite with multiple test cases to validate the functionality of the `circular_shift()` function and ensures that it conforms to the expected behavior outlined in the problem statement.
