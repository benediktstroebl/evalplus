```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    s = str(x)
    if shift > len(s):
        return s[::-1]
    return s[shift:] + s[:shift]
```

This code provides a solution to the problem statement by converting the integer `x` to a string (`s = str(x)`), then if the `shift` value is greater than the number of digits, it reverses the string (`return s[::-1]`), otherwise, it circularly shifts the string placing the ending at the beginning and the beginning at the end (`return s[shift:] + s[:shift]`). 

Such a logic solves the problem statement and handles the test cases provided in the example. 

The code could be improved, however, by including some input validation for the arguments, such as checking whether `x` is a valid integer. Additionally, it could potentially benefit from more descriptive variable names, error handling for edge cases, and commenting for readability.
