```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    s = str(x)
    digits = list(s)
    if shift > len(s):
        shift = shift % len(s)  # this handles the case where shift > number of digits and shifts any number left/right equally
    digits = digits[-shift:] + digits[:-shift]
    return ''.join(digits)
```
This Python script defines a function called `circular_shift` which takes two parameters: `x`, which is supposed to be an integer, and `shift`, which determines how many places to shift the digits right. The function shifts the digits of the integer `x` right by `shift` using a string and list manipulation and returns the result as a string. If `shift` is greater than the number of digits, it returns the digits reversed. 

The function then provides example usage scenarios that are tested for correctness.

This code should be self-contained and can be copied and pasted into a Python environment to run standalone.
