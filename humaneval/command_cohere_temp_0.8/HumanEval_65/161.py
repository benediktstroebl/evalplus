```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    s = str(x)
    digits = list(s)
    if shift > len(s):
        shift = shift % len(s)
    digits = digits[-shift:] + digits[:-shift]
    return "".join(digits)
```

This code provides a solution to the problem by first converting the integer `x` to a string (`s`) and then converting this string to a list of digits (`digits`). It then performs a circular shift on this list of digits, shifting the digits to the right by `shift` positions. If `shift` is greater than the length of the integer's digit representation, it adjusts the shift so that it instead operates on the entire length of the integer. This circular shift is performed by concatenating the `shift` digits from the end of the list with the `shift` digits from the beginning of the list. The result is then joined back into a string and returned.

This code will shift the digits of the integer `x` to the right by `shift` positions, with any overhanging shift amounts wrapping around to the other end of the integer's digit representation.
