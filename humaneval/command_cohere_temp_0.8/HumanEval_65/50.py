```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    digits = str(x)
    result = digits[shift:] + digits[:shift]
    if len(result) > len(digits):
        result = result[::-1]
    return result
```

This script defines a function called `circular_shift`, which takes two parameters: `x`, which is an integer, and `shift`, which is an integer indicating how many places to shift the digits right. The function constructs a string called `digits` containing the base-10 digits of the integer `x`, and a variable called `result` which is the result of circularly shifting `digits` to the right by `shift` positions. In this shift operation, the ends of the string are joined and the new result is assigned to the variable `result`. The function then checks if the length of `result` is greater than the length of `digits`, and if so, returns the result reversed. 

The expected behavior of the function is defined using inline tests:
```python
 >>> circular_shift(12, 1)
"21"
 >>> circular_shift(12, 2)
"12"
```

These tests demonstrate the correct operation of the function.
