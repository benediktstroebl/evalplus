```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    s = str(x)
    digits = list(s)
    if shift > len(s):
        shift = len(s)
    digits = digits[-shift:] + digits[:-shift]
    return ''.join(digits)
```

This code provides a solution to the problem statement by taking an integer `x` and a shift value `s` as input and returning the circular shifted version of `x` as a string, considering the requirements of the shift value being less than or equal to the number of digits, with the shift to the right. Test cases are not provided in the original problem statement, but this code will work for any valid inputs for `x` and `shift` according to the problem statement. You can test it with the provided examples in the original problem statement:
```python
>>> circular_shift(12, 1)
'21'
>>> circular_shift(12, 2)
'12'
```
