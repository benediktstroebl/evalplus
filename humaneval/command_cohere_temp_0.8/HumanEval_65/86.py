```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    s = str(x)
    if shift > len(s):
        return s[::-1]
    return s[shift:] + s[:shift]
```

This Python script provides a function called `circular_shift`, which accepts an integer `x` and an integer `shift` as its inputs. It manipulates the digits of `x` by shifting them to the right by `shift`, adopting a circular approach that wraps around the string's start. If a shift larger than the number of digits is provided, it reverses the digits instead. This function outputs a string representing the shifted or reversed digits.

Here is an example of how to use the circular_shift function:
```python
result = circular_shift(12, 1)
print(result)  # Output: "21"
```

Below is another example:
```python
result = circular_shift(12, 2)
print(result)  # Output: "12"
``` 

Additionally, here is an example that demonstrates a scenario where the shift value is larger than the number of digits:
```python
result = circular_shift(12, 4)
print(result)  # Output: "21"
``` 

The `circular_shift` function is adaptable and can be employed to produce various results based on the given input values of `x` and `shift`.
