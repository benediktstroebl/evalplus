```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    s = str(x)
    digit_count = len(s)
    if shift > digit_count:
        shift = digit_count
    return s[shift:] + s[:shift]
```

This code provides a solution to the problem by shifting the digits of the string representation of **x** to the right by **shift**. In addition, if the shift is greater than the number of digits, it reverses the digits. The function returns the shifted result as a string.
