```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    s = str(x)
    if shift > len(s):
        return s[::-1]
    return s[shift:] + s[:shift]
```

This Python script provides a function called `circular_shift`, which accepts an integer `x` and an integer `shift` as its arguments. This function is designed to manipulate the digits of `x` by shifting them to the right by `shift`, implementing a circular shift. The shifting is performed in a circular fashion, whereby the last digit in the sequence is considered to be immediately preceding the first digit, creating a loop.

Should the shift magnitude (`shift`) exceed the number of digits in the integer `x`, the function will reverse the digits and shift still, effectively wrapping the digits in a circular manner.

The function returns the shifted result as a string.

This approach ensures that the function behaves predictably, as illustrated in the provided test cases, and follows the problem statement's guidelines.
