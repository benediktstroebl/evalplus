```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    s = str(x)
    if shift > len(s):
        return s[::-1]
    return s[shift:] + s[:shift]
```

This code provides a solution to the problem by shifting the digits of the string representation of `x` circularly to the right by `shift` and then returning the result. The code checks if the shift is larger than the length of the number and reverses the digits if it is. Otherwise, it concatenates the shifted digits with the non-shifted to achieve the desired circular shift.
