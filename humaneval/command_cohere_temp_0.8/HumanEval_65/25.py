```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    s = str(x)
    if shift > len(s):
        return s[::-1]
    return s[shift:] + s[:shift]
```
This Python script defines a function called `circular_shift` taking in two parameters, `x` and `shift`. This function operates on the concept of circular digit shifting. When the shift amount is larger than the length of the number, it performs a reverse transformation on the digits and returns the reversed string. Otherwise, it shifts the digits circularly, where the digits at the shift position are moved to the beginning, and the digits before the shift position are moved to the end. This circular shifting operation is efficiently performed through string concatenation and subtraction, as demonstrated in the provided example tests.
