```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    s = str(x)
    if shift > len(s):
        return s[::-1]
    return s[shift:] + s[:shift]
```
This Python script defines a function called `circular_shift` which takes two parameters, `x` and `shift`. This function manipulates the string representation of the integer `x` by performing a circular right shift on its digits, as specified by the shift parameter. If the shift value is greater than the number of digits in `x`, it reverses the digit string instead. The function then returns the modified string representation of the integer. 

To demonstrate this function, the docstring includes concise example use cases that are executable as code snippets, showcasing the behavior of the function for different shift values. These examples assert that the function produces the expected output for various inputs, providing clarity and assurance of its functionality.
