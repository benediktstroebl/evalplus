```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    digits = str(x)
    result = digits[shift:] + digits[:shift]
    if len(result) < len(digits):
        return result
    else:
        return result[::-1]
```

This script defines a function called `circular_shift`, which takes two parameters: `x`, which is an integer, and `shift`, which is an integer indicating how many places to shift the digits right. The function constructs a string called `digits` containing the digits of the integer `x`. Then, it performs a circular shift on these digits: it concatenates the shifted digits (taken from the end of the string) with the non-shifted digits (taken from the beginning of the string). Additionally, if the length of the shifted digits and non-shifted digits is less than the length of the `digits` string, it means there are additional digits after the shift point. In this case, the function returns the result as it is, without reversing. Otherwise, if there are no additional digits after the shift point, the function reverses the result to ensure circular shifting. 

The function is designed to handle any positive integer and shift value, and its behavior is defined according to the given test cases: it shifts the digits right by `shift` and returns the result as a string.
