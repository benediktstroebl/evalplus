```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    s = str(x)
    digits = list(s)
    if shift > len(s):
        shift = shift % len(s) 
    digits = digits[shift:] + digits[:shift]
    return ''.join(digits)
```

The function takes an integer `x` and a shift value as parameters and shifts the digits of the integer `x` circularly. It first converts the integer `x` to a string using `str(x)`. It then splits the string into a list of individual digits using `list(s)`. 

If the shift value is greater than the number of digits, it determines the effective shift by taking the remainder of the shift divided by the number of digits using the `%` operator. 

Finally, it performs the circular shift by concatenating the digits from the end of the list to the front and returns the shifted string. 

The function is self-contained and does not rely on any external variables or assumptions. 

It can be called and tested with the provided test cases directly within the markdown code block.
