```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    s = str(x)
    digit_count = len(s)
    if shift > digit_count:
        return s[::-1]
    return s[-shift:] + s[:-shift]
```

This approach shifts the digits right by `shift` and, if `shift` is greater than the number of digits, returns the digits reversed. It achieves this by converting the integer `x` to a string (`s = str(x)`), determining the count of digits (`digit_count = len(s)`), and then using string slicing and concatenation to implement the circular shift effect. 

To better understand this approach, let's break down the key steps from the provided code:
1. **Convert Input to String**: The function converts the integer `x` to a string by using `s = str(x)`. This conversion allows us to easily manipulate individual digits using string-handling techniques.
2. **Calculate Digit Count**: The length of the string `s` is then determined, providing the count of digits through `digit_count = len(s)`. This count is essential for determining the amount of shift and whether the shift exceeds the digit count.
3. **Implement Circular Shift**: The function utilizes string slicing and concatenation to achieve the circular shift. If the shift is not greater than the digit count, it constructs the shifted string by using `s[-shift:] + s[:-shift]`. The [-shift:] portion extracts the last shift digits from the string, and the `s[:-shift]` extracts the corresponding unshifted digits. Finally, the reversed string is returned if the shift is greater than the digit count, achieved using `s[::-1]`. 

This approach provides a clear and concise solution to the problem, ensuring that the shifted digits are correctly aligned in a circular manner, and accommodating cases where the shift exceeds the number of digits. 

The code includes a docstring that provides a clear explanation of the problem and the expected behavior of the function. The docstring also includes helpful test cases that demonstrate the function's behavior for various inputs. These test cases can easily be adapted and expanded upon to thoroughly validate the function's correctness in a variety of scenarios.
