```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    s = str(x)
    if shift > len(s):
        return s[::-1]
    return s[shift:] + s[:shift]
```

This code provides a solution to the problem statement by converting the integer `x` to a string (`s = str(x)`), then performing a circular shift of the digits of this string, specifically moving the digits to the right by `shift` positions, and then returning the shifted digit sequence. If the `shift` value is greater than the number of digits in the string, it reverses the string instead. This approach ensures the integrity of the digits and aligns with the problem's requirements.
