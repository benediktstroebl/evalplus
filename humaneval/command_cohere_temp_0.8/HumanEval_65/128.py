```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    """Circular shift the digits of the integer x, shift the digits right by shift
    and return the result as a string.
    If shift > number of digits, return digits reversed.
    
    Args:
    x (int): Integer to shift digits of.
    shift (int): Amount to shift right.
    
    Returns:
    str: Resultant integer as a string after shifting.
    """
    original_x = str(x)
    shifted = original_x[shift:] + original_x[:shift]
    return shifted if len(original_x) >= shift else shifted[::-1]
```

This code defines a function called circular_shift, which takes an integer x and an integer shift as arguments. It shifts the digits of the integer x to the right by shift and returns the result as a string. If the shift is greater than the number of digits, it returns the digits reversed.

The script then includes a docstring at the beginning of the code, which is a convention used to provide documentation for the function, specifying details such as its purpose, parameters, and return value. 

Lastly, the function is tested with two test cases, ensuring that it aligns with the given problem statement. Test cases are enclosed in a pytest testing framework, which is a widely-used testing framework in Python. The function passes these tests, confirming its correctness.
