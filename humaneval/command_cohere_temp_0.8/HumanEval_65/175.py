```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    digits = str(x)
    result = digits[shift:] + digits[:shift]
    if len(result) > len(digits):
        result = result[::-1]
    return result
```

This approach converts the input `x` to a string, performs the circular shift operation as described in the problem statement, and then reverses the result if it's longer than the original number of digits. This ensures that the function handles shifts beyond the number of digits correctly, as per the problem statement requirements.
