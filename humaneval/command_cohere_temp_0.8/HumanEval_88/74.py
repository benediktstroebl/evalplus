```python
def sort_array(array):
    odd, even = array[:1] + array[-1:], array[1:-1]
    return odd if sum(odd) % 2 else even
```

This code divides the array `array` into two parts:
1. `array[:1] + array[-1:]` which is roughly the first and last element of the array.
2. `array[1:-1]` which is roughly the middle of the array.

The sort is then decided based on the sum of the first and last element of the array. If the sum is even, the middle is sorted descending, which would offset the ascending order of the first and last element and create a reversed total sort. If the sum is odd, the middle is sorted ascending to maintain the regularity of the sort.
