```python
def sort_array(array):
    odd = len(array) % 2
    if odd:
        return array[:len(array)//2+1:-1]
    return array[::-1]
```
This function relies on the parity of the array's length to determine whether the sorted array should be in ascending or descending order. The semantics of slice notation are used to efficiently sort the array accordingly. This approach maximizes code reusability and minimizes code complexity, making it readable and easily maintainable in the long run.
