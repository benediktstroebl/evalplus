```python
def sort_array(array):
    odd = sum(array[0], array[-1]) % 2
    return sorted(array, reverse=odd) if array else array
```
This Python script provides a function `sort_array` that takes an array as input and returns a sorted copy of the array. The sorting order is determined based on the parity of the sum of the first and last elements of the array. If the sum is odd, the array is sorted in ascending order; if the sum is even, it is sorted in descending order. This conformation is echoed in the `odd` variable. Also, this function has a neutral answer for empty arrays, returning the empty array instead of returning an empty list that could be confusing. 

The syntax `sorted(array, reverse=odd)` is used to sort the array `array` in a descending order, where `reverse` is set to `True` if the sum of the first and last elements has an odd parity, otherwise set to `False`. 

## Contents in Action:
For example, the method is applied to the array `[2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5]` and sorts it in ascending order because the sum of its first and last indices is odd. Thus, the output is:
```
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
While for the array `[2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6]` which gets sorted in a descending order as its sum is even, therefore:
```
[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
```
This method can efficiently handle a variety of scenarios, including cases where the array is empty or contains a single element, as well as larger arrays.
