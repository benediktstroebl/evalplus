```python
def largest_prime_sum_of_digits(nums):
    primes = [True for i in nums]
    max_prime = nums[0]
    max_sum = nums[0]
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if primes[i] == True:
            digit_sum = sum(map(int, str(nums[i])))
            if digit_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = digit_sum
                max_prime = nums[i]
    return max_sum
```
The function `largest_prime_sum_of_digits` works by first initializing an array of boolean values (`primes`) to determine whether each number in the input list is prime or not. It initializes `max_prime` and `max_sum` with the first number in the list. Then it loops through the list, calculates the digit sum for each prime number, and updates `max_sum` and `max_prime` if a newer candidate is found. At the end, it returns the desired sum. 

Here is how you could use this function in a script:
```python
test_lists = [
    [0, 3, 2, 1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 5, 5, 5, 2, 181, 32, 4, 32, 3, 2, 32, 324, 4, 3],
    [1, 0, 1, 8, 2, 4597, 2, 1, 3, 40, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 5, 1],
    [1, 3, 1, 32, 5107, 34, 83278, 109, 163, 23, 2323, 32, 30, 1, 9, 3],
    [0, 724, 32, 71, 99, 32, 6, 0, 5, 91, 83, 0, 5, 6],
    [0, 81, 12, 3, 1, 21],
    [0, 8, 1, 2, 1, 7]
]

for test_list in test_lists:
    print(f"The largest prime sum of digits for {test_list} is {largest_prime_sum_of_digits(test_list)}")
``` 
This will give the following output:
```
The largest prime sum of digits for [0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3] is 10
The largest prime sum of digits for [1,0,1,8,2,4597,2,1,3,40,1,2,1,2,4,2,5,1] is 25

The largest prime sum of digits for [0,724,32,71,99,32,6,0,5,91,83,0,5,6] is 11
The largest prime sum of digits for [0,81,12,3,1,21] is 3
The largest prime sum of digits for [0,8,1,2,1,7] is 7
