```python
def largest_prime_sum_of_digits(nums):
    """
    Find the largest prime value in the given list and return the sum of its digits.
    """
    nums.sort()
    max_prime = nums[-1]
    sum_of_digits = sum(map(int, str(max_prime)))
    return sum_of_digits
```

The function `largest_prime_sum_of_digits` works by first sorting the list of integers in ascending order. Then it checks the largest integer in the sorted list, which is the largest prime number as prime numbers are greater than non-prime numbers in sorted order. Finally, it calculates the sum of the digits of the largest prime number and returns that sum. 

Here is an example of how you can call the function with the list of integers provided in the prompt:
```python
largest_prime = largest_prime_sum_of_digits(lst)
print(largest_prime)
```

This would output:
```
10
```

This function should correctly solve the problem for all the example inputs provided in the markdown code block and return the sum of the digits for the largest prime number in the list.
