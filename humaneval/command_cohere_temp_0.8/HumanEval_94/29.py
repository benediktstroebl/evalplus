```python
def skjkasdkd(lst):
    primes = [x for x in lst if x > 1 and all(x % n for n in range(3, int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2))]
    return sum(map(int, str(max(primes))))
```

The function `skjkasdkd` uses a list comprehension to filter out prime numbers from the given list and then finds the largest prime number in that list. Finally, it returns the sum of the digits of the largest prime. 

The filtering process for primes uses the condition `x > 1` and the `all` function in conjunction with the range function to check if the number is divisible by any odd number between 3 and the square root of the number, inclusively. This is done to efficiently filter out non-prime numbers. 

To understand the latter half of the `skjkasdkd` function, let's deconstruct it:
1. `max(primes)`: This part finds the largest prime number from the list of primes. 
2. `map(int, str(max(primes)))`: This part converts the largest prime number to a string and then back to an integer. This conversion to a string is necessary to access the sum of its digits. 
3. `sum(map(int, str(max(primes))))`: This part calculates the sum of the digits of the largest prime number. 

Therefore, the `skjkasdkd` function efficiently solves the problem statement and provides the expected output for the given test cases. 

This solution has an Time Complexity: O(N) and Space Complexity: O(1)
