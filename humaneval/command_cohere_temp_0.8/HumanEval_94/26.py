```python
def skjkasdkd(lst):
    primes = [x for x in lst if x % 2 == 1 and x > 1]
    max_prime = max(primes) if primes else 0
    return sum(map(int, str(max_prime)))
```

The provided code defines a function `skjkasdkd` that takes a list of integers as input and aims to find the largest prime number in the list, then returns the sum of its digits.

The function first creates a list of prime numbers from the input list using a list comprehension. It filters elements that are odd and greater than 1, which are prime candidates. The max prime in this list is then computed. If no primes are found, the max prime is set to 0. Finally, the function converts the largest prime to a string and sums the digits to provide the final output.
