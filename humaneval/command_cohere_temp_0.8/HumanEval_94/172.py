```python
def largest_prime_sum_of_digits(nums):
    primes = [True for _ in nums]
    max_prime = nums[0]
    max_sum = nums[0]
    for n in nums:
        if primes[n]:
            if n == max_prime:
                max_sum = max(max_sum, sum(map(int, str(n))))
            elif n > max_prime:
                max_prime, max_sum = n, sum(map(int, str(n)))
    
    return max_sum
```

The function `largest_prime_sum_of_digits` works by first initializing an array of boolean values (`primes`) to determine whether each number in the input list is a prime or not. It initializes `max_prime` and `max_sum` to the first element of the list. Then, it loops through the list, checking if the current number is prime and updating `max_prime` and `max_sum` accordingly. Finally, it returns the `max_sum` value, which represents the largest prime value's sum of digits. 

To run the code, you can copy and paste it into a Python environment or script, and it will function independently. You can also modify the code to better suit your needs or preferences. 
If you want to test the function, you can call it with various input lists, such as `my_list` in the example below:
```python
my_list = [0, 3, 2, 1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 5, 5, 5, 2, 181, 32, 4, 32, 3, 2, 32, 324, 4, 3]
print(largest_prime_sum_of_digits(my_list))  # Output: 10
```
