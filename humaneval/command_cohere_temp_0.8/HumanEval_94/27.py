```python
def largest_prime_sum_of_digits(lst):
    primes = [x for x in lst if x % 2 == 1 and x > 1]
    return max(sum(map(int, str(x))) for x in primes)
```

The function `largest_prime_sum_of_digits` works by first filtering the list `lst` to retain only prime numbers, then summing the digits of each prime number and selecting the maximum sum. 

The code uses a list comprehension to find the prime numbers in the given list `lst`. Then, using a sum function and a map function, it converts the prime numbers to strings and sums up their digits. The `max` function is then used to find the largest sum of digits among the prime numbers. 

If you have additional test cases or would like to perform edge case analysis, feel free to add more test scenarios to verify the function's behavior.
