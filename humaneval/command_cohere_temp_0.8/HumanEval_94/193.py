```python
def skjkasdkd(lst):
    primes = [x for x in lst if x % 2 == 1 and x > 1]
    max_prime = max(primes) if primes else 0
    return sum(map(int, str(max_prime)))
```

The provided code defines a function `skjkasdkd` that takes a list of integers as input and aims to find the largest prime number in the list, then returns the sum of its digits.

The function first creates a list of prime numbers from the input list using a list comprehension. It then finds the largest prime in this list using the `max` function, but first checks if there are any primes in the list, so that max operates on an empty list as `max( []) `, returns 0 in such a case. Finally, it converts the largest prime to a string and sums the digits using the `sum` and `map` functions to perform the digit summation.
