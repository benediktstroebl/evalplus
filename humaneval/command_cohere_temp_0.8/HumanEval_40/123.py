```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst):
    # Using Counter to count the number of items with certain values
    ct = Counter(lst)
    # filtering for values with counts divisible by 3
    for num, count in ct.items():
        if count % 3 == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The solution uses a counter to count the number of items in the list (`lst`) that have certain values. If there are three items with the same value, their count will be divisible by three (`count % 3 == 0`). If there are two items with the same value, the sum of those two items will sum to zero with the third item. This solution runs through the list once, making it efficient. It returns `True` if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is a version of the code with more explicit comments and a link to the code on Github:
```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst):
    # Initialize a counter to count the number of items in the list with certain values
    counter = Counter(lst)
    # Check if there are any values with a count divisible by three
    for num, count in counter.items():
        if count % 3 == 0:
            return True
    return False
