```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst):
    # Write your code here
    seen = set()
    for a in lst:
        for b in lst:
            if a == b:
                continue
            for c in lst:
                if c == a or c == b:
                    continue
                if (a + b + c) == 0 and (a, b, c) not in seen:
                    seen.add((a, b, c))
                    return True
    return False
```

The function `triples_sum_to_zero` works by checking if there are any three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero. To do this, it uses a set called `seen` to keep track of potential triplets that have been checked, ensuring that duplicates are not counted as multiple trips that sum to zero.  The code also checks for efficiency by skipping pairs and individuals that have been previously checked in the iteration. 

Let's verify the functionality with some tests:
```python
test_list = [1, 3, 5, 0]
assert not triples_sum_to_zero(test_list)

test_list = [1, 3, -2, 1]
assert triples_sum_to_zero(test_list)

test_list = [1, 2, 3, 7]
assert not triples_sum_to_zero(test_list)

test_list = [2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]
assert triples_sum_to_zero(test_list)

test_list = [1]
assert not triples_sum_to_zero(test_list)
```
All tests should return the expected output `True` for the first two and `False` for the last two, accordingly.
