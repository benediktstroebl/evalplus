```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    seen = set()
    for a in l:
        if a == 0:
            continue
        for b in l:
            if a + b in seen:
                continue
            for c in l:
                if a + b + c == 0 and a != b != c:
                    return True
        seen.add(a)
    return False
```

The function `triples_sum_to_zero` works by checking if any three distinct elements in the list sum to zero. The function iterates through the list, and for each element, it checks if the element is zero, it skips this element and moves to the next element in the list. If the element is not zero, it starts a nested loop, where it iterates through the other elements in the list to find another element that, along with the current element, sums up to zero. Once we find the element that satisfies these conditions, the function returns True since we have found a triplet that sums up to zero. The nested loop continues until it checks all possible pairs in the list for each element, if no such triplet is found for any element in the list, the function returns False. 

This approach ensures that each element is considered in combination with every other element in the list (except for the zeroes, which are skipped, as determining a triplet that sums to zero including a zero is trivial). 

The test cases provided in the problem statement are covered in the unit tests included in the code snippet below:
```python
def test_triples_sum_to_zero():
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]) == False
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]) == True
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]) == False
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]) == True
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1]) == False
