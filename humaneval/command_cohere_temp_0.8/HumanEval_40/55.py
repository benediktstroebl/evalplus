```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    seen = set()
    for a in l:
        if a == 0:
            continue
        for b in l:
            if a + b in seen:
                continue
            for c in l:
                if a + b + c == 0 and a != b and a != c and b != c:
                    return True
                if a + b + c == 0:
                    seen.add(a + b)
    return False
```

The function goes through each number in the list l. For each number a, it then looks for another number b such that a + b is not in the seen set, which avoids counting the same (a, b, c) triple multiple times when c varies. If such a b is found, it then looks for c such that a + b + c == 0, and returns True. The seen set is used to avoid counting (a, b, c) triples more than once. If no such c is found, it adds a + b to the seen set to avoid counting the (a, b, c) triple in which c equals a + b (since that would make the sum zero). It is important to skip zeros in the list since any three items adding up to zero will not have a zero in it. 

Here is a test suite that can be used with the above function to verify it:
```python
def test_triples_sum_to_zero():
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]) == False
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]) == True
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]) == False
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]) == True
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1]) == False
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) == False
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([-3, -3, -1, -2, 0]) == True
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([-3, -3, -2, -1, 0]) == False
```

To test the function, you can call it with different lists and verify that the returned value matches the expected value for the problem.
