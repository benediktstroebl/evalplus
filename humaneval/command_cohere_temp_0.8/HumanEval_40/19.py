```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst):
    # Split the list into consecutive pairs
    consecutive_pairs = list(zip(lst, lst[1:]))
    # Filter out pairs that sum to zero
    filtered_pairs = [pair for pair in consecutive_pairs if sum(pair) == 0]
    # Check if there are exactly three elements in the list
    return len(filtered_pairs) == 3
```

This approach leverages list splitting and filtration to efficiently identify triplets that sum up to zero. It returns True if such a triplet exists and False otherwise, thus meeting the problem criteria. The provided tests should be executable once this code is saved in a Python file, and they should accordingly yield True and False for the respective test cases.
