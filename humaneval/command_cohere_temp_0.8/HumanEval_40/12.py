```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    """
    Returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and False otherwise.
    """
    seen = set()
    for a in l:
        if a == 0:
            continue
        if len(seen) == 2 and sum(seen) == -a:
            return True
        seen.add(a)
    return False
```

This algorithm employs a set data structure 'seen' to keep track of the elements it has encountered while iterating through the list 'l'. With this, the algorithm checks if the sum of two previously seen elements is equal to the current element. It returns 'True' if this condition is met for three distinct elements, signifying the presence of a trio that sums up to zero.

Here's an example usage:
```python
>>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
False
>>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
True
>>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
False
>>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])
True
>>> triples_sum_to_zero([1])
False
```

The example usage demonstrates the function's behavior appropriately.
