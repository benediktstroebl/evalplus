```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst):
    # Define the variable to store whether a triplet is found
    found = False

    # Iterate over the list and check for a triplet whose sum is zero
    for a in lst:
        for b in lst:
            if a != b and sum([a, b, lst[0]]) == 0:
                found = True
                break

        # If a triplet is found, break out of the inner loop
        if found:
            break

    return found
```

This function originates from the problem statement, which poses the task of determining whether a given list encompasses three distinct elements that sum to zero. To identify such a triplet, we iterate through the list, considering all pairs of elements. For each pair, we ascertain whether the remainder of the elements could sum to zero. If we find a viable triplet, we exit the nested loop and set the 'found' flag to True. Ultimately, the function returns this flag, which indicates whether our search was successful. 

Here is a simple test suite to ensure that the function behaves as expected:
```python
def test_true():
    # Example [1, 3, -2, 1]
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]) == True

def test_false():
    # Example [1, 2, 3, 7]
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]) == False

test_true()
test_false()
```
These tests check if the function correctly identifies if a list has three distinct elements that sum up to zero. 

 (**Note**: It is worth mentioning that there is an existing Python optimization technique, called tuple unpacking, that helps to make the code more efficient. This approach involves calculating the sum of the remaining elements *without* subtracting the third element, as this would lead to a negative result. This way, we can avoid redundant negative values during our calculation.)
