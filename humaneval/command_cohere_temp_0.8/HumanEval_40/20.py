```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    # Write your code here.
    seen = set()
    for a, b in itertools.combinations(l, 2):
        if a + b == 0 and (a, b) not in seen:
            seen.add((a, b))
            if len(seen) == 3:
                return True
    return False
```

This code uses `itertools.combinations` to efficiently generate all possible pairs of elements in the list. It checks if the sum of each pair is zero and adds the pair to the set `seen` only if it hasn't been seen before. Once there are three distinct elements in `seen`, indicating a qualifying triple, the function returns `True`.

This approach ensures that each combination is checked only once and avoids duplicating the effort that occurs when directly using nested loops. It results in a more efficient solution for larger lists.
