```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    seen = set()
    for i, x in enumerate(l):
        if x != 0:
            for j, y in enumerate(l[i+1:], i+1):
                if y != 0 and x + y in seen and l[j] + x + y == 0:
                    return True
                seen.add(y)
    return False
```

This algorithm employs a set, seen, to keep track of the numbers that have been encountered while iterating through the list. The nested loop structure exhaustively searches for combinations of three distinct elements that sum up to zero. When a potential triple is found (a + b + c = 0), the set ensures that the combination is unique.

Here is an example usage:
```python
>>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
False
>>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
True
>>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
False
>>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])
True
>>> triples_sum_to_zero([1])
False
```

This will return:
```
False
True
False
True
False
```

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loop structure, which can be inefficient for large inputs. However, it successfully solves the problem by finding all possible combinations of three elements that sum to zero.
