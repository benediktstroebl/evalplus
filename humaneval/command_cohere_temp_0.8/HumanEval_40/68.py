```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst):
    # Write your code here. Read the docstring of the original function for more guidance.
    return any(x + y + z == 0 for x, y, z in itertools.combinations(lst, 3))
```

This function uses a list comprehension, which attempts all possible triplets of elements from the list and checks if their sum equals zero.

To validate the functionality of this solution, you can use the following tests, which are taken from the original problem:
```python
def test_triples_sum_to_zero():
    # These tests are from the docstring of triples_sum_to_zero

    # Triplets that sum to zero
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]) == False
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]) == True

    # No triplets that sum to zero
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]) == False

    # Multiple triplets that sum to zero
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]) == True

    # Single element list
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1]) == False

test_triples_sum_to_zero()
```

This test suite will cover the functionality of your code, and any well-written replacement function should be able to pass these tests.
