The approach works by using a set `seen` to keep track of elements we have seen so far. For positive elements, we add them to the set, and for negative elements, we delete them from the set. If we encounter a positive element and there are no elements in the set, or we can remove exactly one element from the set (namely `a - 1`, `-a`, or `1`), then we have found a trio that sums up to zero. The corresponding test cases illustrate the correctness of the approach.
