```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    seen = set()
    for i in l:
        if len(seen) == 2:
            x, y = seen
            if i + x + y <= 0:
                return True
        seen.add(i)
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as input. It checks if there are three distinct elements in the list whose sum equals zero. To do this, it utilizes a set called `seen` to keep track of unique elements it has encountered while iterating through the list. Once it has found two elements, `x` and `y`, it checks if the current element (`i`) along with the previous two elements sum up to zero or less. If this condition is met, it returns `True`. If the condition isn't met, or if the list contains less than three distinct elements, it returns `False`. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
False
>>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
True
>>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
False
>>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])
True
>>> triples_sum_to_zero([1])
False
```

These examples illustrate how the function behaves for various input lists, indicating whether triples sum up to zero or not.
