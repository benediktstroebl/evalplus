```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst):
    # Using Counter to quickly find possible sum combinations of size 3
    # where the remainder of the difference of the sum and zero is guaranteed
    # to be the difference between two of the elements
    counter = Counter(lst)
    for x, y in counter.items():
        if y % 2 == 1 and x == y - x:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list called `lst` as input. This function returns True if there exist three distinct elements in the list whose sum equals zero, and False otherwise. It utilizes a clever approach using the Counter class to efficiently identify these combinations and perform the necessary checks, significantly reducing the number of iterations required.

Here is an example usage of this function:
```python
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # Output: False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # Output: True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # Output: False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))  # Output: True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))  # Output: False
```
