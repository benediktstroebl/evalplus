The algorithm works by checking each pair of elements in the list, moving forward and backward through the list, checking if the third element that completes the sum to zero exists. The checking is done using set logic, as usual, to ensure no duplicates are calculated. We are careful about the indices we check to avoid skipping elements and finally return True if a triplet is found and False if not. 
The tests passed, and we can confirm that our function works correctly. Do you need assistance with anything else?
