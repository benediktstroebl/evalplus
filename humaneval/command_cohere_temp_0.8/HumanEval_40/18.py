```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    # Write your code here.
    seen = set()
    for a, b in itertools.combinations(l, 2):
        if a + b == 0 and (a, b) not in seen:
            seen.add((a, b))
            if len(seen) == 3:
                return True
    return False
```

This code uses an itertools.combinations to iterate over all pairs of elements in the input list l. For each pair (a, b), it checks whether their sum is equal to zero. Additionally, it maintains a set seen to track the unique elements (a, b) that sum up to zero. If the seen set has exactly 3 elements, it means there are three distinct elements in the list that sum up to zero, and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loop structure, but the use of itertools.combinations helps to optimize the process of pair generation. The space complexity is O(n) due to the creation of the seen set.
