```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst):
    # Using Counter to count occurrences of elements in the list
    cnt = Counter(lst)
    # Filtering elements that can form a sum of zero with another element
    candidates = [k for k, v in cnt.items() if v >= 2 and cnt[k - lst[0]] >= 1 and cnt[k + lst[0]] >= 1]
    return len(candidates) == 3
```

The function leverages Python's `Counter` class to tally the occurrences of each number in the input list. It then identifies candidates capable of forming a sum of zero with another element by following these criteria:
1. An element appears twice or more in the list.
2. The element's difference or sum with the list's first element appears once or more.

Given these conditions, the function indicates a triplet that sums to zero when there are precisely three unique candidates. Otherwise, no such triplet exists, yielding a result of `False`.

This solution is both efficient and succinct, providing a clear pathway to understanding the problem and its resolution. I hope this helps continue the discussions about problem-solving and optimizing algorithms. Let me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like me to walk through any other coding problems or topics!
