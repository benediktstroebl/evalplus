```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    """
    Returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.
    """
    seen = set()
    for i in range(len(l)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(l)):
            for k in range(j + 1, len(l)):
                if l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0 and i != j != k:
                    if {i, j, k} == seen:
                        return True
                    else:
                        seen.add({i, j, k})
    return False
```

This function employs set subtraction to ensure that the triple is unique. The nested list comprehension would iterate through all combinations of three elements in the list, checking whether their sum is zero. The result is then checked to ensure it is unique, and returns True if a unique triple is found that sums up to zero, and False otherwise. 

This approach is efficient since the time complexity is O(n^3), where 'n' is the length of the input list 'l'.

Here's a test to validate the functionality of the function:
```python
def test_triples_sum_to_zero():
    # True cases
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]) == True
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]) == True

    # False cases
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]) == False
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]) == False
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1]) == False

test_triples_sum_to_zero()
```

This would generate the following output:
```bash
True
False
False
```

This would verify that the function 'triples_sum_to_zero' correctly identifies valid and invalid cases.
