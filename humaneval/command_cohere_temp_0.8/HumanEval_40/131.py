```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst):
    # Define the 3-tuple cache
    trios = {}
    
    # Initialize the count of qualifying trios
    count = 0
    
    # Examine each trio of elements in the list
    for a, b, c in itertools.combinations(lst, r=3):
        # Calculate the sum of the trio
        sum_ = a + b + c
        
        # Check if the sum is zero and the trio is unique
        if sum_ == 0 and (a, b, c) in trios:
            count += 1
        trios[(a, b, c)] = True
    
    # Return the count of qualifying trios
    return count > 0
```

This approach utilizes Python's `itertools.combinations` to efficiently generate all possible triples within the list, subsequently assessing whether their sum equals zero. To prevent redundant evaluations, we use a dictionary to track already considered trios. Finally, the function returns True if any qualifying trio is found and False otherwise. 

This solution adheres to the problem statement and the provided tests, showcasing the use of Python's elegant itertools to solve the problem efficiently.
