```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    """
    Returns True if three distinct elements in the list sum up to zero, False - otherwise.
    """
    seen = set()
    for i in l:
        if 0 == i:
            continue
        x, y = divmod(i, -2)
        if x in seen and y in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(x)
        seen.add(y)
    return False
```

This approach uses a generator to enumerate through all unique pairs of elements in the list. It checks if the sum of each pair is equal to `-2`, and if so, it checks if the third distinct element whose sum with the pair is equal to `0` is present in the list.

The tests could be run by copying the following code into a separate file and running it:
```python
def test_triples_sum_to_zero():
    """
    Tests for the function triples_sum_to_zero from the previous response.
    """
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]) == False
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]) == True
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]) == False
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]) == True
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1]) == False

test_triples_sum_to_zero()
```

This file will check if the function behaves as expected on the already mentioned examples and return the result accordingly.
