This Python script defines a function called `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as input. It iterates through the list, looking for pairs of elements that sum up to zero. If found, it checks if the sum of these two elements and a third distinct element in the list equals zero. If this condition is met for three distinct elements, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The script excludes zeros in the list and checks for symmetry (e.g., `(a, b) == (b, a)`). It ensures that each combination of three elements is considered only once to avoid duplicates. The code efficiently solves the problem and returns the appropriate result.
