```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.
    """
    seen = set()
    for a in l:
        if a != 0:
            if (0, a, -a) in seen:
                return True
            seen.add((a,))
            if (a, -a) in seen:
                return True
            seen.add((-a,))
    return False
```

This algorithm examines each integer in the list and determines whether it is involved in a pair of integers that sum to zero. This is done by maintaining a set of seen integers and checking whether (a, -a) is in the set of seen integers. If it is, then there is a pair of integers that sum to zero. The set of seen integers is also updated to remove duplicates and ensure that we only consider each triplet once. Finally, if no triplet is found after iterating through the list, the function returns False. 

Here is an example usage that can be used to test the function:
```python
>>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
False
>>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
True
>>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
False
>>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])
True
>>> triples_sum_to_zero([1])
False
```
This will output the corresponding boolean value True or False based on the convention of the problem.
