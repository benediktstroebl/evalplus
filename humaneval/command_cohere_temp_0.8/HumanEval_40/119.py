```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst):
    # Write your code here. Read the problem statement again before coding.
    seen = set()
    for a in lst:
        for b in lst:
            if a != b and sum(c for c in [a, b] if c in seen) == 0:
                return True
                seen.add(a)
                seen.add(b)
    return False
```

The code works by iterating through each element in the list (`lst`) twice. For each pair of elements `(a, b)`, it checks whether they add up to zero and whether they are distinct. If they do, the function returns `True`. To ensure that the code only detects each triple once, it uses a `set` to mark which elements have been seen.  This way, it avoids repeating the same triple. 

The provided code includes tests that illustrate how the function behaves for different inputs. 
```python
def test_triples_sum_to_zero():
    # Test cases from the problem statement
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]) == False
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]) == True
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]) == False
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]) == True
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1]) == False

    # Additional test cases
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, -1, 2, -5, 0, -7, 7]) == True
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, -5, 6]) == True
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([-5, -10, 15, 20]) == False
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == False
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([-5, -20, 15, 10, -5, -15, 0, 5, 10]) == True
