```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    seen = set()
    for i, x in enumerate(l):
        if x != 0:
            for j, y in enumerate(l[i+1:], i+1):
                if y != 0 and x + y in seen and l[j-1] + x + y == 0:
                    return True
                seen.add(y)
    return False
```

This algorithm employs a set, seen, to keep track of the integers encountered while iterating through the list. The outer loop iterates over each element in the list, starting at index 0. Then, the inner loop iterates over the remaining elements in the list, starting at the next index after the previous iteration.

The algorithm checks whether the current element, x, is not zero. If so, it proceeds to check whether the current element, x, plus any element in the remaining list whose sum with x is zero, exists in the seen set. If this criterion is met, and the sum of the current element, x, plus the element in the seen set equals zero, then the function returns True. The seen set is updated with the remaining elements in the list, ensuring that each integer is only marked as seen once.

If the algorithm completes without finding a qualifying triplet, it returns False. This approach helps solve the problem in a more efficient manner.
