```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst):
    # Write your code here
    seen = set()
    for a in lst:
        for b in lst:
            if a != b and a + b in seen:
                return True
            seen.add(a)
    return False
```

This function examines all possible pairs of elements in the list, tracking those that have been seen before using a set data structure. When a pair of numbers whose sum is zero is encountered, it indicates the presence of three distinct elements that sum up to zero. The function returns `True` if any such triplet is found and `False` otherwise, aligning with the problem statement's criteria. 

This approach has a time complexity of `O(n^2)`, where `n` is the length of the input list, due to the nested loop structure. 

The approach is efficient for lists of small sizes, but larger lists may benefit from more efficient algorithms to reduce computation time. If the list is too large, further optimizations or more efficient algorithms may be necessary.
