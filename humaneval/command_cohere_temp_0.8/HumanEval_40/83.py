```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst):
    # Split the list into triples
    tests = [(lst[i:i + 3]) for i in range(0, len(lst), 3)]
    
    # Check if any of the triples have a sum of zero
    return any(sum(x) == 0 for x in tests)
```

This Python script defines a function called `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes in a list of numbers (`lst`) as input. It aims to identify whether any three distinct elements within the list sum up to zero. To do this, the function first shuffles the list mentally and divides it into triples using a generator expression. It then sums each triple and checks if any of these sums equals zero. The `any` function returns `True` if any of the sums are zero, indicating the presence of three distinct elements that sum up to zero. 

Here is an example usage of this function:
```python
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # Output: False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # Output: True
```

This function is designed to efficiently solve the problem and provide the required output. It can be used as a standalone block of code to fulfill the task requirement, making it adaptable to different situations.
