```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst):
    # Write your code here
    seen = set()
    for a in lst:
        for b in lst:
            if a != b and a + b in seen:
                return True
            seen.add(a)
    return False
```

This function examines all possible pairs of elements in the list, tracking those that have been seen before using a set data structure. When a pair of numbers whose sum is zero is encountered, it indicates the presence of three distinct elements adding up to zero. The function returns True in such cases and False otherwise. 

Here is an example of an invocation for this function:
```python
>>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
False
```

And here is the corresponding test code, making use of the function:
```python
def test_triples_sum_to_zero():
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]) == False
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]) == True
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]) == False
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]) == True
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1]) == False
```
