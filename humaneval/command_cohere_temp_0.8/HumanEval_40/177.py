```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    # Write your code here.
    seen = set()
    for a, b in itertools.combinations(l, 2):
        if a + b == 0 and (a, b) not in seen:
            seen.add((a, b))
            if len(seen) == 3:
                return True
    return False
```

This code uses `itertools.combinations` to efficiently generate all possible pairs of elements in the list. It checks if their sum is zero and the pair has not been seen before. Once three distinct pairs are found, the function returns `True`.
