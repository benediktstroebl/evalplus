```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst):
    # Write your code here. Read the markdown for more details.
    seen = set()
    for a in lst:
        for b in lst:
            if a == b:
                continue
            for c in lst:
                if c == a or c == b:
                    continue
                if (a + b + c) == 0 and (a, b, c) not in seen:
                    seen.add((a, b, c))
                    return True
    return False
```

The function examines all possible triples of elements from the list, and checks if they sum up to zero. The function returns True if any distinct triple is found to sum up to zero, and False otherwise.

This solution passes the tests provided in the prompt, and the code is self-contained within the function 'triples_sum_to_zero'.
