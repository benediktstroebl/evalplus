    seen = set()
    for i in range(len(l)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(l)):
            for k in range(j + 1, len(l)):
                if l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0 and i != j != k:
                    if {i, j, k} == seen:
                        return True
                    else:
                        seen.add({i, j, k})
    return False
```

This algorithm uses three nested loops to iterate through all possible triples of distinct elements of the input list `l`. The sum of these three elements is checked if it equals zero. To avoid returning True for the same triple more than once, we keep a track of seen triples using a set `seen`. If the condition is met for a triplet, we check if it has been seen before, and only if it hasn't, we add it to the `seen` set and return True. The function returns False if no such triple is found.

The following cases this algorithm is designed to pass:
```
* `triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])` - False
* `triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])` - True
* `triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])` - False
* `triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])` - True
* `triples_sum_to_zero([1])` - False
``` 
The corner case `triples_sum_to_zero([1])` is especially important for this algorithm to handle, as it returns False because there is no distinct triple (all pairs sum to zero).
