```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    # Write your code here. Read the DJANGO style guide.
    # The maximum number of iterations for the outer loop
    MAX_ITERATIONS = 1000
    for i in range(0, len(l)-2):
        for j in range(i+1, len(l)-1):
            for k in range(j+1, len(l)):
                if l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0:
                    return True
    return False
```

This code loops through all possible combinations of three elements in the list `l`, and returns `True` if it finds three distinct elements that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise. It does this using three nested loops, which is O(n^3), but the performance is acceptable given the maximum number of elements in the list is not specified and should be bounded anyway. 

The tests cases provided earlier correspond to the test cases built into Python's `unittest` module. You can use them by importing the module and writing test functions that start with the `@unittest.test` decorator. Here is an example:
```python
import unittest

def test_true(self):
    """Tests that true is returned when three distinct elements sum to zero"""
    self.assertTrue(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))

def test_false(self):
    """Tests that false is returned when less than three elements sum to zero"""
    self.assertFalse(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))

def test_list_with_one_element(self):
    """Tests that false is returned when the list has one element"""
    self.assertFalse(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))

class TestTriplesSumToZero(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_true(self):
        """Tests that true is returned when three distinct elements sum to zero"""
        self.assertTrue(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))

    def test_false(self):
        """Tests that false is returned when less than three elements sum to zero"""
        self.assertFalse(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))

    def test_list_with_one_element(self):
        """Tests that false is returned when the list has one element"""
        self.assertFalse(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))
```

This will run the tests when you call `python test_triples_sum_to_zero.py` (assuming you've saved the file with that name in the same directory as your `triples_sum_to_zero` function). 

Note that you need to run `pip install django` if you want to install the Django testing library which is used by the provided tests.
