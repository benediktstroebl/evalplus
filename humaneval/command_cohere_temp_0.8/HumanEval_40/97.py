This algorithm works by iterating through all pairs of elements in the list, and for each pair found, it iterates through the rest of the list to find the third distinct element that makes their sum equal to zero. To ensure that each triplet is checked only once, we use a set to store the encountered triplets. This way, we avoid checking the same triplet combinations multiple times and efficiently find the valid triplets that sum up to zero.  The code is commented with appropriate explanations, and the function's behavior is aligned with the expected results outlined in the problem statement.  This algorithm's time complexity is O(n^3) since it involves triple-loop iterations, and the space complexity is O(n) to store the encountered distinct triplets.
