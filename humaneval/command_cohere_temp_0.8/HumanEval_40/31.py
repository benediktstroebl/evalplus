```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst):
    # Write your code here. Read the markdown code block before proceeding.
    ts = tuple(zip(lst, lst[1:], lst[2:]))
    return any(sum(t) == 0 for t in ts if t[0] != t[1] and t[0] != t[2])
```

The provided code employs tuple unpacking and a list comprehension to construct three-element tuples within the list `lst`. It checks if the sum of each tuple is zero and returns `True` if any matching tuples are found, while ensuring that the checked tuples include three distinct elements.

The function ultimately determines whether a list contains three distinct elements that sum to zero, returning `True` or `False` accordingly. You can test it using the example inputs provided in the markdown code block, and they should all yield the expected outputs.
