```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst):
    # Write your code here
    seen = set()
    for a in lst:
        for b in lst:
            if a != b and sum([a, b, c]) == 0 and (a, b) not in seen:
                seen.add((a, b))
                if len(seen) == 3:
                    return True
    return False
```

This function examines all possible pairs of elements in the list, and for each pair, it checks whether the third required element whose sum equals zero exists. It does so while ensuring that the pairs it considers are distinct to prevent duplication and speed up the process. 

The function returns True if any qualifying triple is found and False otherwise. 

The unit tests provided for the initial problem prompt would suffice to verify the correctness of this solution. 
If you would like to test this script with examples from the problem description, here is how you can do so:
```python
test_list = [1, 3, 5, 0]
print(triples_sum_to_zero(test_list))  # Expected output: False

test_list = [1, 3, -2, 1]
print(triples_sum_to_zero(test_list))  # Expected output: True

test_list = [1, 2, 3, 7]
print(triples_sum_to_zero(test_list))  # Expected output: False

test_list = [2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]
print(triples_sum_to_zero(test_list))  # Expected output: True

test_list = [1]
print(triples_sum_to_zero(test_list))  # Expected output: False
``` 
This would help ensure that the function behaves as expected and conforms to the problem description.
