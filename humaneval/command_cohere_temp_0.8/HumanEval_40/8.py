```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst):
    # Using Counter to count occurrences of elements in the list
    counter = Counter(lst)
    
    # Filtering elements that can form a sum of zero with another element in the list
    candidates = [k for k, v in counter.items() if v > 1 and k != 0]
    
    # Checking if there are exactly two candidates and they form a pair that sums up to zero
    return len(candidates) == 2 and (sum(candidates) + counter[0]) == 0
```

The function utilizes Python's `Counter` class to identify potential candidates for forming a sum of zero with another element. The condition `v > 1` ensures that we only consider elements that have more than one occurrence and are therefore eligible to pair up with another element. The condition `k != 0` ensures that 0 is treated differently due to being a special case. Finally, the verification logic checks whether there are exactly two candidates and whether their combined sum (along with the count of 0s) equals zero, which indicates the existence of three distinct elements forming a sum of zero.

Here is a simpler alternative approach using numpy:
```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst):
    # Using numpy to identify triplets that sum to zero
    return len(numpy.nonzero(numpy.array(lst).sum(axis = 2) == 0)[1]) > 2
```
In this approach, the numpy array allows us to identify all unique triplets that sum up to zero, and the condition `len(...)>2` checks if there are more than two unique triplets, indicating that three distinct elements sum to zero. 

Both approaches have the same complexity of O(n^2) but result in different screenplay heights. I advise you to select the approach that suits your preferences and needs. Let me know if you would like to proceed with any of these or want to explore further alternatives to optimize the given problem.
