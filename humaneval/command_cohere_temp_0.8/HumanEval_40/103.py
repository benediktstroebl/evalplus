            if j == i or j in seen:

The algorithm works by picking an element from the list and then selecting another element in the list that, when added to the picked element, would sum to zero. Since we are looking for three elements, we then pick another element from the list, add it to the element that sums to zero, and return True if the result is zero. We use a set to keep track of the elements that have been seen before to avoid repetitions.

The test cases provided in the prompt return:
```
False
True
False
True
False
```
