        if x < 0:
            for j, y in enumerate(l[i+1:]):
                if y < 0 and x + y > 0 and j != i + 1 and (i, x, y) not in seen:
                    seen.add((i, x, y))

The algorithm works by checking each negative element in the list and trying to combine it with another element to sum up to zero. The loop iterates through all the other elements, excluding the previous one as to avoid repetition. If it finds such a pair, it flags it by adding it to the seen set. Then it checks if there's a third distinct element that completes the triplet, whose sum is zero. If it's successful for any negative element, it returns True, otherwise, it returns False. 
The tests are omitted, and you can add them to verify the correctness of the algorithm. It is important to ensure that the list contains at least three distinct elements and at least one of them is negative to catch any potential bugs in the code. 
If your primary goal is to create a solution for a coding problem, checking your code with tests is always a good practice to ensure it behaves as expected on different inputs. It also improves the readability of your code for others who might use it. Since the algorithm employs a rather straightforward approach, the code is relatively simple. Still, for an even clearer and more concise solution, you might want to consider using nested loops instead of a nested for loop and enumerate loops, which are believed to make the code more readable. Here's how that version would look:
```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    seen = set()
    for i, x in enumerate(l):
        if x < 0:
            for j, y in enumerate(l[i+1:]):
                if x + y > 0 and j != i + 1 and (i, x, y) not in seen:
                    seen.add((i, x, y))
                    if l[k] > 0 and x + y + l[k] == 0 and k != i and k != j:
                        return True
                        break
    return False
``` 
Let me know if the explanation helps or if you'd like me to adjust it to better suit your needs.  feel free to ask for tests too if you want to complete the code and verify its correctness.
