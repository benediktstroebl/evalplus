    for a in l:
        if a == 0:
            continue
        seen.add(a)
        for b in l:
            if b == 0:

This algorithm works by taking a list of integers and checking if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero. The code uses a set to keep track of the distinct values in the list to avoid repeating work. To iterate through the list, it checks if each value is zero and, if so, continues to the next iteration. If the value is not zero, it adds it to the set of seen values. Then, for each value in the list, it checks if the value plus a previously seen value equals the third value, and if so, it returns True. If the end of the loop completes without finding a matching triple, it returns False. 

Here is an example usage of this code:
```python
>>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
False
>>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
True
>>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
False
>>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])
True
>>> triples_sum_to_zero([1])
False
```

This will return the following markdown code block:
```python

    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
