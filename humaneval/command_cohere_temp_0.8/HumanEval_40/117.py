```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst):
    seen = set()
    for a in lst:
        for b in lst:
            if a != b and a + b in seen:
                return True
            seen.add(a)
    return False
```

This function uses a set data structure to efficiently keep track of seen elements to avoid duplicates that could lead to false positives. It iterates through the list lst twice, checking if the current element a is part of a valid trio that sums up to zero. If a candidate trio is found, the function returns True. If the function iterates through the entire list without finding a valid trio, it returns False. This approach is efficient and easy to understand, making it a ideal solution for this scenario.
