```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst):
    # Define possible pairs with differences summing to zero
    pairs = [(x, lst[idx + 1] - x) for idx, x in enumerate(lst) if x != lst[idx + 1]]
    return len(pairs) == 3 and all(sum(p) == 0 for p in pairs)
```

This function examines each pair of elements in the list, calculating their differences and checking if they sum to zero. It returns True if exactly three such pairs are found and their sum is zero, indicating three distinct elements that sum to zero. If these conditions aren't met, it returns False. The given tests would be defined as follows:
```python
>>> test = [([1, 3, 5, 0], False), ([1, 3, -2, 1], True), ([1, 2, 3, 7], False), ([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7], True), ([1], False)]
>>> for t in test:
...     assert triples_sum_to_zero(*t) == t[1]
```

Providing a test suite for validation ensures the function operates correctly across different scenarios.
