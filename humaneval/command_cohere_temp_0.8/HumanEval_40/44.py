This code employs a nested loop to efficiently check if three distinct elements in the list sum up to zero. It initially searches for a pair of distinct elements a and b, ensuring b is positive and not equal to a, and checks if their sum is zero. Subsequently, it verifies if the sum of a third element c with the previously found pair (a, b) is zero. If these conditions are met, it returns 'True'. To prevent duplication, the code adds combinations (a, b) and (b, c) to a set. This approach avoids unnecessary checks and optimizes the detection of triplets that sum to zero.
