Here's a Python code block that contains a function called `decimal_to_binary` which takes a decimal number as input and returns the binary representation of that number with extra '0's and '1's at the beginning and end of the representation:
```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    binary = bin(decimal).replace('0b', 'db').rjust(len(str(decimal)), '0')
    return binary + 'db'

# Test Cases
assert decimal_to_binary(15) == 'db1111db'
assert decimal_to_binary(32) == 'db100000db'
```

The function achieves this by using the built-in `bin` function, which converts an integer to a binary string. The string is then modified to add the extra 'db' characters at the beginning and end of the string and to right-justify the binary representation with '0' characters so that the length of the string is the same as the length of the decimal number. Finally, the modified string is returned.
