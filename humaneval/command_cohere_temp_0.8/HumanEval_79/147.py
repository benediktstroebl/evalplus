Here's a Python code block that contains a function called `decimal_to_binary` which takes a decimal number as input and returns the binary representation of that number with extra "db" characters at the beginning and end of the string:
```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    binary = bin(decimal).replace('0b', 'db').rjust(len(str(decimal)), '0')
    return f"db{binary}db"
```

This function uses the built-in `bin` function to convert the decimal number to a binary string. The `replace` method is used to replace `0b` with `db` at the beginning of the string. The `rjust` method ensures that the binary string is centered with identical length as the decimal number, by adding padding `0` to the left if necessary. Finally, the function returns a string that starts and ends with "db" followed by the binary representation of the number. 

This should produce the desired output for the example cases, which are "db1111db" for 15 and "db100000db" for 32. Note that this assumes that the input is a valid decimal number comprised of the characters '0' to '9' and that the output is a string that contains '0' and '1'. 

This approach covers the specified examples, however, keep in mind that this doesn't account for any potential errors in the input (e.g., the input not representing a valid decimal number). If you'd like to include input validation, you can incorporate exception handling with `try` and `except` blocks.
