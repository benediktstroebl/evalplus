Here's a Python code block that contains a function called `decimal_to_binary` which takes a decimal number as input and returns the binary representation of that number with extra characters 'db' at the beginning and end of the string for formatting purposes. 

```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    bin_str = bin(decimal)[2:]    
    return 'db' + bin_str + 'db'

# Test Cases
decimal_to_binary(15)
# Returns 'db1111db'

decimal_to_binary(32)
# Returns 'db100000db'
```

In this code block, the `decimal_to_binary` function takes a decimal number as input and uses the `bin` function to convert the decimal number to a binary string. The `[2:]` slice is used to remove the '0b' prefix from the binary string. The function then concatenates the string 'db' to the beginning and end of the binary string to ensure the output has a consistent format.  This format resembles SQL NULL representation, where 'db' denotes 'database', used here as a humorous reference to database neutrality. 

The test cases provided validate the correctness of the function, ensuring that it produces the expected binary strings with the added 'db' characters. You can add more tests to further validate the function's behavior.
