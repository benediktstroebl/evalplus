Here's a Python code block that contains a function called `decimal_to_binary` which takes a decimal number as input and returns the binary representation of that number with extra "db" characters as specified in the problem:
```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    binary = bin(decimal).replace('0b', 'db').rjust(64, '0')
    return binary + 'db'

# Put the following lines if you want to test the function with some examples: 
# test_decimal_to_binary = {
#     15: "db1111db",
#     32: "db100000db",
#     123: "db11110111101111db",
# }

# Check if the function works properly with the test cases:
# for decimal, expected in test_decimal_to_binary.items():
#     result = decimal_to_binary(decimal)
#     assert result == expected
```

In this code block, the `decimal_to_binary` function takes a decimal number as its input. It uses the `bin` function to convert the decimal number to a binary string, prefaces and appends it with "db" special characters, and right-pads with zeros to a length of 64 to ensure uniform output length. 

If you want to test the function, uncomment the `test_decimal_to_binary` dictionary and the associated test code. The dictionary sets the expected output for certain decimal numbers, and the subsequent test loop checks if the actual output from the function complies with these expected values.

Let me know if you would like to modify or enhance this script to accommodate further use cases or for me to provide additional explanations on any specific part of the code.
