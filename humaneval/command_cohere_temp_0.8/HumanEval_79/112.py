Here's a Python code block that contains a function called `decimal_to_binary` which takes a decimal number as input and returns the binary representation of that number with extra "db" characters at the beginning and end of the string:
```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    bin_str = bin(decimal)[2:]
    return "db" + bin_str + "db"

# Test Cases
decimal_values = [15, 32]
expected_results = ['db1111db', 'db100000db']

for dec, expected in zip(decimal_values, expected_results):
    result = decimal_to_binary(dec)
    assert result == expected
```

This script defines the `decimal_to_binary` function, taking a decimal number as input and returning the binary representation with the specified format. The test case section includes a list of decimal numbers and the corresponding expected binary results. The `zip` function is used to iterate through the decimal numbers and expected results simultaneously. The `decimal_to_binary` function is applied to each decimal number, and the result is compared to the expected binary output using the `assert` statement.

This code will compile and run without issues, producing the specified output and passing the given tests. I hope this helps, let me know if you need anything else!
