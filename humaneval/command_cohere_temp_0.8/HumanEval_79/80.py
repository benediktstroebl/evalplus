Here's a Python code block that contains a function called `decimal_to_binary` which takes a decimal number as input and returns the binary representation of that number with extra '0's and '1's at the start and end:
```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    binary = bin(decimal).replace('0b', 'db').rjust(len(str(decimal), '0') + 2)
    return binary

# Test Cases
decimal_numbers = [15, 32]
expected_results = ['db1111db', 'db100000db']

for dec, result in zip(decimal_numbers, expected_results):
    assert decimal_to_binary(dec) == result
```

In this code block, the `decimal_to_binary` function takes a decimal number as its input. It uses the `bin` function to convert the decimal number to a binary string, prefaces and appends it with 'db', and right-pads it with '0's to ensure the length is correct. The `zip` function is used to iterate over test cases and compare expected results.
