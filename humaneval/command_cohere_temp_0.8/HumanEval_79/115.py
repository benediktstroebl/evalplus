Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the decimal-to-binary problem according to the provided Markdown code block:
```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    """Convert a decimal number to binary format."""
    db_prefix = "db"
    db_suffix = "db"
    
    # Convert decimal to binary
    binary = bin(decimal)[2:]
    
    # Add leading zeros if needed
    zeropad = len(db_prefix) - len(binary)
    binary = ("0" * zeropad) + binary
    
    # Append db prefixes and suffixes
    binary = db_prefix + binary + db_suffix
    
    return binary

# Test cases
assert decimal_to_binary(15) == "db1111db"
assert decimal_to_binary(32) == "db100000db"
```

This script defines the `decimal_to_binary` function, which takes a decimal number as its argument and returns the binary representation with the leading 'db' characters. The script also includes test cases to verify the function's behavior against the provided examples in the problem statement.
