Here's a Python code block that contains a function called `decimal_to_binary` which takes a decimal number as input and returns the binary representation of that number with extra characters 'db' at the start and end of the string for formatting purposes.
```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    bin_string = bin(decimal)[2:]
    return 'db' + bin_string + 'db'

# Test Cases
decimal_values = [15, 32]
expected_results = ['db1111db', 'db100000db']

for dec, expected in zip(decimal_values, expected_results):
    result = decimal_to_binary(dec)
    assert result == expected
```

This script defines the `decimal_to_binary` function, taking a decimal number as input and returning the binary representation with '0' and '1' characters, starting and ending with 'db' for formatting. It then tests this function with two test cases, checking if the returned values match the expected binary strings. The `zip` function is used to iterate through decimals and expected results simultaneously.
