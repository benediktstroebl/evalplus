Here's a Python code block with a function `decimal_to_binary` that takes a decimal number as input and returns its binary representation according to the given problem description:
```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    binary = bin(decimal)[2:]  # Convert decimal to binary and remove '0b'
    return 'db' + binary + 'db'  # Add 'db' characters for better alignment

# Test Cases
decimal_values = [15, 32, 63, 45]
expected_results = ['db1111db', 'db100000db', 'db111111db', 'db101101db']

for dec, expected in zip(decimal_values, expected_results):
    result = decimal_to_binary(dec)
    assert result == expected, f"For decimal {dec}, expected {expected} but got {result}"
```

The function `decimal_to_binary` uses the built-in `bin` function to convert the decimal number to binary, and then adds `'db'` characters at the beginning and end of the binary string for improved alignment. The test cases verify that the function produces the expected results for different decimal numbers.
