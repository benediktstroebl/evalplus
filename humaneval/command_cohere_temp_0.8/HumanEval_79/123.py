Here's a Python code block with a function `decimal_to_binary` that takes a decimal number as input and returns its binary representation according to the provided problem description:
```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    binary = bin(decimal).replace('0b', 'db').rjust(64, '0')
    return binary

# Test Cases
decimal_numbers = [15, 32]
expected_results = ['db1111db', 'db100000db']

for dec, result in zip(decimal_numbers, expected_results):
    assert decimal_to_binary(dec) == result
```

In this code block, the `decimal_to_binary` function takes a decimal number as its input. It uses the `bin` function to convert the decimal number to a binary representation, prepending `db` to the result to account for the added characters in the problem description. The `replace` method removes the `0b` prefix and the `rjust` method pads the binary string with `0` characters to a length of 64, again to match the problem's specifics. Finally, the function returns the formatted binary string.

The test cases validate the function's behavior by converting decimal numbers to binary and comparing the results to the expected values.
