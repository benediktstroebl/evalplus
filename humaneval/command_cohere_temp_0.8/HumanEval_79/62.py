Here's a Python code block that contains a function called `decimal_to_binary` which takes a decimal number as input and returns the binary representation of that number with extra characters 'db' at the beginning and end of the string for formatting purposes. 

```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    bin_string = bin(decimal)[2:]
    return 'db' + bin_string + 'db'

# Test Cases
decimal_numbers = [15, 32]
expected_results = ['db1111db', 'db100000db']

for dec, result in zip(decimal_numbers, expected_results):
    assert decimal_to_binary(dec) == result
```

This script defines the `decimal_to_binary` function, taking a decimal number as input and returning the binary representation with '0' and '1' characters, prefaced and followed by 'db'. It then tests this function against sample decimal numbers, ensuring that the output is as expected. 

The test case ensures that the function works correctly for the examples provided in the problem statement by comparing the returned strings with the expected binary representations. 

Note that the `zip` function is used to iterate over the `decimal_numbers` and `expected_results` list simultaneously in the test case. This is done to compare each decimal number with its corresponding expected binary representation string.
