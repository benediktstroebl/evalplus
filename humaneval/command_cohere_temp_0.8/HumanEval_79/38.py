Here's a Python script that solves the problem of converting a decimal number to a binary string, with self-explanatory function and variable names to make the code more accessible:
```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    binary = bin(decimal)[2:]
    return f"db{binary}db"

# Test Cases
decimal_values = [15, 32, 64, 7]
expected_binary = ["db1111db", "db100000db", "db1000000db", "db0111db"]

for dec, bin_ in zip(decimal_values, expected_binary):
    assert decimal_to_binary(dec) == bin_
```

This code defines a function `decimal_to_binary` that takes a decimal number as its argument and converts it to its binary representation, encapsulated within "db" brackets, accordingly. The code then tests the function with a list of decimal numbers and asserts that the resulting binary strings are as expected.
