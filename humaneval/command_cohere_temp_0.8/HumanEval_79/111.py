Here's a Python code block with a function `decimal_to_binary` that completes the specified task:
```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    """Returns a string representing the binary equivalent of the decimal number, with extra '0's and '1's for formatting."""
    bin_str = bin(decimal).replace('0b', 'db').rjust(len(str(decimal)), '0')
    return f"db{bin_str}db"
```

This code block provides a Python function that takes in a decimal number as input and returns the binary representation of that number. It utilizes the built-in `bin` function in Python which returns the binary representation of a number, and then performs some minor manipulations to add the specified leading and trailing characters for formatting.

Note that this code assumes and is fitted for the specified problem scenario, where the input decimal numbers are effectively constrained by the function's body and the function's output should inherently fit within the boundaries of a string data type.
