Here's a Python code block that contains a function called `decimal_to_binary` which takes a decimal number as input and returns the binary representation of that number with extra "db" characters at the beginning and end of the string for formatting purposes. 

The function adheres to the problem description provided and is re-createable without reliance on any external variables or functions:
```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    bin_str = "{0:b}".format(decimal)
    return "db{0}db".format(bin_str)
```

In this implementation, the built-in `format` method is used to convert the binary representation of the number to a string. The `{0:b}`.format(decimal) syntax transforms the decimal number to a binary string, where `0b` prefixes binary numbers in Python. Then, the `db{0}db` formatting adds the "db" characters at the beginning and end of the string.
