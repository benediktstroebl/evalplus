Here's a Python code block with a function `decimal_to_binary` that takes a decimal number as input and returns its binary representation according to the provided problem description:
```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    binary = bin(decimal)[2:]
    return f"db{binary}db"
```

This function takes a decimal number as input and converts it to its binary representation. The `bin` function converts the decimal number to a binary string prefixed with '0b'. The expression `[2:]` is used to remove these prefixes. Finally, the function returns the binary string surrounded by 'db' characters to maintain the specified format.

This code block can be imported and called directly in your Python environment to solve the associated problem. 

For example:
```python
import decimal_to_binary
result = decimal_to_binary.decimal_to_binary(32)
print(result)  # Outputs: "db100000db"
``` 

This would print the binary representation of the number 32 surrounded by the 'db' characters.
