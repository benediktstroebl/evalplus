Here's a Python code block that contains a function called `decimal_to_binary` which takes a decimal number as input and returns the binary representation of that number with extra characters 'db' at the beginning and end of the string for formatting purposes. 

The function `decimal_to_binary` is defined as follows:
```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    bin_string = bin(decimal)[2:]
    return 'db' + bin_string + 'db'
```

The `decimal_to_binary` function uses the `bin` function to convert the decimal number to a binary string, but it does not include the initial '0b' prefix in the result. It then takes this binary string and appends the extra characters 'db' at the beginning and end of the string for formatting purposes.

This solution is straightforward and effectively converts decimal numbers to binary representations with the specified formatting.

Here's an example of how you can use the function with the decimal number 15:
```python
result = decimal_to_binary(15)
print(result)  # Output: db1111db
```

And here's an example with the decimal number 32:
```python
result = decimal_to_binary(32)
print(result)  # Output: db100000db
```

These examples correctly demonstrate the desired behavior of formatting the binary representations with the extra 'db' characters at the beginning and end of the string.
