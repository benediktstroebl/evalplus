Here's a Python code block that contains a function called `decimal_to_binary` which takes a decimal number as input and returns the binary representation of that number with extra "db" characters at the beginning and end of the string for formatting purposes. 

```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    bin_string = bin(decimal)[2:]
    return "db" + bin_string + "db"

# Test Cases
decimal_numbers = [15, 32]
expected_results = ['db1111db', 'db100000db']

for dec, result in zip(decimal_numbers, expected_results):
    assert decimal_to_binary(dec) == result
```

This script defines the `decimal_to_binary` function, taking a decimal number as input and returning the binary representation with the specified formatting. It uses the built-in `bin` function to get the binary representation of the decimal number, and then appends the extra "db" characters at the beginning and end of the string.

The script also includes a simple test case with `decimal_numbers` and `expected_results` to verify that the function behaves as expected for a few different inputs. It uses the `zip` function to iterate over the decimal numbers and expected results simultaneously and uses the `assert` statement to verify that the output of the `decimal_to_binary` function matches the expected result for each decimal number.  This helps to ensure the correct behavior of the function and verifies it produces the expected outputs.  If you run this code block directly in a Python environment, it will execute the `decimal_to_binary` function and print the results.  However, since this is a self-contained code block, there is no output by default.  If you would like to see the results printed, you could add a `print` statement to the end of the code block.  For example: 
 ```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    bin_string = bin(decimal)[2:]
    return "db" + bin_string + "db"

# Test Cases
decimal_numbers = [15, 32]
expected_results = ['db1111db', 'db100000db']

for dec, result in zip(decimal_numbers, expected_results):
    assert decimal_to_binary(dec) == result

for dec, result in zip(decimal_numbers, expected_results):
    print(f"Input={dec}, Output={result}")
``` 

This addition of a `print` statement at the end will print each input decimal number and its corresponding output to the console.  It is important to note that in order to execute this code, you will need to copy the entire code block into a Python environment or script and run it from there.  Simply typing '**`python`**' will not allow you to execute a code block within a code block.  You could also copy and paste the individual '**`def decimal_to_binary()`**' and '**`test case`**' code blocks into a separate Python environment or script to run them separately, if you would like.
