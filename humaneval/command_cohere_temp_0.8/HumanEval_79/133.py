Here's a Python code block that contains a function called `decimal_to_binary` which takes a decimal number as input and returns the binary representation of that number with extra '0's and '1's at the start and end of the representation:
```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    bin_str = bin(decimal)[2:]
    return 'db' + bin_str + 'db'

# Test Cases
decimal_numbers = [15, 32]
expected_results = ['db1111db', 'db100000db']

for dec, result in zip(decimal_numbers, expected_results):
    assert decimal_to_binary(dec) == result
```

In this code block, the function `decimal_to_binary` takes a decimal number as input and uses the built-in `bin` function to convert the decimal number to a binary number. The `bin` function returns a string consisting of `0b` followed by the binary representation of the number, so we use `bin(decimal)[2:]` to skip the `0b` part. The function then adds the characters 'db' at the beginning and end of the string for the extra characters specified in the problem statement. Finally, the function returns the modified string.

The test cases at the bottom ensure that the function behaves as expected for the given inputs. The `zip` function is used to iterate over the decimal numbers and their expected results in parallel, and the `assert` statement checks that the output of the `decimal_to_binary` function matches the expected result for each decimal number.
