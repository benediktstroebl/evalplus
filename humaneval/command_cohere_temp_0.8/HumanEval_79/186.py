Here's a Python code block that contains a function called `decimal_to_binary` which takes a decimal number as input and returns the binary representation of that number with extra "db" characters at the beginning and end of the string:
```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    bin_str = bin(decimal)[2:]
    return "db" + bin_str + "db"

# Test Cases
decimal_numbers = [15, 32]
expected_results = ['db1111db', 'db100000db']

for dec, expected in zip(decimal_numbers, expected_results):
    result = decimal_to_binary(dec)
    assert result == expected
```

This script defines the `decimal_to_binary` function, taking a decimal number as input and returning the binary representation with the specified format. The code block includes test cases that validate the function's behavior against expected outputs for two different input decimal numbers.

The `bin` function is used to convert the decimal number to a binary string, and the `[2:]` slice is used to remove the '0b' prefix. The "db" characters are then prepended and appended to provide the desired format. The zip function is used to iterate over the decimal numbers and their expected results, and the `decimal_to_binary` function is invoked in each iteration to convert the decimal numbers to binary. The `assert` statement checks if the actual result of the function is equal to the expected result for each test case, ensuring they match.

Feel free to modify the test cases or the function itself to suit your needs! Let me know if you would like to deepen or adapt the code to other situations. I am here to help! 

Please note that the code is formatted with a tab width of 4 spaces for better readability. If you prefer a different formatting, you can adjust it. Let me know if you have any other questions or additional requirements!
