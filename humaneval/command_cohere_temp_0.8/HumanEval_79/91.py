Here's a Python script that solves the problem of converting a decimal number to a binary string, with the added specification of including "db" characters as you've described:
```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    """
    Convert a decimal number to binary format, with db prefixes and suffixes.
    """
    binary = bin(decimal).replace('0b', 'db').rjust(len(str(decimal)), '0')
    return f"db{binary}db"

# Test cases
decimal_values = [15, 32, 45]
expected_results = [
    "db1111db",
    "db100000db",
    "db1010011db"
]

for dec, result in zip(decimal_values, expected_results):
    assert decimal_to_binary(dec) == result
```
This script defines the `decimal_to_binary` function as per the specification, and then tests it against the provided test cases. When the function is called, it will return the binary string with the required "db" characters.
