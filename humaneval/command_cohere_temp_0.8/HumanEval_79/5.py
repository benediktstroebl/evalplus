Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the decimal-to-binary problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    """Converts a decimal number to its binary representation, with extra '0's and '1's for correct formatting."""
    binary = bin(decimal).replace('0b', 'db').rjust(len(str(decimal)), '0')
    return binary + 'db'

# Example usage:
decimal_value = 15
binary_result = decimal_to_binary(decimal_value)
print(f"The binary representation of {decimal_value} is {binary_result}")
```

In this code, the built-in `bin` function is used to convert the decimal number to its binary representation. The `replace` method is used to replace the '0b' prefix with 'db' for formatting. The `rjust` method ensures that the binary string is padded with '0's on the left to match the length of the decimal number. The resulting binary string is then appended with 'db' at the end.
