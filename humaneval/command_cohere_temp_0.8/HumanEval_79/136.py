Here's a Python code block with a function `decimal_to_binary` that takes a decimal number as input and returns its binary representation, with extra `db` characters as specified in the problem statement:
```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    binary = bin(decimal)[2:]  # Remove '0b' from binary representation
    return 'db' + binary + 'db'

# Test Cases
decimal_values = [15, 32, 63, 45]
expected_results = ['db1111db', 'db100000db', 'db111111db', 'db10101db']

for dec, result in zip(decimal_values, expected_results):
    assert decimal_to_binary(dec) == result
```

This script defines the `decimal_to_binary` function as requested, and it provides test cases to validate its correctness against expected outputs. You can use this code block directly to solve the problem.
