Here's a Python code block that contains a function called `decimal_to_binary` which takes a decimal number as input and returns the binary representation of that number with extra "db" characters as specified in the problem:
```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    binary = bin(decimal).replace('0b', 'db').rjust(64, '0')
    return binary + 'db'

# Test Cases
decimal_numbers = [15, 32]
expected_results = ['db1111db', 'db100000db']

for dec, result in zip(decimal_numbers, expected_results):
    assert decimal_to_binary(dec) == result
```

This script defines the `decimal_to_binary` function that takes in a decimal number and converts it to binary. It uses the `bin` function to convert the decimal number to a binary string, then replaces the "0b" prefix with "db" as specified in the problem. The `rjust(64, '0')` ensures that the binary string is 64 characters long (padding with extra zeros if necessary), making the result look like "db1111111111111db" rather than "db10001110110100db" for the example of 32. The function then returns the padded binary string along with the extra "db" characters at the beginning and end.

The script then tests the function with the provided test cases in the context and checks that the output of the function matches the expected results.
