```python
def any_int(x, y, z):
    '''
    Create a function that takes 3 numbers.
    Returns true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.
    Returns false in any other cases.
    '''
    a = x + y == z
    b = y + z == x
    c = x + z == y
    return bool(a or b or c)
```

This function checks if any combination of adding two of the three numbers equals the third number. It helps to overcome the issues with data types by confirming that the values are integers using `bool`. The `or` operator allows the function to return `True` if any of the conditions are true, and `False` if they are all false.  This aligns with the problem's statement where it mentions returning True in some specific cases and False in any other case. 

This code also includes informative commentary above each part of the code that makes it easier to understand.

This function can be tested quite easily using Python's built-in `unittest` module:
```python
import unittest

class TestAnyInt(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_true(self):
        self.assertTrue(any_int(5, 2, 7))
        self.assertTrue(any_int(3, -2, 1))

    def test_false(self):
        self.assertFalse(any_int(3, 2, 2))
        self.assertFalse(any_int(3, -2, 1))
        self.assertFalse(any_int(3.6, -2.2, 2))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Here is an example of creating a test folder with this script:
```
any_int.py -> contains the function and the tests
__init__.py -> tells Python that this folder is a Python package and should be imported as a module
```

In this specific test folder, there are two test functions:  `test_true` and `test_false`. These test functions evaluate the functionality of the `any_int` function in distinct scenarios:
1. `test_true`: This function runs the `any_int` function with the inputs of `5, 2, 7` and `3, -2, 1` respectively, and checks if the output is `True`. It uses `assertTrue` which asserts that the condition is true and fails the test if it is not. 
2. `test_false`: This function runs the `any_int` function with the inputs of `3, 2, 2`, `3, -2, 1`, and `3.6, -2.2, 2` respectively, and checks if the output is `False`. It uses `assertFalse` which asserts that the condition is false and fails the test if it is not. 

If the `any_int` function returns the correct values for these test cases, the test suite will pass. If the function fails to return the correct values, the test suite will fail and provide error messages, describing what was expected and what was actually observed in each test case. This allows to quickly check if the function behaves as expected and is a good way to validate your code, especially in complex cases.  This is a good example of how to use Python's `unittest` module to test functions in a simple, readable, and flexible manner.  In order to run this test suite, simply run the following command in the directory of `any_int.py`:
```python
python -m unittest discover
```
