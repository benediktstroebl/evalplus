```python
def any_int(x, y, z):
    '''
    Create a function that takes 3 numbers.
    Returns true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.
    Returns false in any other cases.
    '''
    a = x + y == z
    b = y + z == x
    c = x + z == y
    return bool(a or b or c)
```

This function checks if any combination of adding two of the three numbers equals the third number. The `bool()` function is used to convert the result into a boolean type. 

This solution corresponds to the test cases provided in the problem statement. Feel free to experiment with additional cases to ensure that the function behaves as expected.
