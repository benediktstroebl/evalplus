```python
def any_int(x, y, z):
    '''
    Create a function that takes 3 numbers.
    Returns true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.
    Returns false in any other cases.
    '''
    a = x + y == z
    b = y + z == x
    c = x + z == y
    return a or b or c
```

This function checks if any combination of the three variables adds up to the other variable. It works with the basic principle of equations and returns true if any of these conditions are true. Note that this function assumes that integers have no decimal values. If the given inputs are floating numbers, the function will return false.
