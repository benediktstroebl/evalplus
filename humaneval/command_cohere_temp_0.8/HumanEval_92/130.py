```python
def any_int(x, y, z):
    '''
    Create a function that takes 3 numbers.
    Returns true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.
    Returns false in any other cases.
    '''
    a = x + y == z
    b = y + z == x
    c = x + z == y
    return a or b or c
```

This function checks if any combination of the three variables adds up to the other variable. Once the variables are summed, it checks if the type of the result is an integer, returning False if it is a float. The overall time complexity of the function is `O(1)`, and the space complexity is `O(1)` since it only performs a few arithmetic operations and simple comparisons.
