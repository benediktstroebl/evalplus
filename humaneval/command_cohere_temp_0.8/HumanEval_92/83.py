```python
def any_int(x, y, z):
    """
    Create a function that takes 3 numbers.
    Returns true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.
    Returns false in any other cases.
    """
    a = x + y == z
    b = y + z == x
    c = x + z == y
    return bool(a or b or c)
```

This function evaluates the three conditions `a`, `b`, and `c`, each comparing one of the three input values to the sum of the other two. Then it returns `True` if any of these conditions is `True`, and `False` otherwise. This behavior matches the specification laid out in the prompt.

Here is a simple test suite to ensure that the function behaves as expected:
```python
# Test any_int function
def test_any_int():
    assert any_int(5, 2, 7) == True
assert any_int(3, 2, 2) == False
assert any_int(3, -2, 1) == True
assert any_int(3.6, -2.2, 2) == False
```
This test suite consists of four individual tests, each testing a specific case outlined in the original prompt. You can use `assert` statements to check that the output of `any_int` is correct for each specific case.  These tests would be useful for ensuring that the function behaves as expected in various scenarios.
