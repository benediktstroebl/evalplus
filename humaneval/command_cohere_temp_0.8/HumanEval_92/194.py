```python
def any_int(x, y, z):
    """
    Create a function that takes 3 numbers.
    Returns true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.
    Returns false in any other cases.
    """
    a = x + y == z
    b = y + z == x
    c = x + z == y
    return a or b or c
```

This function checks if any combination of the three variables adds up to the other variable. Once the appropriate variables are identified, it returns `True`. If all three variables have differing values, it returns `False`. 

This approach gives logical reasoning to determine the truthfulness of the statement without resorting to brute force.
