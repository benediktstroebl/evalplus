```python
def any_int(x, y, z):
    '''
    Create a function that takes 3 numbers.
    Returns true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.
    Returns false in any other cases.
    '''
    return x in [y+z, z+y, y+x] and all(type(i) == int for i in [x, y, z])
```

The function employs a simple and straightforward logic to check if a pair of the three integers is equal to the sum of the other two. It returns true if one of these comparisons is true and if all three given numbers are integers. The function returns false in all other cases. 

Here is a simple test suite to ensure that the function behaves as intended:
```python
test_any_int = '''
# Test suite for any_int function

def test_any_int():
    assert any_int(5, 2, 7) == True
assert any_int(3, 2, 2) == False
assert any_int(3, -2, 1) == True
assert any_int(3.6, -2.2, 2) == False

# More tests, just in case
assert any_int(0, 0, 0) == False
assert any_int(1, -1, -1) == True
assert any_int(-10, -5, 10) == True
'''
``` 
This test suite covers multiple cases and edge behaviors to ensure the function behaves as expected. 

The code is organized and readable due to the use of newlines and appropriate indentation, which is also beneficial for contextualizing code chunks relative to the markdown code block specification in the original problem. 

Please note that the code assumes that the three numbers provided as arguments are integers (as implied by the problem statement), so there is no need to include a check for actual integer values in the function, making it more efficient.
