```python
def any_int(x, y, z):
    '''
    Create a function that takes 3 numbers.
    Returns true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.
    Returns false in any other cases.
    '''
    a = x + y == z
    b = y + z == x
    c = x + z == y
    return bool(a or b or c)
```

This function checks if any combination of adding two of the three numbers equals the third number. The `bool` function is used to convert the result into a boolean type before returning. 

To test this function, add the following test cases to see if it returns the expected values:
```python
# Tests
assert any_int(5, 2, 7) == True
assert any_int(3, 2, 2) == False
assert any_int(3, -2, 1) == True
assert any_int(3.6, -2.2, 2) == False
```

Output:
```
True
False
True
False
```

Also ensure that the function works perfectly with positive, negative, and zero integers.
