```python
def any_int(x, y, z):
    '''
    Create a function that takes 3 numbers.
    Returns true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.
    Returns false in any other cases.
    '''
    return x in [y+z, z+y, y+x] and all([type(i) == int for i in [x, y, z]])
```

This function checks if one of the three numbers is equal to the sum of the other two. Then it checks if all three numbers are integers. If both conditions are met, it returns True, otherwise, it returns False. The function is self-contained and does not rely on any external variables or functions. 

Here is an example of how you might test this function:
```python
# tests
test_cases = [
    (5, 2, 7, True),
    (3, 2, 2, False),
    (3, -2, 1, True),
    (3.6, -2.2, 2, False)
]

for x, y, z, expected in test_cases:
    assert any_int(x, y, z) == expected
```

The test suite includes four distinct cases, each testing a different set of input values and expecting a specific outcome, reflecting the examples provided in the problem statement.
