```python
def any_int(x, y, z):
    '''
    Create a function that takes 3 numbers.
    Returns true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.
    Returns false in any other cases.
    '''
    a = x + y == z
    b = y + z == x
    c = x + z == y
    return a or b or c
```

This function checks if any combination of the three variables adds up to the other variable. Once the variables are defined, a logical operator(or) is used to determine if any of the conditions are true. 

Here is a test to ensure that the code works:
```python
def test_any_int():
    assert any_int(5, 2, 7) == True
    assert any_int(3, 2, 2) == False
    assert any_int(3, -2, 1) == True
    assert any_int(3.6, -2.2, 2) == False
```

The tests pass with the correct result for each call to the `any_int` function.
