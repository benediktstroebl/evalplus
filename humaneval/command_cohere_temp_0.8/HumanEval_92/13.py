```python
def any_int(x, y, z):
    """
    Create a function that takes 3 numbers.
    Returns true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.
    Returns false in any other cases.
    """
    a = x + y
    b = y + z
    c = x + z
    
    if a == int(a) and b == int(b) and c == int(c) and (a == b or a == c or b == c):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

The function performs the necessary calculations and checks whether the sum of any two of the numbers is equal to the third number, and that all three values are integers. It returns `True` if the conditions are met and `False` otherwise. 
To test this function, you can write a test code snippet:
```python
# Test any_int()

def test_any_int():
    assert any_int(5, 2, 7) == True
```

This would verify the function's behavior for the specific test case mentioned in the problem statement.
