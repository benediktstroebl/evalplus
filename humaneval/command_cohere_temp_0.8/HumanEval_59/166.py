```python
def largest_prime_factor(n):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime."""
    # Breadth-first search of prime factors
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
            yield i
        i += 1
    if n > 1:
        yield n

```
The function largest_prime_factor(n) returns the largest prime factor of the positive integer n, assuming that n is not 1 and is not a prime itself.

The algorithm uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to finding prime factors. It starts with the factors of 2, then moves on to factors of 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on, progressively moving up the number line, always searching for the largest prime factor. 

This BFS strategy ensures that the largest prime factor is found correctly, as it prioritizes smaller factors first, avoiding unnecessary iterations with larger factors. 

The yield statement allows the function to yield each prime factor one at a time, ensuring that if n is divisible by a prime multiple times, each occurrence of the prime will be yielded. 

Finally, if n remains greater than 1 at the end of the loop, it itself is a prime, so it's yielded as the largest prime factor. This handles the case where n is a prime number. 

The function docstring summarizes its purpose and provides example test cases, ensuring the function is well-documented and prepared for usage in various scenarios. 

This sophisticated approach improves upon naive implementations, which might mistakenly stop searching for factors once they've found the smallest prime factor. In contrast, the BFS approach is assured to discover the largest prime factor, making it a more efficient and effective solution.
