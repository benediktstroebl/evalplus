```python
def largest_prime_factor(n):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime."""
    # Breadth-first search for prime factors
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
            yield i
        i += 1
    if n > 1:
        yield n

# Test cases
for n in [13195, 2048, 91]:  # Includes edge case: a prime
    assert max(largest_prime_factor(n), key=lambda x: n // x) == n // max(n // 2, 1)
```

This code employs a breadth-first search (BFS) to traverse and yield prime factors. It then computes the largest prime factor by calculating the maximum of this factorized form. The key assertion ensures that the result handles the edge case of n being prime by not dividing n more than necessary.
