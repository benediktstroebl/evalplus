```python
def largest_prime_factor(n):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n."""
    # Check for largest factor first
    largest = n // 2
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            largest = i
    return largest
```

This approach is efficient and works well for larger integers `n`. It starts by checking the largest potential factor, which is `n // 2`. It then iterates through potential factors in increasing odd numbers, skipping any multiples of 2 along the way. This is because advanced divisibility rules state that if a number `n` is not divisible by 2, then `n` is not divisible by any odd number larger than `√n`. Thus, it efficiently finds the largest prime factor. 

To further elaborate on the logic, here's a breakdown of the code:
- The line `largest = n // 2` assigns the floor division result to `largest`. This is the largest possible factor of `n`, which is half of its value.
- The loop `for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2)` iterates through a sequence of numbers starting from 3 up to the square root of `n` (incremented by 2 each time). This is because all prime factors of `n` will be odd and less than `√n`.
- During each iteration, it checks if `n%i` is zero. This determines if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, then `i` is a factor of `n`, and because it's larger than the current `largest` value, `largest` gets updated to this new value.

Overall, this efficient approach significantly reduces the number of divisors to check compared to a brute force approach, resulting in significantly improved performance, especially for larger `n`. 

Please note that the `int(n**0.5) + 1` value in the loop is the next odd number after the square root of `n`. This can be proven using the Euclidean algorithm: if `a` and `b` are integers with a greatest common divisor of `x`, then `x = gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b)`. Now apply this recursively: `x = gcd(a, a%x) = gcd(a%x, x)`. Repeating this process shows that `x` is the GCD of `a` and `x`. This property is often used in factoring algorithms, and specifically what this code uses to efficiently find the largest prime factor. 

The approach assumes that `n` is not prime itself, as the algorithm will not terminate for prime values `n`.
