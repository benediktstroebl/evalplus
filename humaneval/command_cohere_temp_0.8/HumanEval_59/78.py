```python
def largest_prime_factor(n):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime."""
    factor = n
    while factor % 2 == 0:
        factor //= 2
    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        while factor % i == 0:
            factor //= i
    if factor > 1:
        return factor
    else:
        return n
```
The function employs an optimized approach to find the largest prime factor. It repeatedly divides n by integers larger than 2 (excluding even numbers) until it's reduced to 1. The loop starts from 3 and iterates up to `sqrt(n)`. This is a typical method for finding the largest prime factor in an efficient manner. 
The tests will correctly verify the function's behavior against the problem statement. A few things to note: 
- I have included a `while` loop that checks for the potential odd number case at the beginning to cover the edge case mentioned in the comment. 
- I've changed the division operator to `//` to prevent floating-point division, ensuring that the factor is correctly calculated as an integer. 
- The loop starts from 3, and we only consider odd numbers for the iteration to efficiently filter out even numbers and primes, leaving only composite numbers. As a result, the loop skips odd prime numbers, which are already handled by the initial 'while' loop.  this optimized approach, we improve the time complexity and efficiently find the largest prime factor. 
To further enhance the function, one can consider the Moore's Voting Algorithm or Wheel Factorization, which are more advanced approaches to factorization. Nonetheless, the function is straightforward and effective for solving the problem.
