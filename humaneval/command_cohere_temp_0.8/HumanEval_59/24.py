```python
def largest_prime_factor(n):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n."""
    # Check for the largest even factor as the answer
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
    # If no even factor found, n must be a prime
    return n
```
The algorithm starts from the initial factor of 2 and moves up to the square root of `n` (inclusive). It checks whether `n` is divisible by each number. If it finds any even number that `n` divides, that number is returned as the largest prime factor. If no divisors are found up to the square root, then `n` must be a prime number itself, so it is returned as the largest prime factor. 

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(âˆšn), making it efficient for factoring large numbers.

The tests should look like this:
```python
# Tests
def test_largest_prime_factor():
    assert largest_prime_factor(13195) == 29
    assert largest_prime_factor(2048) == 2
    assert largest_prime_factor(219) == 31
    assert largest_prime_factor(9741) == 7
    assert largest_prime_factor(822) == 2
    assert largest_prime_factor(2093) == 9793  # This is just an example; 9793 is not a prime
``` 
The test suite contains several test cases to validate the function against different input numbers, including a special case where the input number (`2093`) is not a prime number but has `9793` as its largest prime factor.
