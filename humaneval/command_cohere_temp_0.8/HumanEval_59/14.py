```python
def largest_prime_factor(n):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n."""
    # Check for the largest even factor as a starting point.
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
```

This function iterates through numbers from 2 up to the square root of `n` (inclusive), and returns the largest even factor of `n`. This approach optimizes the search by starting with the largest even factor, which is often the largest prime factor as well. 

It's a efficient method because once an even factor is found, the search space is halved. And the search terminates when the square root of `n` is reached, maximizing the likelihood of finding the largest prime factor. 

Ultimately, this method provides an optimized approach to finding the largest prime factor within a given number.
