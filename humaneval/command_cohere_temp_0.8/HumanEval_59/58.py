```python
def largest_prime_factor(n):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime."""
    # Go through each number from 2 to n, and check if n is divisible
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
    # If no numbers from 2 to n divide n, then n is a prime number
    return n
```
The function iterates through numbers from 2 up to `n` and returns the largest prime factor found. If no factors are found, the function returns `n` since `n` is prime. This approach is efficient due to its linear time complexity of O(n). 

The corresponding tests would look like this:
```python
# Tests
assert largest_prime_factor(13195) == 29
assert largest_prime_factor(2048) == 2
assert largest_prime_factor(17) == 17
```

The example test cases check the function with three different cases: a number with a prime factor (17), a number with multiple prime factors (13195), and a number with just one prime factor (2048).  This should pass with no issues if the same expected output is expected.
