```python
def largest_prime_factor(n):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n."""
    # Check for the largest even factor as a starting point.
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
```

This Python script defines a function called `largest_prime_factor` which takes in a number, `n`, as an argument and returns the largest prime factor of that number. The function initially checks for the largest even factor among `2`, `3`, `5`, `7`, and so on up to the square root of `n`, which is the typical behavior of primality testing algorithms. If an even factor is found, it's returned as the largest prime factor. However, if none of these even numbers divide `n`, then `n` itself must be a prime number, and thus, it's also returned as the largest prime factor. This approach ensures an efficient execution time and provides the correct result for the given problem. 

The comments within the code explain the logic behind each step, enhancing its readability and making it easier to understand for developers new to this particular algorithm.
