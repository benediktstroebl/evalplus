```python
def largest_prime_factor(n):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n."""
    # Check for the largest even factor as a starting point.
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
```

This function iterates through numbers from 2 up to the square root of `n` (inclusive), and for each number, it checks if it's a divisor of `n`. If `i` is a divisor of `n` and `i` is also a prime number, it means `i` is the largest prime factor of `n`, so the function returns `i` right away. If none of the numbers are prime divisors, the loop will end without returning anything, but the largest even factor (which is not necessarily prime) is checked first to make the process more efficient. 

To validate the correctness of the implementation, it is recommended to conduct further tests using various input values, including cases with multiple prime factors and higher values for `n`.
