```python
def largest_prime_factor(n):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime."""
    # Handle the case of n being a power of 2, which has no digits after the decimal point
    if n == 2:
        return 2
    while n % 2 == 0:
        n //= 2
    # The following loop handles cases of n having digits after the decimal point
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        while n % i == 0:
            n //= i
    return n
```
The function largest_prime_factor handles the case when n is a power of 2 (which has no digits after the decimal point) by returning 2. The function then iterates through integers in an interval [3, √(n) + 1, 2], stopping at the middle of the interval if it happens to be an even number. It repeatedly divides n by each integer in this interval, which are all prime numbers, until n is no longer divisible. The largest remaining value of n is returned, which is the largest prime factor. 

To handle the special case of n being a power of 2, we can test if n is exactly 2 and return 2. Here's an updated version of the code:
```python
def largest_prime_factor(n):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime."""
    # Handle the case of n being a power of 2
    if n == 2:
        return 2
    while n % 2 == 0:
        n //= 2
    # The following loop handles cases of n having digits after the decimal point
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        while n % i == 0:
            n //= i
    return n
```
This update ensures that the function handles the special case of n being a power of 2, which has no digits after the decimal point, by returning 2.  This value is handled separately from the main loop where we iterate over integers in the interval [3, √(n) + 1, 2] and we divide n by each prime number in that interval until n is no longer divisible. 
Let's keep this updated version in the further discussions. 
For any positive integer n with more than one digit after the decimal point, its largest prime factor will be less than or equal to the square root of n, so there is no need to check factors greater than √n. 

Also, all prime factors of n greater than 2 will have odd index digits after the decimal point, so it is sufficient to try only odd numbers. 

An optimal algorithm based on this observation is: 
1. If n is a power of 2, return 2. 
2. Repeat for i = 3, 5, 7, ..., √n: 
    1. If n is divisible by i, return i. 
    2. If n is not divisible by i and i is a prime, return n. 

Following this algorithm, we can write the solution using python: 

```python
def largest_prime_factor(n): 
    if n == 2: 
        return 2 
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2): 
        if n % i == 0: 
            return i 
    return n 

``` 

The above code will return the largest prime factor of any positive integer input n, assuming that n is greater than one and not a prime number itself.  This function efficiently solves the problem and provides the
