This function returns the largest prime factor of the given number `n`. It assumes that `n` is greater than 1 and is not a prime itself. The process involves checking for the edge case where `n` is a power of 2, and then iterating through potential factors from 3 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is not divisible by any of these potential factors, it must be a prime larger than 2 and thus is returned. The tests provided for this function pass with this implementation.
