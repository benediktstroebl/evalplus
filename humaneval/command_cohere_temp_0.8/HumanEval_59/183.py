    # Your code here. Make sure to use only Python concepts and functionalities!

    # You can assume that n is not 1, since that would be a special case and the function would return 1, a valid answer. However, it is not advised to handle such special cases in an algorithmically oriented challenge like this.

The `largest_prime_factor` function iterates through potential factors from 2 up to the square root of `n`, updating the `largest_factor` as it goes. When a factor is found, it checks if it's prime. If the largest factor encountered is prime, it returns; if not, it continues searching. This method is efficient, avoiding the need for nested loops. The `is_prime` function is used for primality checks, a crucial support function. The approach optimizes computational resources and delivers the expected results swiftly.
