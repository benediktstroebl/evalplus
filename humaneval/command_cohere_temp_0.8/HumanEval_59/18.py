```python
def largest_prime_factor(n):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime."""
    def is_prime(m):
        """Check if m is a prime number."""
        if m <= 1:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(m**0.5) + 1):
            if m % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0 and is_prime(i):
            return i
    return n
```

The function employs a nested approach, with the `is_prime` function checking if a number is prime. The `largest_prime_factor` function iterates through numbers from 2 up to `n-1` to find the largest prime factor. It verifies if a number is divisible by `i` and that `i` is prime using the `is_prime` function. The largest prime factor is returned as the output once it has been identified. This approach ensures that the function identifies the largest prime factor within an acceptable time limit. 
The function is designed to handle scenarios where `n` is greater than 1, and not an prime number.
