```python
def largest_prime_factor(n):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime."""
    # Check for the edge case where n is a power of 2.
    if n >= 2 and ((n & (n - 1)) == 0):
        return 2
    # Script inspired by Python's built-in factorization.
    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
```

This script iterates through prime integers 3 and above up to the square root of `n`, incrementing by 2 each time due to Python's built-in factorization efficiency. It checks whether the number is divisible and returns the largest prime factor found. 

For example:
```python
largest_prime_factor(13195)
```
```
29
```

And similarly for 2048 as in the example in the prompt:
```python
largest_prime_factor(2048)
```
```
2
```
