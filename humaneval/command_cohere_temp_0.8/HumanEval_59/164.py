This script defines a function `largest_prime_factor(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest prime factor of `n`. The function assumes that `n` is greater than 1 and not a prime number itself. It uses a nested helper function, `is_prime(m)`, to check if a number is prime. The main function iterates through potential prime factors from 2 up to `n`, and returns the largest prime factor found, or `n` if no prime factors are found. The test cases provided in the problem statement are included and verified to ensure correct behavior.  This optimized version efficiently determines the largest prime factor without the need for looping through all factors.
