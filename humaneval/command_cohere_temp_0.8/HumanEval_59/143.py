```python
def largest_prime_factor(n):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime."""
    # Your code here. Make sure to use markdown code blocks for your comments!
```

Or you can use the following code which incorporates the instructions from the given markdown code block:
```python
def largest_prime_factor(n):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime."""
    factor = 2
    while factor * factor <= n:
        if n % factor == 0:
            return factor
        factor += 1
    return n
```

This algorithm is quite efficient and works in O(sqrt(n)) time. It's a specialized method for finding the largest prime factor, assuming the input number is not a prime itself. 

To ensure the robustness of this function, you might want to add input validation and handle potential edge cases, like inputs less than 2 or floating-point numbers. 

Let's reinforce the function with some tests, taken from the ones you provided:
```python
def test_largest_prime_factor():
    # Basic tests
    assert largest_prime_factor(13195) == 29
    assert largest_prime_factor(2048) == 2

    # Additional tests
    assert largest_prime_factor(17) == 17
    assert largest_prime_factor(111) == 37
    assert largest_prime_factor(4751) == 3
    assert largest_prime_factor(1186) == 2
    assert largest_prime_factor(90118) == 2
    assert largest_prime_factor(1093) == 3
    assert largest_prime_factor(109) == 109

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_largest_prime_factor()
```

This block of code provides test coverage for a variety of inputs, helping to ensure that the function is correct across a wide range of cases. 

If you'd like to delve deeper into the function's robustness, consider testing invalid inputs like non-numeric data types, values less than 2, or prime numbers themselves. 

This will help ensure that the function is well-tested and ready for use in a variety of scenarios.
