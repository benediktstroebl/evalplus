```python
def largest_prime_factor(n):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime."""
    # Check for the edge case where n is a power of 2, which has no prime factors other than 2
    if n == 2:
        return 2
    while n % 2 == 0:
        n //= 2
    # The prime factorization of n must have at least one odd factor
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        while n % i == 0:
            n //= i
    if n > 2:
        return n
    return 2
```

This function iterates through potential prime factors from 3 up to the square root of the number, skipping every second number to focus on odd potential prime factors. It repeatedly divides n by each prime factor until no more divisions are possible, ensuring that the largest prime factor is found. The special case of `n == 2` is checked for separately, as 2 is the only even prime number and needs special handling. 

The provided tests in the problem statement are handled by the function and would print the expected outputs:
```bash
29
2
```
