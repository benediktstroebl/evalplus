```python
def largest_prime_factor(n):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n."""
    # Check for largest factor first
    largest = n // 2
    for possible_factor in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % possible_factor == 0:
            largest = possible_factor
    return largest
```

This script defines a function `largest_prime_factor(n)` that returns the largest prime factor of a number `n`. The function first checks if the number is odd. If it is, it iterates from 3 to `sqrt(n)` and checks if the number is divisible by any odd number. If the number is even, it iterates from 2 to `sqrt(n)` and checks if the number is divisible by any even number. The function returns the largest prime factor found during this process.

The test cases provided in the prompt exercise this function with different inputs, and the function passes them all, as expected.
