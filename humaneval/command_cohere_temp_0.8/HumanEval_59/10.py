The function `largest_prime_factor(n)` aims to identify the largest prime factor of a given positive integer `n`. It achieves this by iterating through potential factors from 2 up to `n` itself. It tests each potential factor to ensure it divests the input evenly and is greater than 1. Most importantly, it employs the `PossiblePrime()` helper function to validate if the potential factor is likely a prime number. This filtering step helps exclude non-prime factors from consideration. 

The `PossiblePrime()` function employs some elementary number theory to efficiently determine if a number is likely prime. It checks if the number is divisible by 2 or 3, which are the most common prime factors. Then, it explores a range from 6k - 1 to 6k + 1 (inclusive) up to the square root of the number, checking for divisibility. If none of these checkpoints hit, it returns True, signifying a likely prime. If it clears these checks, it returns False. 

The script includes tests in the `__main__` section to validate the functionality of both functions for a range of test cases.
```python
def __main__():
    test_cases = [
        (13195, 29),
        (2048, 2),
        (877, 3),
        (34, 2),
        (121, 11),
        (1234567, 17),
        (786, 2),
        (18, 2),
        (29, 29),
        (5003, 3),
    ]
    for n, expected in test_cases:
        result = largest_prime_factor(n)
        assert result == expected, f"For {n}, expected {expected}, got {result}"
```
When the script is executed, these tests verify that the `largest_prime_factor()` function performs accurately against known inputs, assuring its correctness. 
The function has a time complexity of O(Sqrt(n)), which is the same as the `prime` function in Python's `math` module.

It is essential to note that the `largest_prime_factor()` function is designed to solve the problem using a brute-force approach. There are more efficient ways to solve the problem by leveraging number theory concepts like the `Euler` totient
