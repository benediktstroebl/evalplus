```python
def largest_prime_factor(n):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n."""
    # Check for the largest even factor as a starting point.
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
```

This Python script defines a function called `largest_prime_factor` which takes in a number `n` as input. The function is designed to find the largest prime factor of the input number `n`. It starts by iterating through factors from 2 up to the square root of `n`. It verifies if `n` is divisible by each number `(n % i == 0)` and if it is, it returns that factor `i` immediately, as it guarantees that this factor is prime. The loop is designed to end at `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`, which ensures that only whole numbers are considered for factors, and any potential factors beyond the square root are skipped. 

This approach efficiently identifies the largest prime factor because prime numbers larger than the square root of `n` would have corresponding smaller factors that should be identified first. 

The unit tests, assuming provided as part of the original problem statement, will ensure that the function correctly identifies the largest prime factor for various input numbers.
