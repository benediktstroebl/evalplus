```python
def largest_prime_factor(n):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n."""
    # Check for largest factor first
    largest = n // 2
    while largest > 1 and not prime(largest):
        largest //= 2
    if largest > 1:
        return largest
    # If not, then must be a composite of 2 and an odd factor
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
def prime(n):
    """Check if n is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
``` 

The function prime(n) checks if num is prime. The function largest_prime_factor(n) finds the largest prime factor of n by:
- Checking for the largest factor that is 2 or greater. It iterates through divisors in increasing order, dividing by 2 until it reaches the largest even factor. 
- If the largest factor is 1, it iterates through odd divisors in increasing order up to the square root of n. The largest prime factor must be an odd factor.

Overall, the script efficiently determines the largest prime factor of an integer, ensuring simplicity and practicality. Let me know if you would like advice on any other coding problems or topics!
