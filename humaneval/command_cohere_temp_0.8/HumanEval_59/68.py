This script incorporates a generator method, `largest_prime_factor(n)`, that iterates over all prime factors of `n` in ascending order. It begins with a breadth-first search (BFS) from `i = 2` up to `i * i <= n`, continuously yielding any factor found. Once a factor `i` is found, the loop will iterate through its multiples up to `n`, continuously dividing `n` by `i`.

Should `n` be a prime number larger than 2, the function will yield only the prime factor `n`.

The tests provided in the problem are handled by incorporating a `for` loop specifically structured to print each step in the prime factorization process. This makes the output more user-friendly for the given test cases, displaying the sequence of prime factors leading to the final result. 

This code efficiently delivers the largest prime factor and can adapt to handle diverse input. 

This solution is efficient and optimized, providing a clear way to determine the largest prime factor of a given number.
