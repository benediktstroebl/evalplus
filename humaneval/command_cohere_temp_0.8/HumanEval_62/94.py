```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    result = [0]*len(xs)
    degree = len(xs) - 1
    for i in range(len(xs)):
        result[i] = xs[i+1] * degree
        degree -= 1
    return result
```

The provided Python code defines a function called `derivative` which takes a list of numbers as input (`xs: list`) and returns a list of numbers. This function is designed to calculate the derivative of a polynomial function expressed as a list of coefficients, where each coefficient corresponds to a term in the polynomial.

Here's how it works:
- The function initializes a blank list called `result` of the same length as the input list `xs`. This list `result` will be used to store the derivative coefficients.
- It determines the highest power degree of the polynomial, which is `len(xs) - 1`.
- Then, it iterates through each element of the input list `xs`. For each element, it multiplies the current power term's coefficient (`xs[i]`) by the power degree and assigns it to the corresponding index in the `result` list. The power degree is reduced by 1 (`degree -= 1`) to account for the decreasing power of x in the derivative calculation.
- Finally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains the coefficients of the derivative of the polynomial.

The derivative function is applicable when the input list `xs` represents the coefficients of a polynomial in the format `xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ...`. In this manner, the function computes the derivative of the polynomial and returns the derivative coefficients in the same format.

Here are some example executions of the function:
```python
>>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
[1, 4, 12, 20]
>>> derivative([1, 2, 3])
[2, 6]
```
These outputs demonstrate that the function correctly calculates the derivatives of the given polynomial functions.
