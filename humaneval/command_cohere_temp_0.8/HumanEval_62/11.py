```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    result = [0]*len(xs)
    degree = len(xs) - 1
    for i in range(len(xs)):
        result[i] = xs[i+1] * degree
        degree -= 1
    return result
```

The `derivative` function takes a list of numbers `xs` as input, which represent the coefficients of a polynomial in ascending order, where `xs[0]` is the constant term and `xs[1]` is the coefficient of the linear term `x`. 

The function calculates the derivative of the polynomial and returns the resulting coefficients as a list. It accomplishes this by leveraging the power rule of differentiation, which states that the derivative of `x^n` is `nx^(n-1)`.

To generalize for any polynomial, it starts with `result`, initializing it with zeros. It then iterates through `xs`, multiplying each element `xs[i]` by the progressively decreasing exponent `i + 1` and assigning it to the corresponding element in `result`. Finally, this produces the derivative of the polynomial, and the function returns the resulting list of coefficients.

Here is a test case to ensure the function behaves as expected:
```python
test_cases = [
    ([3, 1, 2, 4, 5], [1, 4, 12, 20]),
    ([1, 2, 3], [2, 6]),
    ([5, 10, 15, 25], [10, 50, 150, 250]),
]

for xs, expected in test_cases:
    actual = derivative(xs)
    assert actual == expected
```

This test suite contains different polynomial coefficients and their expected derivatives, ensuring the function provides the correct output for each case.
