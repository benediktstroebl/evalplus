```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    """
    Return the derivative of the polynomial represented by the list of coefficients.
    """
    result = [0] * (len(xs) - 1)
    x = 0
    for i in range(len(xs) - 1):
        result[i] = xs[i + 1] * (x + 1) - xs[i] * x
        x += 1
    return result
```

The derivative of a polynomial P(x) = a_n * x^n + a_5 * x^5 + ... + a_1 * x + a_0 is given by:
P'(x) = n * a_n * x^(n - 1) + 5 * a_5 * x^(5 - 1) + ... + a_1 * x^(1 - 1) + a_0

Here's a test case to verify the correctness of the implementation:
```python
def test_derivative():
    # Test case from the problem statement
    assert derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]) == [1, 4, 12, 20]

    # Edge case: Input with only one coefficient
    assert derivative([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 6]

    # Negative test case
    incorrect_length_input = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        derivative(incorrect_length_input)

    # Negative test case
    wrong_type_input = "this is not a list"
    with pytest.raises(TypeError):
        derivative(wrong_type_input)

test_derivative()
```

This test suite verifies the functionality of the `derivative` function and checks for both correct and incorrect inputs.

To run the test cases, you can save the code into a file (e.g., `test.py`) and execute the file using Python:
```bash
python test.py
```

The test cases will be executed, and any assertions will be checked. If all assertions pass, it confirms that the code behaves as expected.
