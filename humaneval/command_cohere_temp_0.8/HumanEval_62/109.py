```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    """
    Return the derivative of the polynomial represented by the list of coefficients.
    """
    result = [0] * (len(xs) - 1)
    x = 0
    for i in range(len(xs) - 1):
        result[i] = xs[i + 1] * (x + 1) - xs[i]
        x += 1
    return result
```

The derivative of a polynomial P(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_1x + a_0 can be derived using the formula:
d/dx(P(x)) = a_n * (x^(n-1) + x^(n-2) + ... + 1) + a_{n-1} * (x^(n-2) + ... + 1) + ... + a_1 * 1

In the code above, we iterate through the list of coefficients xs, and calculate the derivative term for each term of the polynomial. The result list is pre-initialized with zeros and then populated with the calculated derivatives, effectively calculating d/dx(P(x)) for the polynomial represented by xs.
