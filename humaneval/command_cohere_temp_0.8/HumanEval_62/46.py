```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    """
    Compute the derivative of a polynomial represented by its coefficients.
    
    Args:
        xs (list): Coefficients of the polynomial, in the order: xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ...
    
    Returns:
        list: Derivative of the polynomial in the same form.
    """
    result = [0] * len(xs)
    x = 1
    for i in range(len(xs)):
        result[i] = xs[i] * x
        x *= 1 << i
    return result
```

The derivative is computed using the basic formula:
```
d/dx (xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ... + xs[n] * x^n) 
 = xs[0] * 1 << n | ds/dx(x^n) 
```

The latter expression can be computed recursively, introducing the recurrence relation:
```
ds/dx(x^n) = n * x^(n - 1)
```

This is implemented in the code by iterating over the indices and multiplying the coefficients by `1 << i`, the i-th power of x. 

**Note**: this derivative algorithm is designed to work with polynomials that have coefficients represented as numerical values, as in the problem statement. 
If you're working with symbolic math, using a library like SymPy would be more appropriate for differentiation. In that case, the resulting expression would not be a simple list of numbers, but rather a SymPy Symbol object.
