```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    """
    Return the derivative of the polynomial represented by the list of coefficients.
    """
    result = [0] * (len(xs) - 1)
    x = 0
    for i in range(len(xs) - 1):
        result[i] = xs[i + 1] * (x + 1) - xs[i]
        x += 1
    return result
```

The tests cases are:
```python
>>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
[1, 4, 12, 20]
>>> derivative([1, 2, 3])
[2, 6]
>>> derivative([-1, 1, 2, -3, 4])
[-2, 2, -6, 12]
>>> derivative([0, 0, 0, 0])
[0, 0, 0, 0]
