```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    result = [0] * (len(xs) + 1)
    result[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, len(xs)):
        result[i] = result[i - 1] * len(xs) + xs[i - 1] * (len(xs) - 1)
    return result
```

The derivative of a polynomial is given by:
```
(x^n)     => n * x^(n - 1)
(ax^n)    => a * n * x^(n - 1)
(ax^n + b) => a * n * x^(n - 1) + b * n^(1 - 1) * x^(n - 2)
.....
```

Here's a test case to verify the correctness of the implementation:
```python
def test_derivative():
    # Arrange
    polys = [
        [3, 1, 2, 4, 5],
        [1, 2, 3],
        [6, -3, 2, 4],
        [2, -5, 6, 8, 10]
    ]
    expected_results = [
        [1, 4, 12, 20],
        [2, 6],
        [6, 9, -6],
        [4, -10, 16, 20]
    ]

    # Act & Assert
    for poly, expected in zip(polys, expected_results):
        actual = derivative(poly)
        assert actual == expected
```

The test case verifies the correctness of the derivative calculation for different polynomials. You can copy and paste the code into a Python file and run it to see the results.
