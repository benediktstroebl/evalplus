```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    """ Returns the derivative of a polynomial represented by its coefficients. """
    num_terms = len(xs) - 1
    derivative_coef = [0] * num_terms
    for i in range(num_terms):
        derivative_coef[i] = xs[i + 1] * (i + 1)
    return derivative_coef
```

The derivative of a polynomial of form `xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + .....` 
can be computed as `d / dx( xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....)` 
= `xs[1] + 2 * xs[2] * x + 3 * xs[3] * x^2 + ...`

Thus, the coefficient of the i-th power of x in the derivative is `xs[i+1] * (i+1)`

The python script provides a function `derivative` that takes in a list `xs` representing the coefficients of a polynomial and returns the corresponding derivative coefficients.
