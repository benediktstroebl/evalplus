This Python script defines a function `derivative()` that takes a list of numbers as input, representing the coefficients of a polynomial, and returns the derivative of that polynomial. The function employs a loop to calculate the result, iterating through each term of the polynomial and utilizing the chain rule of differentiation to compute the derivative of each term. Subsequently, the derivative of the constant term is added to the result. 

The script passes the provided tests, demonstrating its correctness. It also includes a docstring that provides a concise explanation of the function's purpose, the input argument, and an example of its usage, aiding in understanding and utilization.
