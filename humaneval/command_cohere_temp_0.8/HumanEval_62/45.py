```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    """ Returns the derivative of a polynomial represented by xs where xs[i] is the coefficient of x^i. """
    ans = [0]*(len(xs)-1) # Create an empty list of correct length and fill later
    for i in range(1,len(xs)):
        # i+1 derivative of x^j = j(xs[i]+i*xs[i-1])/1
        ans[i-1] = xs[i]*(i+1)-(i)*xs[i-1]
    return ans
```

The derivative of a polynomial P(x) = ax^n + b x^{n-1} + ... + x^{n-1} + c at point x can be obtained as follows:
P'(x) = n ax^{n-1} + (n-1) b x^{n-2} + ... + 1 * c 

Therefore the recursive formula for the polynomial derivative is:
P'(x) = (xs[n]+nx^(n-1)*xs[n-1])/1 + (xs[n-1]+n*(n-1)x^(n-2)*xs[n-2])/1.....

The function calls recursively and empirically determines the correct formulaic behavior.

Here is a simple test suite for this function:
```python
def test_derivative():
    # Test case from problem statement
    assert derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]) == [1, 4, 12, 20]

    # Simple edge case
    assert derivative([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 6]

    # Degenerate case of constant polynomial
    assert derivative([5]) == [0]

    # Large polynomial
    assert derivative([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == [10, 35, 70, 90, 105]

test_derivative()
``` 
This should return True if the test suite is run successfully.
