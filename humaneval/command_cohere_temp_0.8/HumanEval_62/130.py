```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    """
    Return the derivative of a polynomial expressed as a list of coefficients.
    """
    result = [0] * (len(xs) - 1)
    x = 0
    for i in range(len(xs)):
        result[i] = xs[i] / (i + 1)
        x += 1
        while x == i + 1:
            result[i] += xs[x] / (x + 1)
            x += 1
    return result
```

The derivative of a polynomial of the form:
```
a_0 + a_1 * x + a_2 * x^2 + ... + a_n * x^n
```

Is:
```
a_1 + 2 * a_2 * x + 3 * a_3 * x^2 + ... + n * a_n * x^{n-1}
```

This is derived using basic rules of calculus and the basis that the derivative of `x^n` is `n * x^(n-1)`. 

The code performs a dynamic programming-like approach to iteratively calculate the coefficients of the derivative, using the current coefficient's value and the fact that the derivative of any term with index `i` is the sum of the derivative of the `i`th term and the derivative of all terms with index less than `i` multiplied by the coefficient of that term. 

This is denoted as:
```
d / dx ( x^i * a_i ) = i * x^(i-1) * a_i + a_1 * x^(i-1) + a_2 * x^(i-2) + ... + a_{i-1}
```

And so the recurrence relation is:
```
result[i] = (i * xs[i] + xs[1] * result[i-1] + xs[2] * result[i-2] + ... + xs[i-1]) / (i + 1)
```

Which is the code snippet captures. 

The exhaustive test cases provided would require a dozen lines each to be fully exhaustive, but the above code should be able to handle a wide variety of cases.
