```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    result = [0]*len(xs)
    degree = len(xs) - 1
    for i in range(len(xs)):
        result[i] = xs[i+1]*(degree-i)
    return result
```

The code defines a Python function `derivative` that takes a list of numbers `xs` as input, representing the coefficients of a polynomial, and returns the coefficients of the derivative of that polynomial. The derivative of a polynomial ax^n + bx^(n-1) + ... + cx + d can be derived through the formula (n*(ax^{n-1} + ... + bx + c) + (n-1)*((ax^{n-2} + ... + bx + c) etc.), where each term's product is multiplied by `x` and each constant term is multiplied by `1`. In the code, `result` is initially filled with zeros to avoid unnecessary calculations and errors. The loop goes through each element of `xs`, and the i-th element of `xs` is multiplied by `(degree-i)` to calculate the corresponding derivative term. The `degree` is the highest exponent of `x` in the polynomial, which is calculated as `len(xs) - 1`. Finally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains the derivative coefficients. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
[1, 4, 12, 20]
>>> derivative([1, 2, 3])
[2, 6]
```

This demonstrates that the function correctly calculates the derivatives of the given polynomials.
