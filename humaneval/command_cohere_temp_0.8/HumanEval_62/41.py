```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    """ Returns the derivative of a polynomial represented by coefficients xs. """
    n = len(xs) - 1
    derivative_xs = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        derivative_xs[i] = xs[i + 1] * (i + 1)
    return derivative_xs
```

The function uses an iterative approach to calculate the derivative of order n-1 which is achievable through the chain rule. It then loops through the coefficients of the polynomial and calculates the derivative of each term involving a variable 'x' to the power of i, where i is the current term's index. The computed result is then returned in the form of a list.

To test the function, let's use Python's built-in `unittest` module:
```python
import unittest

class TestPolynomialDerivative(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_derivative(self):
        self.assertEqual(derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]), [1, 4, 12, 20])

    def test_single_term(self):
        self.assertEqual(derivative([1, 2, 3]), [2, 6])

    def test_multiple_terms(self):
        self.assertEqual(derivative([6, -3, 2, 4, 5]), [6, -9, 14, 24])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This test suite includes three individual tests to validate the `derivative` function:
1. `test_derivative`: This tests the function against a known direct outcome.
2. `test_single_term`: This tests the function with a list of coefficients for a polynomial with only one term.
3. `test_multiple_terms`: This tests the function with a list of coefficients for a polynomial with multiple terms. 

The `unittest.main()` function is necessary to automatically run the tests.
