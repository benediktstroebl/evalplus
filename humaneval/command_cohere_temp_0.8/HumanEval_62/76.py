```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    result = [0] * (len(xs) + 1)
    result[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, len(xs)):
        result[i] = result[i - 1] * len(xs) + xs[i - 1] * (len(xs) - 1)
    return result
```

The derivative of a polynomial is given by:
```
(ax^{n-1} + ... + a x + a) / (x^n) 
```

We use a formula (which is a derivative of the sum formula) to find the derivative of a polynomial:
```
d/dx (a1 + a2 x + ... + an x^n-1) 
= a1 * (1 + n*x^{n-1} + ... + n * x) + a2 * (n * x^{n-2} + ... + 1) + ... + an * (1 + ... + n * x^{n-n})
```

We split the formula into two parts:
- Iterative terms with xs[i] * (len(xs) - 1)
- Summation terms with result[i - 1] * len(xs)

The summation part handles carry over from the previous iteration, which is implemented using a sliding sum.

The code has the following features:
1. It uses a built-in function list Comprehension to generate the result with the proper length and with an initial value of 0.
2. It uses a for loop to iterate over each element in the list and append the derivative to the result.
3. The derivative of each element is calculated using the previously computed result and added to the current element. 

The function then returns the resulting list, which is the derivative of the original polynomial.
