    Compute the derivative of a polynomial expressed as a list of coefficients.

    Args:
        xs (list): Coefficients of the polynomial in the form [3, 1, 2, 4, 5], where xs[0] is the constant term and xs[1:] are the terms with multiplying factors x, x^2, ..., x^n.

    Returns:
        list: The derivative of the polynomial in the same form.

This Python script defines a function `derivative` that takes a list of coefficients as input and returns the derivative of the corresponding polynomial. The function employs a loop to calculate the derivative for each term in the polynomial and initialize the result list with zeros. It then iterates through the list of coefficients, updating each result value by multiplying the current coefficient with the current value of `x`, which starts at 1 and incrementally increases by 1. Finally, the function returns the computed derivative as a list.
