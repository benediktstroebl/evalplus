```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    """ Returns the derivative of a polynomial encoded in a list of coefficients.

        Args:
            xs (list): List of integers, where xs[i] is the coefficient of x^i in the polynomial.

        Returns:
            list: A list of integers, where xs[i] is the coefficient of x^(i+1) of the derivative.
        """

    ans = [0]*len(xs)
    for i in range(len(xs)):
        temp = xs[i]
        for j in range(i):
            temp -= xs[j]*(i-j)
        ans[i] = temp
    return ans
```

This function uses a basic calculation to find the derivative of each coefficient of a polynomial and returns the result as a list in the same form. 

Here is a simple test suite to verify the functionality of the function:
```python
def test_derivative():
    # Test Case 1
    polynomial = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]
    expected_derivative = [1, 4, 12, 20]
    assert derivative(polynomial) == expected_derivative

    # Test Case 2
    polynomial = [1, 2, 3]
    expected_derivative = [2, 6]
    assert derivative(polynomial) == expected_derivative

    # Test Case 3
    polynomial = [10, 20, 30]
    expected_derivative = [20, 60]
    assert derivative(polynomial) == expected_derivative

test_derivative()
```

This test suite uses Python's `assert` statement to check if the output of the `derivative` function is equal to the expected output for three different test cases. 

Note, the test suite is basic and only checks for correct output length and numerical equality of each item in the list (instead of an equivalency assertion). For more complex functions or for parameterization, other frameworks such as `pytest` may be preferable. 

To run the test, simply execute the test function (`test_derivative()`) in your Python environment.
