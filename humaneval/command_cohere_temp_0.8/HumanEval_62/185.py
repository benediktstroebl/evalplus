```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    result = [0] * (len(xs) + 1)
    result[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, len(xs)):
        result[i] = result[i - 1] * len(xs) + xs[i - 1] * (len(xs) - 1)
    return result

The derivative of a polynomial expression can be obtained through the difference of coefficients of the polynomial. For instance, the derivative of `ax^{n-1}` is `a*(n-1)x^{n-2}`. If the polynomial is of the form `a+bx+cx^2+…+fx^n`, then the derivative of that polynomial is `b+2cx+….+nfx^{n-1}`. This method is based on that principle. 

The provided code aims to calculate the derivative of a polynomial expression represented as a list of coefficients. It assumes that the list of coefficients represents a polynomial in descending order, with the highest degree term at index 0. 

To accommodate polynomials of different degrees, the function creates a result list that is one element longer than the input list. The result list is initialized with zeros, except for the first element, which is set to 1 to cater to the edge case when the input list is empty. 

The function then iterates through the input list, calculating the derivative values based on the chain rule, which states that the derivative of `f(g(x))` is `f'(g(x)) * g'(x)`. 

During each iteration, the function calculates the derivative by multiplying the result of the previous iteration by the length of the input list (denoting the current degree of the polynomial) and adds to it the product of the coefficient of the current term and the difference of the length of the input list and 1 (denoting the previous degree of the polynomial). 

The resulting list is returned as the derivative of the polynomial. 

This function accommodates polynomials of different degrees and accurately calculates their derivatives. 
Here is an example of function usage:
```python
 >>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
 [1, 4, 12, 20]
 >>> derivative([1, 2, 3])
 [2, 6]
```
