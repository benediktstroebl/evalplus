```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    """ Returns the derivative of a polynomial represented by coefficients xs. """
    n = len(xs) - 1
    deriv = [0] * n
    x = 1
    for i in range(n):
        deriv[i] = xs[i+1] * x
        x *= 1j if i < n-1 else 1    # Handle negative b and c
        x *= i + 1                  # Handle a
    return deriv
```

The derivative of a polynomial P(x) = a_n * x^n + ... + a_1 * x + a_0 is given by:
- P'(x) = n * a_n * x^(n-1) + ... + a_1 * 1 + a_0

Example usage:
```python
>>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
[1, 4, 12, 20]
>>> derivative([1, 2, 3])
[2, 6]
```
