```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    """ Returns the derivative of a polynomial represented by its coefficients xs. """
    n = len(xs) - 1
    result = [0] * n
    x = 1
    for i in range(n):
        result[i] = xs[i+1] * x
        x *= 1
        x += 1
    return result
```

The test cases correspond to the given ones and include edge cases like an empty list and a list of one element, which should raise an error. 

```python
test_cases = [
    ([3, 1, 2, 4, 5], [1, 4, 12, 20]),
    ([1, 2, 3], [2, 6]),
    ([], ValueError),
    (None, TypeError),
    ([], ValueError),
    ([1], TypeError),
    ([1, 2], TypeError),
    ([1, 2, 3, 4], TypeError),
]

for args, expected in test_cases:
    assert derivative(args) == expected
```

You can add these test cases and run the script in a Python environment to verify the correctness of the derivative function.
