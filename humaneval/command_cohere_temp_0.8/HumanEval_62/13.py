The function `derivative` uses a list comprehensions to calculate the result, with each element of the result list being the derivative of the corresponding term in the input list. 

The provided tests ensure that the function behaves correctly for several different input lists.  Any list of numbers will appropriately determine the corresponding polynomial derivative and produce a derivative list as output.  Feel free to add more tests to cover other cases.  This is a useful approach to ensure function correctness for various scenarios.
