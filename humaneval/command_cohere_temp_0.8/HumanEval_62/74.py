```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    """
    Compute the derivative of a polynomial expressed as a list of coefficients.

    Args:
        xs (list): Coefficients of the polynomial in the form [x^0, x^1, x^2, ...].

    Returns:
        list: Derivative of the polynomial in the same form.
    """
    result = [0] * len(xs)
    dx = 1
    for i in range(len(xs)):
        result[i] = xs[i] * dx
        dx += 1
    return result
```

The test cases provided are:
```python
>>> test_cases = [
    ([3, 1, 2, 4, 5], [1, 4, 12, 20]),
    ([1, 2, 3], [2, 6]),
]

>>> for case in test_cases:
...     assert derivative(case[0]) == case[1]
```

The function takes a list of coefficients as input and returns the corresponding derivatives of the polynomial. It employs a loop to calculate the derivative of each term in the polynomial and manually compute the slope for each term by correctly handling the index increment.
