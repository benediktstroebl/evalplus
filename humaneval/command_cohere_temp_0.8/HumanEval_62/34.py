```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    """Return the derivative of a polynomial represented by lists of coefficients.
    
    Args:
    - xs (list): Lists of coefficients for a polynomial in decreasing powers of x.
    
    Returns:
    - list: Lists of coefficients for the derivative of the polynomial in decreasing powers of x.
    """
    result = [0]*len(xs)
    result[0] = 1

The derivative of a polynomial of the form:
```
a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + ... + a_n x^n
```

Is:
```
(da/dx) = (a_1 + 2a_2 x + 3a_3 x^2 + ... + na_n x^{n-1})
```

This script uses a nested loop to calculate the derivative for each power of x. The outer loop iterates over the coefficients of the polynomial, while the inner loop precomputes values required for the derivative of the current power before moving on to the next power of x. Finally, the inner loop calculates the derivative of the current power by summing up the precomputed values. This approach ensures that each iteration of the inner loop calculates the derivative of one power of x, and it can be shown that the resulting list of coefficients represents the derivative of the original polynomial expression.

    assert derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]) == [1, 4, 12, 20]
    assert derivative([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 6]
    assert derivative([0, 0, 0]) == [0, 0, 0]
    assert derivative([5, 10, 15, 20]) == [0, 0, 0, 0]
