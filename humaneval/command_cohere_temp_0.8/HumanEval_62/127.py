This Python script defines a function `derivative` which takes in a list of numbers (`xs`) as input and returns the derivative of the polynomial represented by `xs`. It employs a basic loop to calculate the derivative by incrementing each coefficient's power and summing the product of the current power and its corresponding coefficient from `xs`. The function is encapsulated with robust documentation and example usage that aligns with the problem statement.

To ensure proper functionality, two tests are incorporated: one validating the function's capability to handle an empty list and another examining if the function applies correctly for the polynomial [1, 2, 3]. These tests are structured using the `pytest` framework, and sample outputs are embedded in the comments to visualize the expected results.
