```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    """Return the derivative of a polynomial represented by coefficients xs."""
    n = len(xs) - 1
    derivative_coef = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        derivative_coef[i] = xs[i + 1] * (i + 1)
    return derivative_coef
```

The function iterates through the coefficients of the polynomial, correctly calculating the derivative terms, and returns the list of derivative coefficients.

You can test this function by calling it with a list of polynomial coefficients as an argument and comparing the output with the expected correct derivatives, as shown in the problem statement. 
For example:
```python
>>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
[1, 4, 12, 20]
>>> derivative([1, 2, 3])
[2, 6]
```

This will help ensure that the function behaves as expected, providing the correct derivatives for various polynomial configurations. 
If the output doesn't match the expected correct derivatives, it likely indicates a problem in the function's implementation.
