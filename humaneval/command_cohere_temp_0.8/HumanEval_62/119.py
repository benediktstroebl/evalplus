```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    """ Returns the derivative of a polynomial given its coefficients. """
    result = [0] * (len(xs) + 1)
    result[0] = 1
    for i in range(len(xs)):
        result[i+1] = result[i] * len(xs) - xs[i] * result[i]
    return result
```

The following tests are included to verify the correct behavior of the function:
```python
def test_derivative():
    assert derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]) == [1, 4, 12, 20]
    assert derivative([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 6]
    assert derivative([-1, 2, -3, 4]) == [-2, -6, 12]
    assert derivative([0, 0, 0, 0]) == [0, 0, 0, 0]
    assert derivative([1]) == [0]
    assert derivative([]) == []
```

You can use the test_derivative function to confirm the polynomial derivative for various input lists. 
To run the individual tests, you can execute the following commands:
```python
test_derivative()
```

This will run all the tests sequentially. 

To run the tests in parallel for improved performance, you can utilize this command:
```python
import concurrent.futures
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    executor.map(test_derivative, range(5))
``` 

This command executes five tests using a thread pool. 

Ensure the output of each test is `True` to confirm the proper functionality of the `derivative` function.
