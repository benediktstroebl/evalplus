```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    """ Returns the derivative of a polynomial expressed in list form.
    
    Args:
        xs (list): Coefficients of the polynomial, where xs[0] is the constant term and xs[1:] are the terms with multiplied by the variable x^1, x^2, ... etc. 
    
    Example:
        >>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
        [1, 4, 12, 20]
    """
    result = [0] * (len(xs) - 1)
    for i in range(1, len(xs)):
        result[i - 1] = xs[i] * i
    return result
```

The derivative of a polynomial P(x) = a_n * x^n + a_{n-1} * x^{n-1} + ... + a_1 * x + a_0 is given by:
P'(x) = n * a_n * x^(n - 1) + (n - 1) * a_{n-1} * x^(n - 2) + ... + 1 * a_1 * x^0 + 0 * a_0

Based on this, the function determines the derivative of the polynomial by multiplying each element in the list by its index and then building the result list accordingly. It returns a list of length n-1, where n is the degree of the polynomial. 

The function also has documentation explaining its purpose and behavior as well as examples showing its usage and expected output. 

You can test the function using the following:
```python
test_cases = [
    ([3, 1, 2, 4, 5], [1, 4, 12, 20]),
    ([1, 2, 3], [2, 6]),
]

for xs, expected in test_cases:
    result = derivative(xs)
    assert result == expected
```

This test suite demonstrates the correct operation of the `derivative` function for a couple of test cases. 

If you plan to incorporate this into a more extensive project, you may consider incorporating additional testing methodologies, optimizing the function, and adding error handling as part of a more comprehensive software engineering approach.
