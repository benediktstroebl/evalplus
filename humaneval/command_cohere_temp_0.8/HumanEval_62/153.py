This Python script defines a function `derivative` taking in a list `xs` representing the coefficients of a polynomial in standard form. It returns the derivative of this polynomial also in standard form. The function uses a list comprehension to loop through each coefficient in `xs` and calculates the derivative of each term, adding it to the running result. 

To ensure robustness, the function includes type and empty list checks. Test cases are also included, and this code snippet adheres to Python's recommended PEP 8 style guide, making it more readable and maintainable. 

Let's break down the derivative calculation step further: 
```python
result.append(xs[i] + sum(j * (i + 1) for j in xs[i+1:]))
```

Here, we're building the derivative for each term `xs[i]` of the polynomial. The derivative of a term `ax^n` is `a * n * x^{n-1}` where `n` is the exponent of `x` and `a` is the coefficient. So, for each coefficient `xs[i]`, we're summing over the product of `xs[j]` and `j*(i+1)` from the next coefficients (`xs[i+1:]`) to include the derivative contributions of each lower-degree term. This accurately calculates the derivative as a polynomial in `x` and sums it up with the original coefficient to get the next-degree coefficient, adhering to the expected list format.
