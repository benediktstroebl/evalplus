```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    """Return the derivative of a polynomial represented by coefficients xs."""
    result = [0] * (len(xs) - 1)
    for i in range(len(xs) - 1):
        result[i] = xs[i + 1] * (i + 1)
    return result
```

The derivative of a polynomial P(x) = a_n * x^n + a_(n-1) * x^(n-1) + ... + a_1 * x + a_0 is given by:
P'(x) = n * a_n * x^(n - 1) + (n - 1) * a_(n-1) * x^(n - 2) + ... + 1 * a_1 * x + 0 * a_0

For example, the derivative of 3 * x^2 + 2 * x + 1 is:
3 * x^2 + 2 * x + 0

The derivative of x^2 + 3 * x + 2 is:
2 * x + 3

The function loops through the coefficients of the polynomial, starting from index 1 (since the constant term is handled separately), and calculates the derivative contribution from each term using the formula above. The result is accumulated in the `result` list and returned. 

Here is a test suite to ensure the function behaves as expected:
```python
def test_derivative():
    # Test case from problem statement
    assert derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]) == [1, 4, 12, 20]

    # Single term (constant)
    assert derivative([1]) == [0]

    # Test case with multiple terms
    assert derivative([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 6]

    # Test case with no terms
    assert derivative([]) == []

    # Edge case: 1 coefficient
    assert derivative([5]) == [0, 5]

    # Edge case: 2 coefficients
    assert derivatives([2, 4]) == [0, 2, 4]

    # Large polynomial
    n = 50
    xs = [1] + [0] * (n - 1) + [1]
    assert derivative(xs)[:n] == [0] + list(range(1, n + 1))

test_derivative()
```
