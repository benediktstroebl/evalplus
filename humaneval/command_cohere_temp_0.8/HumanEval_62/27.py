The derivative of a polynomial can be derived through the sum and product rules of differentiation. Here's a brief overview:
- Sum Rule: When you have two terms multiplied by different powers of `x`, say `a_n*x^n` and `a_m*x^m`, their derivative is derived separately and then summed up.
- Product Rule: When you multiply two terms together, say `a_n*x^n` and `a_m*x^m`, their derivative is the product of the derivatives of the individual terms, i.e., `a_n*x^n * a_m*m^n + a_m*x^m * a_n*n^m`.

The provided code calculates the derivative of a polynomial expression using a loop to iterate through the coefficients and applying these rules. It then builds a list of derivatives, initially filled with zeros, and updates it with the calculated values. The result is returned as a list of coefficients of the derivative. 

Here is an example of the result of the derivative function when applied to a polynomial:
```python
>>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
[1, 4, 12, 20]
```

And here is an example of the function with a polynomial with fewer terms:
```python
>>> derivative([1, 2, 3])
[2, 6]
```

This function calls the derivative function with the provided list of coefficients and returns the computed derivative. The function also has comments that explain the steps involved in the computation of the derivative, providing clear guidance on the methodology used.
