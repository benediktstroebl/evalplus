```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    """Return the derivative of a polynomial represented by coefficients xs."""
    n = len(xs) - 1
    result = [0] * n
    x = 1
    for i in range(n):
        result[i] = xs[i+1] * x
        x *= 1j if i < n-1 else 1    # Handle negative exponents
    return result
```

The derivative of a polynomial p(x) = a_n * x^n + a_{n-1} * x^{n-1} + ... + a_1 * x + a_0 is given by:
p'(x) = n * a_n * x^(n-1) + (n-1) * a_{n-1} * x^(n-2) + ... + 1 * a_1 * x + 0 * a_0

The above Python script directly calculates the coefficients of the derivative polynomial, using complex numbers for handling negative exponents due to the chain rule. It returns the derivative polynomial in the form [a_n * x^n + a_{n-1} * x^{n-1} + ... + a_1 * x + a_0].

Note that this assumes that the input polynomial is a valid one, i.e., the degree of the polynomial is consistent with the number of coefficients provided. Further enhancements could involve validation and handling of the base case (degree 0 polynomial).
