The derivative of a polynomial is derived element-wise with respect to the variable `x`. To achieve this, we iterate over each element `xs[i]`, and multiply it by `x`, then update `x` to `x + 1`. 

Here's a step-by-step:
1. `result` is initially populated with zeros corresponding to the length of `xs` (the number of coefficients).
2. For each coefficient (`xs[i]`), we multiply it by `x`, and accumulate this into the respective position in `result`. 
3. Before each iteration, we update `x` to `x + 1`, thereby moving to the next derivative level.

This approach efficiently computes the derivative and stores it in the `result` list. 

This function depends on the coefficient list `xs` and returns the derivative of the polynomial as a list. It adheres to the function signature specified in the prompt and outputs values consistent with the provided examples. 

Here is some example output:
```
python> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
[1, 4, 12, 20]
python> derivative([1, 2, 3])
[2, 6]
