```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    """ Returns the derivative of a polynomial represented by its coefficients. """
    num_terms = len(xs) - 1
    result = [0] * num_terms
    x = 1

```

The script uses a straightforward approach to calculate the derivative of a polynomial expression. It iterates through the coefficients while gradually increasing the `x` term. The inner loop multiplies `x` by 2 for each iteration, and the derivative component is computed by multiplying the current `x` value with the corresponding coefficient. This process repeats until all relevant coefficients are computed and stored in the `result` list. 

To accommodate polynomials with different term counts, the function employs a list comprehension to initialize the `result` list with zeros, utilizing the term count minus 1 to determine the appropriate length.
