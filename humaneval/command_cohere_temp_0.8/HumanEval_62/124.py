```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    """Return the derivative of a polynomial represented by coefficients xs."""
    result = [0] * (len(xs) - 1)
    for i in range(len(xs) - 1):
        result[i] = xs[i + 1] * (i + 1)
    return result
```

The derivative of a polynomial P(x) = xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ... is given by derivative formulas for each term involving xs[1] * (1x + 1). For example, the derivative of `xs[0]` is 0, and the derivative of `xs[1]*x` is `xs[1]` as `1 * 1 = 1`. The script loops through each element of the input list `xs` and calculates the derivative accordingly, using `(i+1)` as the power of `x` in the derivative formula. It stores the resulting derivative coefficients in the `result` list and returns it. 

This accurately solves the problem of finding the derivative of a polynomial formulated as a list of its coefficients.  It acts as a basic demonstration of the power and utility of Python for numerical computation and mathematical analysis.
