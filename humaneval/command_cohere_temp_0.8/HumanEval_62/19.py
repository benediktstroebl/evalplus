```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    result = [0]*len(xs)
    degree = len(xs) - 1
    for i in range(len(xs)):
        result[i] = xs[i+1]*degree
        degree -= 1
    return result
```
The `derivative` function takes a list of numbers `xs` as input, which represents the coefficients of a polynomial in standard form: `xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ...`.

The function computes the derivative of this polynomial and returns the derivative coefficients in the same form. It does this by applying the power rule of differentiation, where the derivative of `x^n` is `n*x^(n-1)`.

The `for` loop starts from index 1 (since `xs[0]` is a constant) and calculates the derivative of each term `xs[i]` by multiplying the coefficient of the current term `xs[i+1]` with the current degree of the polynomial `degree`, and increments `degree` by `-1` to account for the reduction in the power of `x` in the next iteration. The `result` list is initialized with `0` values of the same length as `xs` to store the derivative coefficients.

Here's an example of using the `derivative` function with a sample input polynomial coefficient list:
```python
>>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
[1, 4, 12, 20]
```
This output corresponds to the derivative polynomial coefficient representation: `1*x + 4*x^1 + 12*x^2 + 20*x^3`. 

When an input polynomial with a different number of coefficients is provided, the `derivative` function still returns a list of equal length populated with `0` values. For example:
```python
>>> derivative([1, 2, 3])
[2, 6]
```
This output represents the derivative of the polynomial `1*x + 2*x^1 + 3*x^2`, which has two coefficients.
