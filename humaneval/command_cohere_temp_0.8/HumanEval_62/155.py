The derivative of a polynomial can be derived through the sum and product rules of differentiation. The sample code provided defines a function that calculates the derivative of a polynomial expression with respect to x, represented as a list of coefficients. It initializes an empty result list and places the derivative of the constant term (xs[0]) as the first element in the result list. Following this, the function iterates through the list of coefficients, calculating the derivative of each term by adding the previous result multiplied by two, and the current coefficient. This builds the derivative sequence correctly. The function returns the result list, representing the polynomial's derivative as expected.
