The derivative of a polynomial is given by:
```
(ax^n) => (anx^(n-1))
```

Where 'a' is the coefficient of the polynomial for the term 'x^n'.

This equation is used to calculate the derivative for each coefficient in the provided list 'xs'. To avoid overflow issues when multiplying by 'x', we scale it by 1000000000 in each iteration. 

The loop goes through each element in the list 'xs' and multiplies the corresponding derivative term with the scaled value of 'x', storing it in the result list. 

The resulting list is then returned, which contains the derivative of the polynomial. 

This approach ensures that the function follows the specified problem statement and corresponds to the available test cases.
