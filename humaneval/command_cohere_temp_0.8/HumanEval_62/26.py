```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    """ Returns the derivative of a polynomial represented by its coefficients. """
    ans = [0] * (len(xs) - 1)
    mult = 1
    for i in range(1, len(xs)):
        ans[i - 1] = mult * (xs[i] - xs[i - 1])
        mult += xs[i]
    return ans
```

The derivative of a polynomial P(x) = a_n * x^n + a_(n-1) * x^(n-1) + ... + a_1 * x + a_0 is given by:
P'(x) = n * (a_n * x^(n - 1) + a_(n-1) * x^(n - 2) + ...) + (a_1 + a_0)

We start with an empty array ans and keep adding values to it with appropriate multiplication values 'mult'.

The tests are also included alongside the function for a comprehensive solution. 
```python
def test_derivative():
    assert derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]) == [1, 4, 12, 20]
    assert derivative([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 6]
    assert derivative([5, -10, 2, 4]) == [-10, -48]
    assert derivative([0, 0, 0]) == [0, 0, 0]
    assert derivative([1]) == [0]
    assert derivative([]) == []
```  Ensure you run the tests by typing `test_derivative()` in your Python interpreter.

You can use this code snippet as a starting point and customize it according to your needs. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions. Depending on what other functionalities you'd like to test or features you'd like to add, I can provide more guidance or additional code!
