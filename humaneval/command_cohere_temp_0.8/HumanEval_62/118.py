```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    """ Returns the derivative of a polynomial represented by its coefficients. """
    result = [0] * (len(xs) - 1)
    x = 1
    for i in range(len(xs)):
        result[i] = xs[i] * x
        x *= 1
    return result
```

The test cases are provided in the form of interactive prompts (`>>>) that allow you to evaluate the function manually. You can use these to validate the correctness of the implementation. 

If you prefer to have automated test coverage, test files can be written to accompany the function and ensure its accuracy in various scenarios. 

Let me know if you'd like to format the code with proper testing methodology!
