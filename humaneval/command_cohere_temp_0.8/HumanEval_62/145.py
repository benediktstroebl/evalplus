```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    """ Returns the derivative of a polynomial whos coefficients are represented by xs."""
    result = [0] * (len(xs) - 1)
    for i in range(len(xs) - 1):
        result[i] = xs[i + 1] * (i + 1)
    return result
```

This Python script defines a function `derivative` taking in one argument `xs`, which is a list representing the coefficients of a polynomial, and returns the list of its derivatives. It is a required argument, and its length index ranges from `0` to `N-1` where `N` is the length of the input list `xs`. It also provides a Markdown description of its purpose and a summary of its behavior through the triple-quoted string starting with `>>>`. 

Here is an example function call:
```python
derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
```

And here is the corresponding output:
```bash
[1, 4, 12, 20]
```

And another example call:
```python
derivative([1, 2, 3])
```

The output for this call is:
```bash
[2, 6]
```

This Python script solves the problem and passes the tests because it computes the derivative of the polynomial defined by `xs` and returns a list of its coefficients.  It is encapsulated, operative, and conducive to commodious repast, making it more readily understood and utilized by individuals.
