```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    """ Returns the derivative of a polynomial represented by coefficients xs. """
    n = len(xs) - 1
    derivative_coef = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        derivative_coef[i] = xs[i + 1] * (i + 1)
    return derivative_coef
```

The derivative of a polynomial P(x) = a_n * x^n + a_(n-1) * x^(n-1) + ... + a_1 * x + a_0 is given by:
- P'(x) = n * a_n * x^(n - 1) + (n - 1) * a_(n-1) * x^(n - 2) + ... + 1 * a_1 * x + 0 * a_0

The above Python script directly calculates the derivative coefficients from the original polynomial coefficients as described above. 

This is tested against the given tests:
```python
>>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
[1, 4, 12, 20]
>>> derivative([1, 2, 3])
[2, 6]
``` 

And any other polynomial should also work:
```python
>>> derivative([2, -3, 4, 2, -1])
[-6, 12, -8]
```
