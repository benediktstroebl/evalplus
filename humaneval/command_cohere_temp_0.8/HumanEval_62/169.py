This Python script defines a function `derivative` taking in a list (`xs`) as input and returning a list, which represents the derivative of a polynomial. The function takes in a list `xs` containing the coefficients of the polynomial, with `xs[0]` being the constant term and `xs[1:]` being the variable terms with powers mapped to their index. Using a loop, the function calculates the derivative of each variable term and returns a list of these derivatives, with each value corresponding to the variable term's index raised to the power of 1 less than its power in the input list. Test cases are also provided within the function to ensure its correctness against known outputs.  This solution is solely based on python and doesn't rely on any external libraries. 
The markdown code block above can be copied and pasted directly into a Python script or notebook cell for immediate use.
