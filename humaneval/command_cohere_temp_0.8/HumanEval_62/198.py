```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    result = [0] * (len(xs) + 1)
    result[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, len(xs)):
        result[i] = result[i - 1] * len(xs) + xs[i - 1] * (len(xs) - 1)
    return result
```

The derivative of a polynomial is given by:
```
(x^n) = n * x^(n-1)
```

Where `n` is the power of `x` and the coefficient of the polynomial. Therefore, the derivative of a constant polynomial is `0`.

This Python script defines a function `derivative` that takes a list `xs` representing the coefficients of a polynomial in descending order and returns the derivative as a list. It uses a formula to calculate the derivative of each term based on its position in the polynomial and combines this with the coefficient of that term to calculate the correct value. This is done iteratively and the initialization of `result[0] = 1` contributes the linear term of the polynomial, which is `1x^0 = 1`.

Here is a test case that verifies the correctness of the function:
```python
def test_derivative():
    assert derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]) == [1, 4, 12, 20]
    assert derivative([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 6]
    assert derivative([5, 5, 5, 5]) == [0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Assuming the markdown code block is added appropriately, running these tests will ensure the correctness of the function implementation.
