```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    result = [0] * (len(xs) + 1)
    result[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, len(xs)):
        result[i] = result[i - 1] * len(xs) + xs[i - 1] * (len(xs) - 1)
    return result
```

The derivative of a polynomial expression can be obtained using the power rule and then adjusting for the coefficient. For example, the derivative of $x^n$ is $n\cdot x^{n-1}$. This script uses a loop to calculate the derivative of the polynomial and returns the result as a list. The initial value of the result list is set to accommodate the final coefficient of the derivative, which is handled correctly when using multiplication to calculate the coefficients.
