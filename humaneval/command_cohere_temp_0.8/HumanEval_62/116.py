```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    result = [0] * (len(xs) + 1)
    result[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, len(xs)):
        result[i] = result[i - 1] * len(xs) + xs[i - 1] * (len(xs) - 1)
    return result
```

The following test cases illustrate how the function can be called to verify its behavior:
```python
def test_derivative():
    assert derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]) == [1, 4, 12, 20]
    assert derivative([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 6]
    assert derivative([-2, 0, -4, 2, 0, -6, 4, -2, 6, 0]) == [-2, -8, -36, -56, -16, -84, 68, -44, -140, -48]
```

This script defines a function `derivative` which accepts a list `xs` as input, where each element in the list represents the coefficient of the corresponding term in the polynomial. The function then calculates the derivative of this polynomial and returns the coefficients of the derivative in the same format. 

The derivative is calculated using the formula for the derivative of a polynomial, which states that for a polynomial of degree n, the n-th derivative is given by:
```
(x^(n-1)) * (n!) / ((x^(n-1)-1)!),
```
where x is the independent variable of the polynomial and n is the degree of the polynomial. 

The script then returns the coefficients of the derivative polynomial, where each coefficient represents the derivative of the corresponding term in the original polynomial. 

The `test_derivative` function provides test cases to validate the correctness of the `derivative` function. You can use these test cases to check the behavior of the `derivative` function for different polynomial coefficients.
