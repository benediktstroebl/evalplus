```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    """ Returns the derivative of a polynomial expressed in its coefficients. """
    num_terms = len(xs) - 1
    derivative_coef = [0] * num_terms
    for i in range(num_terms):
        derivative_coef[i] = xs[i+1] * (i + 1)
    return derivative_coef
```

The function uses an efficient closed-form expression to calculate the derivative of each term in the polynomial and then returns the list of derivative coefficients. 

You can verify the function's behavior by checking the test cases:
```python
test_cases = [
    ([3, 1, 2, 4, 5], [1, 4, 12, 20]),
    ([1, 2, 3], [2, 6]),
]

for coefs, expected in test_cases:
    assert derivative(coefs) == expected
```

This block executes tests asserting the function behavior against expected outputs. 

I hope this solution suits your needs. If you have any more questions, please don't hesitate to ask!
