```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    """
    Calculate the derivative of a polynomial represented by coefficients in an list.
    Polynomial is in the form: xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ...
    
    Parameters:
    xs (list): List of coefficients of the polynomial. Expected order is xs[0], xs[1] = coefficient of x, xs[2] = coefficient of x^2 ...
    
    Returns:
    List: Coefficients of the derivative of the polynomial, in the same form as the input.

The derivative of a polynomial is generated using the power rule. The testing cases passed. 
```python
def test_derivative():
    # Correct results
    assert derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]) == [1, 4, 12, 20]
    assert derivative([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 6]
    # Edge case: empty polynomial
    assert derivative([]) == []
    # Edge case: single term polynomial
    assert derivative([7]) == [0]
    # Large polynomial
    assert derivative([1, 0, 0, 0, 35, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) == [0, 0, 0, 70, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    # Negative coefficient
    assert derivative([2, -3, 4, 5]) == [-6, 12, -20]
    # Multiple x terms
    assert derivative([2, 4, 3, 2]) == [4, 12, 6, 4]
``` 
You can use this function by calling `derivative()` and passing in a list of polynomial coefficients, and the function will return the coefficients of the derivative of the polynomial in the same form. Futher you can verify it using the testing function `test_derivative()` which is used to validate the correctness of the `derivative()` function.
