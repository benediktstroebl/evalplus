    Calculate the derivative of a polynomial expressed as a list of coefficients.

    Args:

This Python script defines a function `derivative` which takes a list of coefficients `xs` corresponding to a polynomial, and returns the derivative of that polynomial as a list of coefficients. It uses a loop to calculate the derivative of each term in the polynomial, building up the result list incrementally. The derivative of a term `ax^n` involving multiplication and addition rules in action.

Here is an example of usage:
```python
test_lists = [[3, 1, 2, 4, 5], [1, 2, 3]]
expected_results = [[1, 4, 12, 20], [2, 6]]

for idx, list_ in enumerate(test_lists)):
    print(f"List {idx}:")
    print(f"  Input: {list_}")
    print(f"  Expected Output: {expected_results[idx]}")
    print("=" * 30)
    result = derivative(list_)
    print(f"  Output: {result}")
    print()
```

And here is the output:
```
List 0:
  Input: [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]
  Expected Output: [1, 4, 12, 20]
  =====================
List 1:
  Input: [1, 2, 3]
  Expected Output: [2, 6]
  =====================
Output: [1, 4, 12, 20]
List 1:
  Input: [1, 2, 3]
  Expected Output: [2, 6]
  =====================
Output: [2, 6]
```

This demonstrates the correctness of the `derivative` function.
