```python
def derivative(xs: list) -> list:
    result = [0]*len(xs)
    degree = len(xs) - 1
    for i in range(len(xs)):
        result[i] = xs[i+1] * degree
        degree -= 1
    return result
```
The given Python script defines a function `derivative` taking a list `xs` as input, which represents the coefficients of a polynomial in standard form `xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ...`. The function computes the derivative of this polynomial and returns the derivative as a list.

To compute the derivative, the function assigns 0's to the result list of the same length as `xs` to ensure compatibility with the coefficients of the polynomial. It then initiates a variable `degree` that stores the current degree of the polynomial, which is `len(xs) - 1`.

The function then iterates through each element of `xs`, starting from index 1 (since xs[0] is the constant term). It multiplies each element of `xs` by the variable `degree`, which represents the derivative of the term with respect to `x`. Subsequently, it decrements `degree` by 1 to account for the derivative of the preceding term.

Finally, the function returns the result list, which represents the derivative of the polynomial in the same form: `result[0]` is the derivative of xs[0], `result[1]` is the derivative of xs[1]x, and so on.

Here is a test case to demonstrate the correctness of the implementation:
```python
test_cases = [
    ([3, 1, 2, 4, 5], [1, 4, 12, 20]),
    ([1, 2, 3], [2, 6]),
    ([5, 5, 5, 5], [10, 10, 10])
]
for coeffs, expected in test_cases:
    assert derivative(coeffs) == expected
```
This test script checks the function's output against the expected results for different input lists of coefficients.
