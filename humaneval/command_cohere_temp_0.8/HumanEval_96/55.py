The `count_up_to()` function iterates through integers between 2 and `n` and counts the prime numbers to ensure that the count of found primes does not exceed `n`, it stops the iteration. 

The `is_prime()` function is used to check if a number is prime. It first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, in which case it is not prime. It then iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number and checks if the number is divisible by any of them. If the number is divisible by any of them, it is not prime. If the number is not divisible by any of them, it is prime. This function is used to efficiently filter out non-prime numbers from the list. 

The code passes the test cases provided in the prompt, including cases with 0, 1, and numbers less than, equal to, and greater than `n`.  It also includes a test case for a large value of `n` to ensure that the function works correctly for a larger range of numbers. 
The code could be improved by adding a more comprehensive set of tests, including tests with large numbers and more edge cases. Additionally, the `is_prime` function can be optimized by checking only up to the square root of `n`, rather than iterating up to `n`. It is a common optimization in prime checking algorithms.
