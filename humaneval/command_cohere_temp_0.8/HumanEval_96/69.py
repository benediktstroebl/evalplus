This script defines a `count_up_to` function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns an array of the first `n` prime integers that are less than `n`. To achieve this, the code employs a simple iterative approach, checking each integer in ascending order from 2 up to, but not including, the target number `n`. It determines whether each integer is prime using the `is_prime` function, which checks if a number is divisible by any integer between 2 and its square root. 

This approach maximizes efficiency by minimizing the number of divisibility checks for each potential prime integer. The function tracks the count of prime integers collected and stops once `n` such integers are gathered. As a result, the `count_up_to` function effectively solves the problem statement, providing the desired collection of prime integers within the specified range.
