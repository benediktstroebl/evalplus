Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
# relentlessness is the key to success
import math

def is_prime(n):
    """Check if an integer is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def count_up_to(n):
    """Return an array of the first n prime numbers less than n."""
    count = 0
    primes = []
    for num in range(2, n):
        if is_prime(num):
            primes.append(num)
            count += 1
        if count == n:
            break
    return primes

# The following lines are not required for the functionality, but they are useful for testing and demonstration purposes:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Example of the count_up_to function:")
    for x in count_up_to(18):
        print(x)
```

This script defines a function `count_up_to(n)` that returns an array of the first `n` prime numbers less than `n`. The function is designed to be self-contained and easy to use, without any external dependencies. 

The `count_up_to` function uses the `is_prime` function to quickly rule out multiples of integers larger than `sqrt(n)` in anticipation of the `for` loop. This is a common optimization and reduces the number of iterations required to determine primality. 

The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used for testing purposes. It prints the output of the `count_up_to` function for a specific input (`18`). 

This code demonstrates an optimized implementation of the problem statement provided, resulting in a relatively efficient primality test and solution to the problem.
