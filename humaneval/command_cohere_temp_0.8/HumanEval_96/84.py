    numbers = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_prime(i) and i < n:
            numbers += [i]

The approach used by the function `count_up_to` is iterative and linear in relation to the given number `n`. The function loops through each integer from 2 up to `n` and adds each prime number to the `numbers` list if it hasn't reached the `n` prime numbers requested. 
The `is_prime` function is used to check if a number is prime. It first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, returning False if so. If the number is greater than 1, it iterates from 2 up to the square root of the number `n`, checking if n is divisible by any number in this range. If no divisors are found, it returns True, indicating that the number is prime. 
This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loop structure, which may not be efficient for very large `n` values in the worst case. However, it performs well for smaller `n` values typical in most practical scenarios. Positively, the space complexity is O(n), demonstrating a linear relationship with the size of `n`. This indicates that the amount of additional space used by the function grows proportionally with the given input size. 
This code demonstrates a basic approach for solving the problem, but it is important to note that there are more efficient algorithms available for testing primality, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes. 
To efficiently calculate prime numbers up to 'n', the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm could be implemented to directly filter out non-prime numbers and yield prime integers up to 'n'. This approach significantly reduces the overall time complexity.
