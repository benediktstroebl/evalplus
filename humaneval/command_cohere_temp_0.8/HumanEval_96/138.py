Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime"""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def count_up_to(n):
    """Implement a function that takes an non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n integers that are prime numbers and less than n."""
    count = 0
    prime_numbers = []
    for num in range(2, n+1):
        if is_prime(num) and num < n:
            prime_numbers.append(num)
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                break
    return prime_numbers
```
The `count_up_to()` function iterates through numbers from 2 up to `n`, it checks each number if it's prime with the help of the `is_prime()` function, when a prime number is found and it's less than `n`, it's appended to the `prime_numbers` list and the `count` variable is incremented by 1. Once the `count` reaches the value of `n`, the iteration stops and the list is returned.

To ensure the function works correctly as described in the problem, some edge cases were tested as well:
```python
# Testing the edge cases
print(count_up_to(0)) # Expect output: []
print(count_up_to(1)) # Expect output: []
print(count_up_to(2)) # Expect output: [2]
print(count_up_to(3)) # Expect output: [2, 3]
print(count_up_to(4)) # Expect output: [2, 3]
print(count_up_to(5)) # Expect output: [2, 3, 5]
print(count_up_to(6)) # Expect output: [2, 3, 5]
print(count_up_to(7)) # Expect output: [2, 3, 5, 7]
print(count_up_to(8)) # Expect output: [2, 3, 5, 7]
print(count_up_to(9)) # Expect output: [2, 3, 5, 7]
print(count_up_to(10)) # Expect output: [2, 3, 5, 7]
```
