This script defines a function `count_up_to(n)` that returns an array of the first `n` prime numbers less than `n`. The function initializes an empty array `primes` to store the prime numbers and a `count` to keep track of the count of prime numbers found. It then iterates through integers from 2 up to `n - 1` and checks if each integer is prime using the `is_prime` function. If the integer is prime and less than `n`, it is added to the `primes` array and the count is incremented. The loop continues until the count reaches `n`, at which point the function returns the `primes` array.

The `is_prime` function is also included to check if a given number is prime or not. It implements a simple optimization by starting the loop from 5 instead of starting from 2. This is based on the observation that all prime numbers greater than 3 are of the form 5k + 1 or 5k - 1, where k is a positive integer.

The script also includes a list of test cases to validate the behavior of the `count_up_to` function. Each test case consists of a value of `n` and an expected array of prime numbers that should be returned. The function is then called for each test case, and the resulting array is compared to the expected array. If the two arrays match, the test case passes. If not, it fails and increments the `assert` statement. 

This code provides an efficient solution to the problem statement and demonstrates the use of primality testing and iterative techniques to generate the desired prime numbers.
