```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime"""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def count_up_to(n):
    """Implement a function that takes an non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n
    integers that are prime numbers and less than n."""
    count = 0
    primes = []
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        if is_prime(i) and i < n:
            primes.append(i)
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                break
    return primes
```

The following test cases illustrate how the function behaves:
```python
test_cases = {
    (5,): ([2, 3],),
    (11,): ([2, 3, 5, 7],),
    (0,): ([],),
    (20,): ([2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19],),
    (1,): ([],),
    (18,): ([2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17],),
}

for case, result in test_cases.items():
    assert count_up_to(*case) == result
```

This code also includes a `is_prime` function that checks whether a given number is prime, which is integral to solving this problem with a brute force approach. 

Let's break down the code step by step:
1. `is_prime(n)`: This function takes an integer `n` as input and checks whether it is a prime number or not. It employs a basic optimization technique called the `Sieve of Eratosthenes` to efficiently determine primality. Here's how it works:
    - If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `False` since prime numbers always exceed 1.
    - It starts checking for divisors from 2, as any even number (excluding 1) can be divided evenly by 2.
    - It only checks up to the square root of `n` for divisors, as any factor of `n` would be a multiple of such factors.
    * For example*, is_prime(4) * would return False because 4 is divisible by 2.
2. `count_up_to(n)`: This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the first `n` prime numbers less than `n`. It uses an iterative approach to find primes up to `n` and store them in a list. Here's how it works:
    - It initializes an empty list called `primes` to store the prime numbers and a `count` variable to keep track of the number of prime numbers found. 
    - It iterates through numbers from 2 up to `n` and checks each number with the `is_prime` function. 
    - If the current number is prime and less than `n`, it adds it to the `primes` list and increments the `count`. 
    - The loop continues until `count` reaches `n`, at which point it stops iterating. 
3. Test Cases: The script also includes a list of test cases to validate the behavior of the `count_up_to` function. Each test case provides a tuple of (`n`, `expected_primes`), where `n` is the input integer, and `expected_primes` is the expected list of prime numbers. The function is supposed
