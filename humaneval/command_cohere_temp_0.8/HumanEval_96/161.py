```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime"""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def count_up_to(n):
    """Implement a function that takes an non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n
    integers that are prime numbers and less than n."""
    count = 0
    primes = []
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if is_prime(i) and i < n:
            primes.append(i)
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                break
    return primes
```

This script defines two functions: `is_prime` checks if a given number is prime, and `count_up_to` returns the first `n` prime numbers less than `n`. 

The `count_up_to` function iterates through numbers from 2 up to `n`, adding each prime number to the `primes` list and incrementing the `count` variable. Once `count` reaches `n`, it breaks out of the loop, returning the list of prime numbers. 

This approach ensures that the function follows the instruction to return the "first n integers that are prime numbers and less than n," as per the problem statement. 

This code can be tested in the following ways:
```python
# Test cases for is_prime function
print(is_prime(0)) # Output: False
print(is_prime(1)) # Output: False
print(is_prime(2)) # Output: True
print(is_prime(3)) # Output: True
print(is_prime(4)) # Output: False
print(is_prime(5)) # Output: True
print(is_prime(6)) # Output: False

# Test cases for count_up_to function
print(count_up_to(5))  # Output: [2, 3]
print(count_up_to(11))  # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7]
print(count_up_to(0))  # Output: []
print(count_up_to(20))  # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
print(count_up_to(1))  # Output: []
print(count_up_to(18))  # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
```

These sample inputs validate the correct operation of the `is_prime` and `count_up_to` functions according to the specification requested in the question.
