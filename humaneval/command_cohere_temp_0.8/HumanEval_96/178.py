    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if is_prime(i) and i < n:
            primes.append(i)

```

The `count_up_to()` function iterates through numbers from 2 up to `n`, it checks each number using the `is_prime()` function to confirm if it's a prime number and if it's less than `n`. If it is a prime number, it adds it to the `primes` list and increments the `count` variable. Once the `count` variable reaches `n`, it breaks the loop to ensure it only collects the necessary prime numbers. The function returns the `primes` list, which contains the first `n` prime numbers less than `n`. 

To ensure the accuracy of the `is_prime()` function, it checks if the number is less than 2, as prime numbers must be greater than 1. It also looks for divisor patterns from 2 to the square root of the number, if a divisor is found, it returns `False`, ensuring that composites are accurately identified.
