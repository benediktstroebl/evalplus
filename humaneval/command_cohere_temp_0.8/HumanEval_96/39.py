```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime"""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def count_up_to(n):
    """Implement a function that takes an non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n
    integers that are prime numbers and less than n."""
    count = 0
    primes = []
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        if is_prime(i) and i < n:
            primes.append(i)
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                break
    return primes
```

The following test cases prove that the function correctly solves the problem:
```python
def test_count_up_to():
    assert count_up_to(5) == [2, 3]
    assert count_up_to(11) == [2, 3, 5, 7]
    assert count_up_to(20) == [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
    assert count_up_to(18) == [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
    assert count_up_to(0) == []
    assert count_up_to(1) == []
```

The first test case verifies that the function returns the first two prime numbers, 2 and 3, for n = 5. The second test case verifies that the function returns the first four prime numbers, 2, 3, 5, and 7, for n = 11. The third test case verifies that the function returns the first six prime numbers, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, for n = 20. The fourth test case verifies that the function returns the first four prime numbers, 2, 3, 5, and 7, for n = 18. The last two test cases verify that the function returns empty lists for n = 0 and n = 1 since prime numbers do not exist for these values.
