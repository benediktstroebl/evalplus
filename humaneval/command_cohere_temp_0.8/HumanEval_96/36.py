Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
# Markdown code block showing the implementation of the function
def count_up_to(n):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the prime numbers
    result = []
    # Iterate from 2 to n, and loop only if the current number is prime
    for num in range(2, n + 1):
        # Check if the current number is prime, and if so, add it to the result list
        if is_prime(num):
            result.append(num)
            # If the desired number of primes has been reached, break the loop
            if len(result) == n:
                break
    return result

# Function to determine if a number is prime
def is_prime(n):
    """
    Checks whether a number is prime or not.

    Args:
        n (int): Number to be checked.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.
    """
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

This script defines a `count_up_to` function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns an array of the first `n` integers that are prime numbers and less than `n`. The `is_prime` function is used to check if a number is prime. The `count_up_to` function initializes an empty list to store the prime numbers and iterates from 2 to `n` (inclusive). It tests each number with the `is_prime` function and if it is a prime number, it is appended to the `result` list. Once the desired number of primes has been reached (i.e., `len(result) == n`), the function breaks out of the loop and returns the `result` list.

Note that this implementation has a time complexity of O(n * log(n)) due to the `is_prime` function testing all numbers from 2 to `sqrt(n)`. It is essential to note that the `count_up_to` function itself has a linear time complexity of O(n), but the `is_prime` function has a secondary effect of O(n * log(n)). This does not pose a problem for small inputs, but for large inputs, alternative primality testing algorithms may need to be used.
