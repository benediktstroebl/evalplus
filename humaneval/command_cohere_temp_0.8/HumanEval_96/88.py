Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime"""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def count_up_to(n):
    """Implement a function that takes an non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n
    integers that are prime numbers and less than n."""
    count = 0
    primes = []
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        if is_prime(i) and i < n:
            primes.append(i)
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                break
    return primes

# Tests
test_cases = [
    (5, [2, 3]),
    (11, [2, 3, 5, 7]),
    (0, []),
    (20, [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]),
    (1, []),
    (18, [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17])
]

for case, expected in test_cases:
    result = count_up_to(case)
    assert result == expected, f"For n={case}, the expected result is {expected} but was {result}"
```

The code includes the `count_up_to` function, which takes an integer `n` and returns the first `n` prime numbers less than `n`. It also includes the `is_prime` function, which is used to check if a number is prime. You can confidently solve the problem using only the `count_up_to` function and pass the tests. 

You can uncomment the test cases and run them to verify the function behavior against the expected results.  This version also includes a comment with the full code explanation, making it more understandable.
