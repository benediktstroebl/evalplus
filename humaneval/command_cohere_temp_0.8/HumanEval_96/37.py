Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
# Python program to find the first
# n primes less than N
import math
# This function returns the first
# n primes less than n^2
def prime_factors(n):
	primes = []
	for i in range(2, n*int(math.sqrt(n))+1):
		# Checking if the number is prime
		# and not divisible by any number
		# less than or equal to n.
		divisible = False
		for j in range(2, n+1):
			if i%j == 0:
				divisible = True
				break
		if not divisible:
			primes.append(i)
		# Breaking out of the loop if
		# we find the required number of primes.
		if len(primes) == n:
			break
	return primes
# Driver Code
n = 18
# Function call to find the first
# n primes less than n^2
print(prime_factors(n))
```
This script defines a prime_factors function, which takes in a non-negative integer n and returns the first n prime numbers that are less than n. Within this code, the function iterates through numbers from 2 up to n*int(math.sqrt(n)) (ensuring all primes less than n are found) and checks each number for primality, adding them to a list if they are prime and less than n. When the list reaches a length of n, it returns the list of first n prime numbers. 

The driver code tests the code by calling the `prime_factors` function with a value of n set to 18. The expected output of this code is `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]` printed to the console.
