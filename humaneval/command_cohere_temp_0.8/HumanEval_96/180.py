    count = 0
    primes = []
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        if is_prime(i) and i < n:
            primes.append(i)

The function `is_prime` is used to check if a number is prime. Meanwhile, the function `count_up_to` iterates through numbers from 2 up to `n`, it checks each number using the `is_prime` function and adds it to the `primes` list if it is a prime number and less than `n`, it repeats this process until it collects `n` prime numbers, at which point it stops. 

To ensure correctness, the unit test is also provided. This test covers edge cases like 'count_up_to(0)', 'count_up_to(1)', 'count_up_to(20)', etc. You can use it to verify the correctness of the code.  If you encounter any issues, please let me know and provide feedback so I can help you solve it or adjust accordingly. 

You can use the `count_up_to(n)` function with the argument `n` to get the first `n` prime numbers less than `n`.  For example:
```python
print(count_up_to(5)) # [2, 3]
print(count_up_to(11)) # [2, 3, 5, 7]
print(count_up_to(20)) # [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
```
