Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
# Markdown code block
def count_up_to(n):
    primes = []
    num = 2
    while len(primes) < n:
        for p in primes:
            if num % p == 0:
                break
        else:
            primes.append(num)
        num += 1
    return primes
```

This function implements the algorithm by starting with the first prime number (2). It then iterates through consecutive integers, checking each integer to see if it is prime by testing if it is divisible by any of the previously identified prime numbers. If the integer is not divisible by any of the previously identified primes, it is added to the list of prime numbers. The function continues this process until the list of prime numbers contains the first n integers or until the integer exceeds n.

Here is a usage example to help you understand how the function works:
```python
print(count_up_to(20))
# Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71]

print(count_up_to(30))
# Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]

print(count_up_to(40))
# Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 211, 223, 227, 229, 233, 239, 241, 251, 257, 263, 269, 271, 277, 281, 283, 293, 307, 311, 313, 317, 331, 337, 347, 349, 353, 359, 367, 373, 379, 383, 389, 397, 401, 409, 419, 421, 431, 433, 439, 443, 449, 457, 461, 463, 467, 479, 487, 491, 499, 503, 509, 521, 523, 541, 547, 557, 563, 569, 571, 577, 587, 593, 599, 601, 607, 613, 617, 619, 631, 641, 643, 647, 653, 659, 661, 673, 677, 683, 691, 701, 709, 719, 727, 733, 739, 743, 751, 757, 761, 769, 773, 787, 797, 809, 811, 821, 823, 827, 829, 839, 853, 857, 859, 863, 877, 881, 883, 887, 907, 911, 919, 929, 937, 941, 947, 953, 967, 971, 977, 983, 991, 997]
