    for i in range(2, n+1):
        if is_prime(i) and i < n:
            primes.append(i)

The `is_prime` function is used to check if a number is prime. Then the `count_up_to` function generates an array of the first `n` prime numbers less than `n` with the help of a simple loop that iterates through integers between 2 and `n`, and adds the prime integers to the `primes` list. The `count` variable keeps track of the count of prime numbers added to the list. Once the count reaches `n`, the function stops adding more numbers to the list and breaks out of the loop. The function returns the `primes` list in the end.

This solution has a time complexity of `O(n^2)`, as the `is_prime` function has a linear time complexity, and the loop iterates over all numbers from 2 to `n`. The space complexity is `O(n)` as it stores all the prime numbers up to `n`. 

This solution is inefficient for larger input `n` as the time complexity increases, so developers might consider other more efficient solutions like the Sieve of Eratosthenes for better performance. However, this will depend on the specific constraints and requirements of the problem and the context in which it is being applied.
