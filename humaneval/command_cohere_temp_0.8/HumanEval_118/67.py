This Python script defines a function `get_closest_vowel` taking a parameter `word` that performs the task requested in the prompt. It iterates over the word using a dictionary approach to check if the next character is a consonant. It identifies the first vowel standing between two consonants from the right side of the word and returns it. The case of the vowel is the same as the case of the word entered. The script returns an empty string if no such vowel is found. 

The total time complexity of this Python script is O(N), where N represents the size of the input string `word`. It uses constant space to store the dictionary of consonant and vowel characters, which doesn't affect the overall space complexity of the script.
