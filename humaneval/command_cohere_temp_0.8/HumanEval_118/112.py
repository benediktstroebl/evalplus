This script assumes that the input language is English. Moreover, it assumes that the input will only contain alphabetic characters. Lastly, it assumes that the word is of a single case (either all uppercase or all lowercase). 

To ensure clarity and readability, the code includes inline comments throughout to explain each part of the logic. This is particularly important for complex solutions or intricate problems. 

The example tests provided correspond to the specified problem to ensure proper functionality.
