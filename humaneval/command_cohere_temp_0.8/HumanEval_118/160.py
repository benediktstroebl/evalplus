The algorithm for this function proceeds by first identifying the indices of consonants and vowels within the input word. The goal is to find the closest vowel to the right of the rightmost consonant or the vowel following the rightmost consonant. The function returns an empty string if there are no consonants present. Otherwise, it checks the following conditions:
1. Only one consonant is present and there is at least one vowel in the word. In this case, the function returns the entire part of the word starting from the last vowel. 
2. More than one consonant is present and there is more than one vowel in the word. The function identifies the rightmost consonant and determines the two closest vowels to it: 
    - The last vowel before the rightmost consonant. 
    - The next vowel after the rightmost consonant. 

The function then returns the part of the word from the next vowel to the last vowel. This algorithm efficiently solves the problem and provides the closest vowel in the required conditions. In the examples provided in the prompt, the function returns the following outputs:
- "yogurt": "u"
- "FULL": "U"
- "quick": ""
- "ab": ""
