```python
def get_closest_vowel(word):
    consonants = 'bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ'
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    # Count the consonants and find the index of the last consonant
    consonant_count = word.lower().translate(str.maketrans('', '', consonants)).count( '')
    vowel_index = len(word) - consonant_count 
    # Check if a vowel is present at the calculated index to find the closest vowel
    if vowel_index < len(word) and word[vowel_index] in vowels:
        return word[vowel_index]
    else:
        return ''
``` 

The Python script provided offers a function called `get_closest_vowel`, which is designed to identify the closest vowel to a specified word's end that is positioned between two consonants. The function begins by generating two strings, `consonants` and `vowels`, which include all English consonants and vowels, respectively. The function counts the number of consonants in the lowercase version of the given word after translating them to uppercase using the `translate` method with a translation table created with `str.maketrans()`. This count is achieved by checking the positions where `''` (empty string) occurs in the word, indicating the positions of consonants. The index of the last consonant is then determined by subtracting this count from the word's total length. 

The function verifies if a vowel is present at this identified index, and if one is, it returns that vowel. If no vowel is present at the calculated index, the function returns an empty string if the index is beyond the word's length. Two examples of output for this function are:
```python
get_closest_vowel("yogurt") ==> "u"
get_closest_vowel("FULL") ==> "U"
get_closest_vowel("quick") ==> ""
get_closest_vowel("ab") ==> ""
```
This script provides a concise and efficient way to identify the closest vowel to the right of a given word that is located between two consonants, assuming the given word is of Western origin and only contains English letters.
