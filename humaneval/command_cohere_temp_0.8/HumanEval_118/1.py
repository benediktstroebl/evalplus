The Python script provides a function called `get_closest_vowel` which takes a word as its input. This function's purpose is to identify the nearest vowel that lies between two consonants, starting from the right side of the word. It counts the number of consonants occurring in the word using a loop to iterate through each character. When a vowel is encountered, it marks its presence, ignoring non-alphabetic characters. 

If the word contains more than one consonant with at least one vowel in between, the function calculates the index of the vowel closest to the right-most consonant. It then returns this vowel, or an empty string if none is found. However, if the word consists of just one consonant or no consonants at all, an empty string is returned to indicate the absence of the required configuration of vowels and consonants. 

The given examples in the prompt are tested and the function successfully passes the corresponding tests.
