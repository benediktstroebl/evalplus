```python
def get_closest_vowel(word):
    """
    Finds the closest vowel to the right of a word, assuming vowels at the start and end of the word are excluded.
    """
    # Ensure the word has only alphabetic characters and is case-sensitive
    if not all(char.isalpha() for char in word):
        return ""

    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    index_of_last_vowel = word.rfind("a", 0, len(word) - 1)  
    
    if index_of_last_vowel == -1:
        return ""

    for i in range(len(word) - 1, index_of_last_vowel - 1, -1):
        if word[i] in vowels:
            return word[i]
    return word[index_of_last_vowel]
```

This approach involves several steps:
1. Ensuring the input word only contains alphabetic characters and is case-sensitive by checking `all(char.isalpha() for char in word)`.
2. Creating a `vowels` string containing all vowel characters that we'll be searching for.
3. Finding the index of the last vowel in the word excluding vowels at the very end using `word.rfind("a", 0, len(word) - 1)`.
4. Checking if this index is -1, which implies there are no vowels excluding those at the end, returning an empty string accordingly.
5. Iterating through the word in reverse to check if there's a vowel character before the last vowel, and if found, returning it.
6. If not, we return the last vowel character in the word, i.e., the one at the index of the last vowel character.

This code should accurately find the closest vowel to the right of a given word while excluding starting and ending vowels.
