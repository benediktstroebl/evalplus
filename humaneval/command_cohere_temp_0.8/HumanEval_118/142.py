```python
def get_closest_vowel(word):
    """You are given a word. Your task is to find the closest vowel that stands between 
    two consonants from the right side of the word (case sensitive).
    
    Vowels in the beginning and ending doesn't count. Return empty string if you didn't
    find any vowel met the above condition. 

    You may assume that the given string contains English letter only.

    Example:
    get_closest_vowel("yogurt") ==> "u"
    get_closest_vowel("FULL") ==> "U"
    get_closest_vowel("quick") ==> ""
    get_closest_vowel("ab") ==> ""
    """
    # Using regex to check right-most vowel (assuming it is not the last char)
    regex = r'(?<=.*?[bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ])([AEIOUaeiou])(?=.*?[bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ])'
    match = re.search(regex, word)
    return match.group(1) if match else ""
```
The provided solution utilizes regular expressions to identify the right-most vowel that is not part of the last 2 characters of the given word and is surrounded by consonants. The regex used is (?<=.*?[bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ])([AEIOUaeiou])(?=.*?[bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ]).

This ensures that the vowel is not part of the last 2 characters and is surrounded by consonants. The group(1) captures the targeted vowel, which is then returned. For cases where no such vowel exists, an empty string is returned. 
```python 
get_closest_vowel("yogurt") == "u"
get_closest_vowel("FULL") == "U"
get_closest_vowel("quick") == ""
get_closest_vowel("ab") == ""
``` 
The provided code will correctly identify the closest vowel in these examples.
