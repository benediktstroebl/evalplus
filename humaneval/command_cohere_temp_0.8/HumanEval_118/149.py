This function defines a vowels string for easy indexing, then iterates through the input word. It checks if the current character is a consonant and that there is a vowel to the left of it (ensuring that we are in the middle of a word). For each qualifying consonant, it checks if it's closer to a vowel than the previous closest vowel and updates the closest vowel and its index if so. The function returns the closest vowel if found, or an empty string if none is found in the word. 

The function includes a test suite to ensure it behaves correctly:
```python
test_cases = [
    ("ab", ""),
    ("bc", "a"),
    ("milk", "i"),
    ("Safer", "e"),
    ("Hello", ""),
    ("Soft", "o"),
    ("Quick", ""),
    ("lie", "i"),
    ("NO", ""),
    ("Yes", "e"),
]

for word, expected in test_cases:
    result = get_closest_vowel(word)
    assert result == expected, f"For the word {word}, expected {expected} but got {result}"
```
