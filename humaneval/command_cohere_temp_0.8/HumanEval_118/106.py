```python
def get_closest_vowel(word):
    vowels = 'AEIOUaeiou'
    len_word = len(word)
    
    # Make sure the word isn't empty
    if len_word == 0:
        return ''

    # If the last character is a vowel, return it
    if word[-1] in vowels:
        return word[-1]

    # Check if the last consonant is surrounded by two vowels
    idx_consonant = len_word - 1
    while idx_consonant >= 0 and word[idx_consonant] not in vowels:
        idx_consonant -= 1

    # If such consonant exists and there's a vowel to the right of it, return that vowel
    if idx_consonant + 1 < len_word and word[idx_consonant + 1] in vowels:
        return word[idx_consonant + 1]

    # If no close vowels are found, return the very last character of the word (which is a consonant)
    return word[-1]
```

This approach checks if the last character of the word is a vowel. If it is, the function returns it. If it isn't, the function searches for the last consonant in the word (from the right). If this consonant is surrounded by two vowels, the function returns the next vowel. If no such vowel is found, the function returns the last character of the word, which is the consonant. This methodology solves the issue correctly, according to the given examples. 

This code is assuming only uppercase letters are in the word, but the same approach could be taken for lowercase letters or a combination of both, just with differing letter values. 

Let me know if I've misunderstood the problem or if there's a specific case you'd like me to test!
