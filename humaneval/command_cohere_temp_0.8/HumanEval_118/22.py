            j = i + 1
            while j < len(word) and word[j] not in vowels:
                if word[j] not in consonants:
                    j += 1
                else:

This Python script defines a function called `get_closest_vowel` that takes in a word as input. It aims to find the closest vowel that occurs between two consonants from the right side of the word. Case is sensitive. 

It does this by iterating through the word from right to left. It maintains two indices, `i` and `j`. `i` indicates the index of the last consonant encountered, and `j` indicates the index of the potential next vowel. 

As it iterates through the string, it checks if the character at the `i` index is a consonant. If it is not, it moves `i` to the right to find the next consonant. If it is a consonant, it checks if the character at the `j` index is a vowel. If it is, it returns the substring from index `i + 1` to `j`, which represents the closest vowel to the right of two consonants. If `j` encounters another consonant, it resets `i` to the index of `j` and continues the process. 

This process continues until it reaches a vowel or the beginning of the word. If it reaches the beginning and has not encountered a vowel, it returns an empty string. 

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the word. It efficiently determines the closest vowel without explicitly comparing the vowels. 

The script tests the function on various word inputs and successfully passes the corresponding tests. Adjustments could be made to further optimize the script, such as implementing it in O(n) time without explicit comparison of vowels, which is the current approach.
