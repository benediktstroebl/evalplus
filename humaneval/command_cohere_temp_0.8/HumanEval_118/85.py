This Python script provides a self-contained function called `get_closest_vowel` that takes a single argument, `word`. This function aims to find the closest vowel to a consonant in a given word while considering cases where the vowel is surrounded by consonants. It examines the word from right to left, checking each character as it moves backward. It uses a dictionary to quickly identify consonants, updating the closest vowel as it iterates through the word. The function isolates the task, focusing solely on the given problem, which can be useful for competitive programming, where problems are often isolated to specific tasks.  This approach significantly improves the code readability and maintainability, making it easier to understand and modify for other problems.  This type of problem is common in coding interviews, where the focus is on solving a specific task with clean and efficient code.  The function assumes that the input contains only English letters, which is a reasonable assumption for this problem.  This type of challenge helps to assess problem-solving skills and the ability to optimize solutions.  The provided examples showcase the function's behavior for different inputs and demonstrate that it produces the expected outputs.  This type of challenge can be used to evaluate programming skills and problem-solving abilities in job interviews.  The function returns an empty string if it doesn't find any qualifying vowels, addressing the edge case where there are only consonants in the word.  This way, the code handles all possible scenarios and returns a sensible result.  This approach ensures that the function handles all possible word compositions and provides the appropriate response.  This function balances code simplicity and readability, making it an elegant solution for the given problem statement. 
This solution can be tested with various inputs to ensure it meets the problem requirements and behaves correctly for all possible scenarios. 
It is also important to note that this function's current implementation assumes that consonants are located on the right side of the word. However,
