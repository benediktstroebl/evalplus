This script defines a function `get_closest_vowel()` that takes in a word as an argument. It collects consonants occurring in the word into a list `cons`. The function then aims to find the closest vowel lying between two consecutive consonants from the right side of the word. If there are less than two consonants, or if there is only one consonant, the function returns an empty string.

The algorithm narrows down the search for the closest vowel by comparing the conscripts from both ends of the word and eliminating identical consecutive consonants. It iterates over the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' to find the one that is present in the sequence of conscripts between the leftmost and rightmost consonants. The function returns the first vowel meeting this condition, or an empty string if none is found. 

The provided example tests pass with the given code, showcasing its functionality and correctness.  This solution has a time complexity of `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input word, and a space complexity of `O(1)`.
