```

The provided code defines a function `get_closest_vowel(word)` that takes a word as input and aims to find the closest vowel to the right side of the word, assuming that the vowel is sandwiched between two consonants. Here's a breakdown of the code:
1. The function starts with a comment that explains the problem statement.
2. It defines a string `vowels` that contains all the possible vowels (both uppercase and lowercase).
3. The word is converted to lowercase and split into individual tokens using a slice, assuming that the word contains only English letters and might contain tokens that are either consonants or vowels.
4. If the length of the tokens is less than 3, it means there might not be enough tokens to form a consonant-vowel-consonant pattern, so an empty string is returned.
5. The function then uses the `find` method to search for the last vowel token (converted to lowercase) from the right side of the word.
6. It then returns the closest vowel (either uppercase or lowercase) to the right side of the word. If the above `find` method returns `-2`, it means the last token is a vowel, and it returns that token. Otherwise, it returns the vowel at the index of the last token.

The code assumes that the given word contains only English letters, and it might return false positives for words that have vowels elsewhere. It also assumes that there are no punctuation marks or other non-letter characters in the input word.

Let's break down the code step by step and explain each piece:
1. **Comments:** The code starts with a comment that reiterates the problem statement. This is helpful for future reference when reading the code.
2. **String Constant:** `vowels` contains all possible vowel characters, both uppercase and lowercase. This will be used to find the closest vowel to the right side of the word.
3. **Tokenization:** The line `tokens = word.lower().splitNonUserTokens()` tokenizes the input word. It first lowercases the entire word, then uses Python's slice notation to split the word into tokens based on non-letter characters. This assumes that the word only contains letters (consonants and vowels) and potentially some punctuation.
4. **Check Token Length:** The conditional `if len(tokens) < 3` checks if there are enough tokens to form a consonant-vowel-consonant pattern. If there are less than 3 tokens, it means there might not be a vowel to find, so the function returns an empty string.
5. **Find the Last Vowel:** The line `vowelIndex = vowels.find(tokens[-2])` searches for the last vowel token from the right side of the word. The `find` method looks for a match in the `vowels` string, and the `-2` token refers to the second-to-last token in the `tokens` list.
6. **Return
