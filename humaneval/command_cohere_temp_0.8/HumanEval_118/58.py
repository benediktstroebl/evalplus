```

This code defines a function `get_closest_vowel()` that takes in a word as input. It iterates through each character in the word, checking if it is a vowel. If the character is a vowel and is not at the beginning or end of the word, it sets the result to that vowel. The function then breaks out of the loop and returns the result. If no qualifying vowels are found in the full range of the word, the function returns an empty string. 

The code also includes assertions that validate the input, ensuring it is a case-sensitive string of English letters only. If the input word fails this validation check, the code will throw an assertion error with a message detailing the issue. This is demonstrated in the comments of the code, and could be removed if desired. 

This solution is efficient as it iterates through the characters only once, with a single loop. It operates over the word in a single pass, making it an O(n) solution where n is the size of the input word. 

This solution works under the assumption that the input contains only English letters, and doesn't require any additional libraries. It handles vowel variations from different letter cases and is straightforward in its approach, making it easily understandable.
