This script provides a solution for the problem statement, and its function `get_closest_vowel` works for various test cases including edge cases. It uses smart indexing and subtracting to identify the rightmost vowel that is flanked by two consonants. The function makes use of a set to remove duplicates and to identify the latest index of interest. Also, it is assumed that the provided words only contain English letters only.
