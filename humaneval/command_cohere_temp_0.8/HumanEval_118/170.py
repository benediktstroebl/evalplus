This script assumes only letters in the English alphabet are contained in the input word and utilizes string manipulation to find the closest vowel to the right of the word, assuming vowels at the start and end of the word do not count. It also ensures the input contains only alphabetic characters before processing it. 

Let's break down the solution into several parts:
1. **Input Validation**: The function starts by checking if every character in the input word is an English letter. If this is not the case, a `ValueError` is raised, as the problem statement specifies that the input contains only English letters.
2. **Initialize Variables**: The function then lowers the entire word to make the problem case-insensitive. It strips all vowels (letters 'a' to 'u') from the right side of the word, as the problem specifies that vowels at the start and end don't count. The word is then split into individual characters, and these are divided into two lists: consonants and vowels. The latter is reversed to point towards the right side of the word.
3. **Find the Right-Most Vowel**: The function then iterates through the right-most consonants first, looking for a vowel that is between two consonants (excluding starting and ending vowels). The first vowel encountered that meets these criteria is stored in the `closest_vowel` variable.
4. **Check if a Vowel was Found**: After the iteration, the function checks if a vowel was stored in `closest_vowel`. If not, no such vowel was found, and the function returns an empty string. Otherwise, it returns the vowel that met the criteria. 

The above solution is optimized for cases where the word contains many potential candidates for the closest vowel, as it only considers right-most vowels and does not make unnecessary iterations over the entire word. 

The provided tests in the code block pass, validating the function's behavior.
