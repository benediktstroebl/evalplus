This script assumes that consonants are surrounded by vowels in the word (like in "tick" or "silly"), and finds the vowel closest to the rightmost consonant, excluding starting and ending vowels. It splits the word into onsets (vowels) and rhymes (consonants) and calculates the distance of each vowel to the rightmost consonant's position, choosing the one with the maximum distance. 

The output of the provided examples in the prompt is:
- `u` for "yogurt"
- "U" for "FULL"
- "" for "quick"
- "" for "ab"
