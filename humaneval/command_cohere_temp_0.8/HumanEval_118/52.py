```python
def get_closest_vowel(word):
    """
    Find the closest vowel to the right of consonant sequences within a word.
    """
    
    # Split the word into individual characters and initialize the closest vowel found.
    word_list = list(word)
    closest_vowel = ''
    
    # Iterate through the word from right to left.
    for i in range(1, len(word_list)):
        # Check if the current character is a consonant.
        if word_list[i].lower() not in 'aeuio':
            # If the previous character is a vowel, assign it as the closest vowel.
            if i > 0 and word_list[i-1].lower() in 'aeuio':
                closest_vowel = word_list[i-1]
            # If a consonant sequence is found, break out of the loop.
            else:
                break
    
    # Return the found closest vowel or an empty string.
    return closest_vowel or ''
```

The function leverages a rightward iteration through the word to identify consonant sequences. When such a sequence is encountered, the function checks the previous character. If it's a vowel, it's assigned as the closest vowel. The function ultimately returns the closest vowel found or an empty string if no eligible vowel is encountered. 

This approach ensures that the function tackles the problem in an efficient and effective manner, delivering the required results.
