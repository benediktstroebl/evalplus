The provided Python script defines a function `get_closest_vowel` that aims to find the closest vowel to a specified word, considering certain conditions. Specifically, the function searches for a vowel that falls between two consonants from the right side of the word, excluding vowels at the beginning and end of the word. The function evaluates each character of the given word, classifying it as a consonant or a vowel. It uses a dictionary to store the indices of consonants and tracks the previous and next indices of vowels. As the function iterates through the word, it checks if there is a sequence of consonants longer than 2. If so, it yields the part of the word that includes the vowels and the following consonants, effectively providing the closest vowel sequence to the given word. 

The example usage alongside the function definition showcases the behavior of the function and demonstrates how it finds the closest vowel sequence in a word while adhering to the given constraints. 

This solution achieves the problem's goal while maintaining a self-contained implementation within the specified code block.
