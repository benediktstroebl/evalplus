```python
def get_closest_vowel(word):
    consonants = 'bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ'
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    
    index = next((i for i, char in enumerate(word) if char in consonants), len(word))
    prev, cur = word[index-1:index], word[index:]
    
    if cur:
        return cur[0] if cur[0] in vowels else cur[1] if cur[1] in vowels else ''
    
    return word[index-1] if word[index-1] in vowels else ''
``` 

The problem definition is repeated here for clarity:
```python
def get_closest_vowel(word):
    """You are given a word. Your task is to find the closest vowel that stands between 
    two consonants from the right side of the word (case sensitive).
    
    Vowels in the beginning and ending doesn't count. Return empty string if you didn't
    find any vowel met the above condition. 

    You may assume that the given string contains English letter only.

    Example:
    get_closest_vowel("yogurt") ==> "u"
    get_closest_vowel("FULL") ==> "U"
    get_closest_vowel("quick") ==> ""
    get_closest_vowel("ab") ==> ""
    """
```

This script provides a function `get_closest_vowel` that addresses the problem statement. It first identifies consonants in the word, then checks if there are any vowels immediately following the consonants. If so, it returns the first such vowel. If not, it examines the character immediately to the left of the consonants, returning an empty string if no suitable vowels are found. 

The code enables efficient problem-solving for the given challenge and adheres to Python's readability guidelines.
