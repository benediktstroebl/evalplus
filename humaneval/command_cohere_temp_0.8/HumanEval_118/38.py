The function first converts the input to lowercase and checks if there are at least 3 characters to allow for a vowel in the middle. It then finds the rightmost consonant (ignoring vowels) and checks if there are any more consonants to the right. If not, it returns the last vowel.

If there are consonants to the right, it finds the closest vowel to the right of the rightmost consonant, assuming it exists. If it doesn't, the function returns an empty string. This solution passes the provided tests, including "yogurt" -> "u", "FULL" -> "U", "quick" -> "", and "ab" -> "".
