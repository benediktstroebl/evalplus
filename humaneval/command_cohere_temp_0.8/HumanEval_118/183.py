This Python script provides a function called `get_closest_vowel` that addresses the problem statement. It iterates through each character in the given `word`. It counts the number of consecutive consonants using a counter `cons_count`. It also checks if each character is a vowel or not. Then, if there are more than 1 consecutive consonants, it iterates through the characters from the right to left and returns the closest vowel to the right of the word (skipping the last character if it is a vowel). However, if there aren't more than 1 consecutive consonants, it returns an empty string. 

The output of the function is either an empty string or the closest vowel to the right of the word if it meets the criteria stated in the problem. The given code passes all the tests and meets the requirements of the problem.
