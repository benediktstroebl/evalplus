This code defines a function `get_closest_vowel` that performs the task outlined in the prompt. It iterates through the characters of the input word, tracking instances of vowels and consonants. When a vowel is encountered but not followed by a consonant, it is ignored. When a consonant is encountered and followed by a vowel, the subsequent vowel is returned. If no suitable vowel is found within the word, an empty string is returned. This approach ensures that the function considers both uppercase and lowercase vowels and provides the desired output for the given examples in the prompt, including edge cases where no suitable vowel is found. 

The `main` function is included to run the tests specified in the prompt and verify the correctness of the `get_closest_vowel` function. Adjustments were made to the original formulation to ensure accurate identification of consonants and vowels and to cover all edge cases.
