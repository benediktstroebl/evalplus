            if not vowel:
                cons_count += 1
        else:
            continue
    if cons_count > 1:
        for i in range(len(word) - 1, -1, -1):

This Python script provides a function called `get_closest_vowel` that addresses the problem statement. It iterates through each character in the given `word`. It counts the number of consecutive consonants using a `cons_count` variable. In addition, it identifies vowels and their positions. Consequently, if there are more than 1 consecutive consonants, it searches for the closest vowel from the right starting from the last character and returns it. The result is an empty string if no qualifying vowel is found. 

The code ensures simplicity and efficiency by avoiding complex data structures and utilizing basic loops. It has a clear understandable comment block that explains the logic and also provides examples. 

The unit tests are also included to verify the correct behavior of the code and to ensure that it passes all the tests.
