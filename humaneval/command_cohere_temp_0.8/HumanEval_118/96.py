```

The problem is solved employing the rightmost consonant's index to find the closest vowel on both sides of the word. If there is no consonant, an empty string is returned. To determine if a character is a consonant or vowel, a lambda function is used, taking the Character's ASCII value and checking if it falls between the range of lowercase and uppercase English vowels. This approach ensures that the rightmost consonant's index is used to find the closest vowel, even if it is not the very last character of the word, as a consonant may be present on the very last character as well. 

This solution works for all examples provided in the problem statement and should be efficient with respect to the size of the input. 

To improve the solution's readability, here's a brief explanation of the code:
1. The `right_consonant_index` is defined as the index of the rightmost consonant in the word. The lambda function is used to check if a character is a consonant.
2. The closest vowels to the right of the rightmost consonant are checked using the right_consonant_index + 1 and right_consonant_index - 1 indices. The lambda function is used to check if a character is a vowel.
3. The function returns an empty string if there are no consonants in the word.
4. If there are consonants but no vowels, the function returns an empty string.
5. If there are consonants and vowels, the function returns the closest vowel to the right of the rightmost consonant. 

This solution effectively tackles the problem by leveraging the rightmost consonant's index and checking for vowels on both sides of it. It assumes that the given input is only English letters.
