Here's a Python script that implements the `valid_date` function described in the markdown code block:
```python
import re

def valid_date(date):
    """
    Validates a given date string and returns True if the date is valid, otherwise False.
    """
    if not date:
        return False
    match = re.match(r"^(\d\d?)[-/](\d\d?)[-/](\d\d\d\d)$", date)
    if not match:
        return False
    day, month, year = map(int, match.groups())
    
    # Month and day validation
    if month < 1 or month > 12:
        return False
    if month == 2 and day not in range(1, 30):
        return False
    if month in (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12) and day not in range(1, 32):
        return False
    if month in (4, 6, 9, 11) and day not in range(1, 31):
        return False

    # Check for leap year
    if (year % 4 == 0 and month == 2 and day > 29) or 
        (year % 100 != 0 and year % 400 == 0 and month == 2 and day != 29):
        return False
    
    return True
```

This code uses the re-module to validate the date format and then checks the constraints on the date components. Feel free to test this function with various valid and invalid dates to ensure it works as expected. 
If you encounter any issues or have further questions, please let me know!  This solution should effectively handle the date validation problem while maintaining a clean and efficient codebase.
