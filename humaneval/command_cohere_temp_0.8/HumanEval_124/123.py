Here's a Python script that implements the `valid_date` function described in the markdown code block:
```python
import re

def valid_date(date):
    """
    Validates a given date string and returns True if the date is valid, otherwise False.
    """
    if not date:
        return False
    
    # Extract year, month, and day from the date string
    date_parts = re.match(r"^(\d{2})[-/](\d{1,2})[-/](\d{4})$", date)
    
    if not date_parts or date_parts.group(3) == "0000":
        return False
    
    year = int(date_parts.group(3))
    month = int(date_parts.group(2))
    day = int(date_parts.group(1))
    
    # Month and day validation
    if 1 <= month <= 12:
        month = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12].index(month) + 1
        max_day = [31, 29, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30][month - 1]
        if day < 1 or day > max_day:
            return False
    
    # Date format validation
    if not re.match(r"^(\d{2})[-/](\d{1,2})[-/](\d{4})$", date):
        return False
    
    # Month validation
    if 1 <= month <= 12:
        return True
    
    return False
```

This code uses regular expressions to validate the date against the criteria you provided in the problem statement. It checks for the presence of all components, validates the month and day values against the appropriate ranges, and ensures the date is in the expected format.

Let's break down the key components:
1. `date_parts = re.match(r"^(\d{2})[-/](\d{1,2})[-/](\d{4})$", date)`: This regular expression extracts the individual components of the date string. It matches a two-digit month, optionally followed by a hyphen or slash, a one-to-two digit day, optionally followed by a hyphen or slash, and a four-digit year. The `re.match` function returns a match object if the date matches this pattern, or `None` if it doesn't.
2. `if not date_parts or date_parts.group(3) == "0000":`: This condition checks for two things:
    - `not date_parts`: Verifies if the initial regex match failed, meaning the date doesn't have the expected format.
    - `date_parts.group(3) == "0000"`: Checks if the extracted year is "0000", which would indicate an invalid year.
3. `year, month, day = map(int, date_parts.groups())`: This converts the matched groups (year, month, day) from strings to integers. The `map` function applies the `int` function to each group.
4. The `if 1 <= month <= 12` block:
    - This checks if the month is within the valid range of 1 to 12.
    - If it is, the month is adjusted to its numerical month number (1-12). This is necessary because the statement says to use the index of the month in the month_days list, which represents the number of days in each month.
5. The `return False` statements: These are used to return False if any validation condition is not met.

Overall, the code attempts
