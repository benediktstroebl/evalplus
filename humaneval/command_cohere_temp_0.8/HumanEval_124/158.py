Here's a Python script that defines a function called `valid_date` to validate a date string and returns `True` if the date is valid and `False` otherwise. The date is considered valid if it satisfies the following rules:
1. The date string is not empty.
2. The number of days is not less than 1 and not greater than the valid number of days for the corresponding month (between 1 and 31 for months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, and between 1 and 30 for months 4, 6, 9, 11). The month 2 (February) is exceptioned here, where the number of days is not less than 1 and not greater than 29.
3. The months should not be less than 1 (January) or greater than 12 (December).
4. The date should be in the format `mm-dd-yyyy`.

```python
import re

def valid_date(date):
    """
    Validate a date string and return True if the date is valid.
    Otherwise, return False.
    """
    # Pattern to match the date format
    date_format = re.compile(r"^(\d{2})[-/](\d{2})[-/](\d{4})$")

    # Checking if the date string is empty
    if not date:
        return False

    # Checking the date format
    if not date_format.match(date):
        return False

    year, month, day = map(int, date.split('-'))

    # Checking the range of the day for each month
    if month == 2 and day not in range(1, 29):
        return False
    elif month in [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12] and day not in range(1, 31):
        return False
    elif month in [4, 6, 9, 11] and day not in range(1, 30):
        return False

    # Checking the range of the month
    if month < 1 or month > 12:
        return False

    return True
```

This code can be explained in four main sections:
1. **Importing Regular Expression Module**: The code starts by importing the `re` module, which is used to work with regular expressions. Regular expressions are a powerful tool for pattern matching and manipulation of strings.
2. **Defining the Date Format Regex**: The `date_format` variable is a regular expression pattern compiled using the `re.compile` function. This pattern string `r"^(\d{2})[-/](\d{2})[-/](\d{4})$"` matches the date format `mm-dd-yyyy`, where `mm` represents the two-digit month, `dd` represents the two-digit day, and `yyyy` represents the four-digit year.
3. **Handling Empty Dates**: The code checks if the `date` string is empty using basic Python syntax `if not date:`. This line checks if the date variable is empty or not, and if it is, the function returns False since an empty date string is not valid.
4. **Validating Date Components**: If the date string is not empty, the code uses the `re.match` function to check if the date string matches the `date_format` pattern. It retrieves the three components (year, month, day) from the date string by splitting it using the hyphen ('-') and converts them into integer values using the `map` function. 

Further, the code checks the validity of each component:
- For February, the day value is checked against the range [1, 29]. If the
