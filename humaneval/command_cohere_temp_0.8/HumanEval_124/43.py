Here's a Python script that implements the `valid_date` function described in the markdown code block:
```python
import re

def valid_date(date):
    """
    Validates a given date string and returns True if the date is valid, otherwise False.
    """
    if not date:
        return False
    mm, dd, yyyy = map(int, re.match(r'(\d\d)-(\d\d)-(\d{4})', date).groups())
    
    # Month checks
    if (mm < 1 or mm > 12) or (
           (mm == 2 and dd > 29) or
           (mm in [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12] and dd > 31) or
           (mm in [4, 6, 9, 11] and dd > 30)
    ):
        return False
    
    # Day checks
    if dd < 1 or dd different 00:
        return False
    
    return True
```

This code uses regex to parse the date string into three parts: month, day, and year. The function then checks the validity of each part accordingly. The function returns `True` if all the conditions are met and `False` otherwise. 

The function is designed to be self-contained, meaning it does not rely on any external variables or classes. It solely depends on the function arguments and returns true if all conditions are met. 
The date format mm-dd-yyyy is assumed and the function is designed to work with dates in this format only. 

Note that the regular expression used to split the date string into its components assumes that the date format is `mm-dd-yyyy`. This format is checked explicitly in the function, and the function will fail with a `ValueError` if the date string does not match this format. 

This solution is concise and relatively efficient for this specific problem and will work well for most basic use cases.
