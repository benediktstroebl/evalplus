Here's a Python script that defines a function called `valid_date` to validate a date string and return `True` if the date is valid and `False` otherwise. The date is considered valid if it satisfies the following rules:

1. The date string is not empty.
2. The number of days is between 1 and the maximum number of days allowed for the corresponding month (between 1 and 31 for months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, between 1 and 30 for months 4, 6, 9, and 11, and between 1 and 29 for month 2).
3. The months should be between 1 and 12.
4. The date is in the format `mm-dd-yyyy`.

The script includes test cases that cover different scenarios to ensure the function's correctness:

```python
import re

def valid_date(date):
    """
    Validate a date string and return True if the date is valid.
    
    Args:
        date (str): A date string in the format "mm-dd-yyyy".
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the date is valid, False otherwise.
    """
    if not date:
        return False
    
    mm, dd, yyyy = map(int, re.match(r"(\d\d)-(\d\d)-(\d{4})", date).groups())
    
    # Check if the day and month values are within the valid range
    if mm < 1 or mm > 12 or dd < 1 or ((mm <= 2 and dd > 29) or (mm > 2 and dd > 31)):
        return False
    
    # Check if the year value is four digits only
    if len(yyyy) != 4:
        return False
    
    return True

# Test cases
print(valid_date("06-04-2020"))  # Should print: True
print(valid_date("03-11-2000"))  # Should print: True
print(valid_date("15-01-2012"))  # Should print: False
print(valid_date("04-0-2040"))  # Should print: False
print(valid_date("06/04/2020"))  # Should print: False
print(valid_date(""))  # Should print: False
```

The function checks each clause separately:

1. It checks if the date string is empty, and returns False immediately if it is.
2. It extracts the month, day, and year from the date string using a regular expression and converts them to integer values. It then checks if the day and month values are within the valid range based on the rules you provided.
3. It checks if the year value is a four-digit number.
4. If all the conditions are met, the function returns True, if any condition is not met, it returns False. 
5. The test cases cover a variety of valid and invalid date strings to ensure that the function is correctly implemented and behaves as expected. 

The function should be able to validate date strings correctly according to the problem statement.
