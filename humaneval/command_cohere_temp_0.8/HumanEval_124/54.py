Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
import re

def valid_date(date):
    """
    Validates a given date string and returns True if the date is valid, otherwise False.
    """
    if not date:
        return False
    match = re.match(r"^(\d\d?)[-/](\d\d?)[-/](\d\d\d\d)$", date)
    if match:
        day = int(match.group(2))
        month = int(match.group(1))
        year = int(match.group(3))
        if 1 <= month <= 12:
            if month == 2:
                if 1 <= day <= 29:
                    return True
                else:
                    return False
            elif month == 4 or month == 6 or month == 9 or month == 11:
                if 1 <= day <= 30:
                    return True
                else:
                    return False
            else:
                if 1 <= day <= 31:
                    return True
                else:
                    return False
        else:
            return False
    else:
        return False
```

The function takes a date as input and matches it against the date format mm-dd-yyyy. If the match is successful, it then checks if the day and month combinations return true for their respective ranges. The function returns True if all checks pass, and False otherwise. 
The code leverages the regex library to validate the date format and encapsulates the date validation into a single function, making it easy to reuse and maintain.  straightforward way, checking each condition separately and returning True or False depending on whether all conditions are satisfied.

Note: The code utilizes the RegEx library to validate the date format, assuming that the date string provides a valid date of the format "mm-dd-yyyy". However, if the date string does not respect this format, the validation will fail, even if the date is valid. Improving this code according to your specs is possible; just remember to make sure it caters to all edge cases.  Let me know if I can provide you with further insights or optimizations.
