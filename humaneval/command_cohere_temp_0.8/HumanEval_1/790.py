    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append(')')
            else:
                temp = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(temp)
                if not stack:
                    result.append((').extend(current_group)')
                elif char != ')':
                    stack.append(current_group)
                    current_group = []
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    if current_group:
        result.append(')'.join(current_group))
    
    return result
```

The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. When an open parentheses `(` is encountered, it adds an empty string to the stack. When a closing parentheses `)` is encountered, the algorithm checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it means an unbalanced closing parentheses `)` has been encountered, so it adds it to the result as is. If the stack is not empty, it pops the top item which is the current group, and adds it to the current string. The current string continues until another opening parentheses `(` is encountered. The process repeats until all the parentheses groups are processed. 

The script returns a list of strings, where each string corresponds to a balanced set of parentheses found in the input string. The overall time complexity of the algorithm to separate_paren_groups is O(N), where N is the number of characters in the input string. The algorithm has a linear time complexity due to the single loop that processes each character in the input string. The space complexity is O(N) as well, to store the current group and the stack.
