```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append('')
            elif not stack[-1]:
                result.append('')
            else:
                stack.pop()
                result.append(''.join(current_group))
                current_group = stack[-1]
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    if current_group:
        result.append(''.join(current_group))
    
    return result
```

The algorithm utilizes a stack to keep track of opening parentheses and a separate list to store the current group of parentheses. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the stack is checked to determine whether it corresponds to the last opened parenthesis. If so, the current group is added to the result list and the stack is popped to reset the groups. If not, the empty string is added to the result to separate the groups. After processing all characters, any remaining items in the current group are added to the result list.

The unit tests provided can be used to verify the correctness of the algorithm. These tests check various edge cases and intermediate steps to ensure that the function is correct and efficient.
