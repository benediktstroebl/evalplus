Here's a Python script that contains a function called `separate_paren_groups`, which takes a string of parentheses as input and returns a list of strings that represent each individual group of parentheses found in the input string. The code also includes a separate unit test function to verify the correctness of the `separate_paren_groups` function. Let's take a look at it:
```python
# Importing the necessary module
from typing import List

# The main function to be tested
def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
    separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
    Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
    Ignore any spaces in the input string.
    """
    # Using a stack to store parentheses groups
    stack = []
    current_group = ""

    # Iterating through each character in the input string
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            # If the character is an open parenthesis, add it to the current group
            current_group += char
        elif char == ')':
            # If the character is a closing parenthesis, add it to the current group if the current group is not empty
            if current_group:
                current_group += char
            else:
                # If the current group is empty, it means there are unbalanced parentheses, so we skip the closing parenthesis
                continue
        else:
            # If the character is not a parenthesis, it is necessarily a space, so we ignore it
            continue

        # If the current group is not empty, we add the current group to the stack
        if current_group:
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = ""

    # Finally, we add the last group to the stack if it is not empty
    if current_group:
        stack.append(current_group)

    # Returning the list of strings representing each group of parentheses
    return stack

# Unit tests
def test_separate_paren_groups():
    # Testing a specific input and expecting a specific output
    assert separate_paren_groups("( ) (( )) (( )( ))") == ['()', '(())', '(()())']

    # Testing another specific input and expecting a specific output
    assert separate_paren_groups("((a))") == ["(())", "(()())"]

    # Testing error handling for unbalanced parentheses
    try:
        separate_paren_groups("((")
        assert False, "The code should raise an error when encountering unbalanced parentheses"
    except ValueError:
        pass

# Running the tests
test_separate_paren_groups()
```

Let's break down the code step by step:
1. **Importing the `List` module**:
   The code starts by importing the `List` module from the `typing` module. This is unnecessary for the functionality of the `separate_paren_groups` function but is likely present to allow for type hints in the code.
2. **The `separate_paren_groups` function**:
   - This function takes a single argument, `paren_string`, which is the string containing nested parentheses that need to be separated.
   - It returns a list of strings, where each string represents a unique group of parentheses found in the input.
   - The function uses a stack data structure (represented as a list) to keep track of the open parentheses. Whenever an opening parenthesis '(' is encountered, it is added to the current group, and this group is appended to the stack. When a
