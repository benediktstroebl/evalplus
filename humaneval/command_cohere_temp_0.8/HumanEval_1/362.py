The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of the currently open parentheses and a list to store the currently balanced parentheses group. As it iterates through the input string, it checks whether each character is an opening or closing parenthesis. If it's an opening parenthesis, it pushes the current group onto the stack and starts a new group. If it's a closing parenthesis, it checks whether the stack is empty or not. If it's empty, it means there are mismatched parentheses, and the function returns an empty list. If it's not empty, the function checks whether the top element in the stack is empty or not. If it's not empty, it means the closing parenthesis belongs to the group on the top of the stack, so it pops the stack and appends the group to the result list. If it's empty, then the closing parenthesis closes the group that was pushed onto the stack earlier, so the function pops the stack, joins the group, and appends it to the result list. Finally, if there are any remaining open parentheses on the stack, the function handles them accordingly and returns the result list.
