```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                print(f"Unmatched ) detected: {char}")
                result.append(''.join(current_group))
                current_group = []
            else:
                current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    # Add the last group
    result.append(''.join(current_group))
    
    return result
```

The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of opening parentheses until it encounters a closing parenthesis. At that point, it checks if an opening parenthesis is at the top of the stack (i.e., the current group is not nested). If it is not, it outputs the current group and resets the group and stack. If it is, it pops the group off the stack, and continues appending characters to the group until it encounters another closing parenthesis. The output is a list of the separate group strings. 

This approach is designed to handle nested groups of parentheses in any depth, and correctly balances parentheses as described in the problem statement. It will also handle any string size, regardless of nesting complexity.
