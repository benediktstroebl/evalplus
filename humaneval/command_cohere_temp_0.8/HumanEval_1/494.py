```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return []
            current_group.append(char)
            if not stack[-1]:
                result.append(''.join(current_group))
                stack.pop()
            else:
                current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
            
    return result
```

This script utilizes a stack to keep track of nested paren groups. It iterates through the input string, appending opened parentheses to the stack and populating the `current_group` list with closed parentheses or any other characters. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, it checks whether the top of the stack is an empty list. If so, there are unbalanced parentheses, and we return an empty list. Otherwise, if the top of the stack is not empty, we know it corresponds to a closed parenthesis from a prior opened parenthesis, so we pop it and append the `current_group` to the result list. We repeat this process until the string is exhausted and thereby correctly separate nested paren groups from each other. 

This approach guarantees that unbalanced or nested groups are correctly handled. The output of the provided test case would be:
```bash
['()', '(())', '(()())']
``` 

Such a stack-based approach can be efficiently utilized for more complex bracket expressions, like the ones encountered in mathematical expressions.
