This Python script takes a string as input and returns a list of strings. Each string in the list represents a balanced group of nested parentheses found in the input string. The script uses a stack to keep track of the open parentheses until it encounters a close parenthesis. It then removes the open parentheses from the stack, joins the characters in between to form a string, and appends this string to the `result` list. This process continues until all groups are extracted from the input string and a list of balanced parenthesis groups is returned. 

This approach guarantees that groups are balanced and not nested within each other. Any spaces in the input string are ignored as per the instructions. 

The unit test based on the provided example input showcases how this function works by feeding it the input sentence and verifying that the expected output is returned, as follows:
```python
def test_separate_paren_groups():
    assert separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( ()( ))')) == ['()', '(())', '(()())']
```
