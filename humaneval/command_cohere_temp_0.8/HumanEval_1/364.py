This script employs a stack to manage the parentheses, similar to many solutions to the typical "catching balls in a basket" problem. It leverages the stack to keep track of properly opened parentheses and to ensure that no parentheses are missed or misappropriated. It also uses a list to store the current string sequence for a balanced set of parentheses. The result is a list of the separated string sequences. 

For example, given the input `((()))` it will produce the list `['()', '()']`.  This approach has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of characters in the input string and a space complexity of O(n) as it requires storing all characters in memory.
