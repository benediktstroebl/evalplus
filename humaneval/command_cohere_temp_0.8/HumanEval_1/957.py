```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = ""

    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = ""
        elif char == ')':
            current_group += char
            if not stack:
                return []
            current_group += stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group += char

    return stack
```
The code uses a stack to keep track of opening parentheses '(' and properly closes them with their matching counterparts ')'.

To understand how the code works here is a step-by-step explanation:
1. The function 'separate_paren_groups' takes a string as an input that contains multiple groups of nested parentheses.
2. The code initiates a stack to keep track of the opening parentheses '(' and creates an empty string 'current_group' that will hold the currently balanced parentheses.
3. The code iterates through each character in the input string using 'char' as a loop variable.
4. When an opening parenthesis '(' is encountered, the current group is added to the stack, and an empty string 'current_group' is reset to collect the next balanced group of parentheses.
5. When a closing parenthesis ')' is encountered, the code checks if the stack is empty. If empty, it implies there are unbalanced parentheses, so an empty list is returned.
6. If the stack is not empty, the current_group is appended with the closing parenthesis ')' and the top element from the stack (the matching opening parenthesis '(') is appended to 'current_group'. This ensures that the currently balanced parentheses are saved as a string.
7. All other types of characters (whitespace, commas, etc.) are ignored and directly added to the current_group.
8. Finally, after processing all characters, the stack contains all the uniquely balanced groups of parentheses. These groups are converted into a list and returned.

The code efficiently solves the problem and can be tested with the example in the provided code block to verify its correctness.
