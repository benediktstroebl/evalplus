The provided Python script defines a function `separate_paren_groups` that takes a string as input and returns a list of strings. This function is designed to handle nested parentheses in the input string by using a stack to keep track of open parentheses and correctly closing them as they appear.

Here's how the function works:
1. It initializes an empty list `stack` to store the open parentheses, an empty list `current_group` to store the current group of parentheses, and an empty list `result` to store the separated groups.
2. The function iterates through each character in the input `paren_string`. If the character is `'(''`, it pushes the current group (`current_group`) onto the stack and starts a new empty group. If the character is `')'`, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it's not empty, it pops the top item from the stack and appends it to the current group. This process effectively closes the current group and handles nested parentheses correctly. If the stack is empty, it means the current group is the last group, and it appends the contents of the current group to the `result` list.
3. For any other characters (anything else than `'('' and `')'`), the function simply appends them to the current group.
4. After processing all characters, the function checks if there are any remaining items in the stack. If there are, it means there were not enough closing parentheses, and it appends the remaining open parentheses to the result.

Overall, the function is designed to handle any number of nested parentheses and correctly separate them into individual groups, ensuring that each open parenthesis is properly closed before moving on to the next group. The output of the function is a list of strings, where each string represents a separate group of parentheses.
