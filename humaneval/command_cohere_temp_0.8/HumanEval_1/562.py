```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append(')')
            else:
                temp_group = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(temp_group)
                if not stack:
                    result.append(')'.join(current_group))
                current_group = temp_group
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    return result
```

The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the stack is checked to determine whether it corresponds to an open parenthesis in the current group or a different group. If it matches the current group, it is added to that group and the stack is checked for the corresponding opening parenthesis of the next group. If it doesn't match the current group, the stack is popped and added to the current group. This process continues until all the parentheses are processed. The resulting list of strings is returned, with each string corresponding to a balanced group of parentheses.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))'))
```
```
output['''()', '(())', '(()())']
```
