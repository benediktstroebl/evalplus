This Python script takes a string as input and returns a list of strings. Each string in the list represents a balanced group of parentheses found in the input string. The script uses a stack to keep track of the open parentheses and a list to store the current group of parentheses.

It iterates through each character of the input string, if it encounters an open parenthesis `(`, it pushes the current group onto the stack and starts a new empty group. When it encounters a closing parenthesis `)`, it checks if the current group is empty. If so, it adds an empty string to the result list to account for the unbalanced closing parenthesis. If the current group is not empty, it pops the top item from the stack, appends the closing parenthesis to the current group, and checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it adds the current group to the result list. The process continues until all characters have been processed.

The script ensures that parentheses are properly balanced, nested groups are separated, and spaces are ignored.

Feel free to test it using:
```bash
python
>>> separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')
['()', '(())', '(()())']
``` 
It should return a list containing three strings, representing the different groups of parentheses found in the input string. Each string in the list is balanced and properly nested.
