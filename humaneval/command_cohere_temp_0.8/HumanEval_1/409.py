```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = ""

    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = ""
        elif char == ')':
            current_group += char
            if not stack:
                return []
            top_group = stack.pop()
            if not stack:
                result.append(top_group)
            else:
                stack[-1] += top_group
        else:
            current_group += char

    return result
```

The code uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, it is appended to the current group and the stack is checked for a corresponding opening parenthesis. If there is one, the group is added to the list of results and the stack is checked for more nested groups. If there isn't one, the group is appended to the most recent group on the stack and the process continues. The resulting list contains all the unique nested parentheses groups with their internal parentheses balanced but without any nesting within each other.
