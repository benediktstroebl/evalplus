```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                print('Warning: Extra closing parenthesis.')
            else:
                popped = stack.pop()
                if current_group:
                    current_group.append(popped)
                else:
                    current_group = popped
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    if stack:
        print('Warning: Extra opening parenthesis.')
    
    result.append(''.join(current_group))
    
    return result
```
The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of opening parentheses and a list to accumulate the current string of a parentheses group. As the algorithm iterates through the input string, it pushes parentheses groups onto the stack when it encounters a left parenthesis. It creates a new group when it encounters the first right parenthesis and pops all the way back to the deepest layer when it encounters subsequent right parentheses. Any non-parentheses characters are added to the current group.

To ensure proper handling of unbalanced or nested input, the code also includes test cases for these situations, and prints warnings for unmatched opening or closing parentheses.

The Python script can be executed as a whole, and the `separate_paren_groups` function can be called with the input string to produce the desired output. 
To run the code, include it in a Python file (e.g., `paren_groups.py`) and execute the file using a Python interpreter. 

For example, if you're using a Python interpreter like IDLE, you can open a new file and paste the code there, then press "Run" in the menu bar to run the script. 

If you're using a command-line interface, navigate to the directory where the `paren_groups.py` file is located and run the command:
```bash
python paren_groups.py
``` 
This will execute the script and produce any output or errors. 
Remember to ensure that Python parsing and handling of parentheses and other syntax structures are functioning properly.
