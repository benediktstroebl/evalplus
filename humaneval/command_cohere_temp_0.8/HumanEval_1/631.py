Here's a Python script that contains a function called `separate_paren_groups`, which takes a string of parentheses as input and returns a list of strings that represent each individual group of parentheses. The code is formatted with Markdown code blocks to adhere to the problem you've described:
```python
# Initialize the Python interpreter
import reprint as rep

# Import the List module and other relevant modules
from typing import List


# Define the function that takes a string of parentheses as input and returns a list of strings.
def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    open_braces = '('
    close_braces = ')'
    output: List[str] = []
    stack: List = []

    # Iterate through each character in the input string
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == open_braces:
            # If the character is an open brace, add it to the stack
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == close_braces and stack:
            # If the character is a close brace and there are elements on the stack,
            # add the top item to the output string and remove it from the stack
            output.append("".join(stack))
            stack.pop()
        elif not stack:
            # If the string contains an unbalanced close brace, add it to the output string
            output.append(char)
    # Add the remaining elements in the stack to the output string if any
    while stack:
        output.append("".join(stack))
        stack.pop()

    # Return the list of strings representing each group of parentheses
    return output


# Example test case
test_string = '''( ) (( )) (( )( ))'''
expected_output = ['()', '(())', '(()())']

# Test the function with the test case; the output should be the expected output
print(f">>> separate_paren_groups('{test_string}') = {expected_output}")
print(f">>> Result: {separate_paren_groups(test_string)}")
```

The `separate_paren_groups` function disregards spaces within the input string and processes only the parentheses, splitting them into separate groups. The test case demonstrates its expected output. The function incorporates an `if-elif-else` structure for iteration through the input string's characters.

During this process, opening parentheses are pushed onto the stack, while closing parentheses are popped from the stack. The remaining items in the stack, if any, are combined to form a single string. Ultimately, the function returns a list consisting of each individual group of parentheses, separated by spaces, in the order they appear in the input string.
