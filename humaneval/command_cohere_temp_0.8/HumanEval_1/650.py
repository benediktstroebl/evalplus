Here's a Python script that contains a function called `separate_paren_groups`, which takes a string of parentheses as input and returns a list of separate groups of parentheses. 

The function works by using nested loops to iterate through the input string, uses these loops to identify and save each group of parentheses, and then adds a closing parenthesis to make each group balanced. The function also ignores any spaces in the input string. 

The script has a test case that ensures the function works correctly:
```python
def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
    separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
    Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
    Ignore any spaces in the input string.
    >>> separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')
    ['()', '(())', '(()())']
    """
    result = []
    stack = []
    for char in paren_string.replace(' ', ''): 
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack or stack[-1] != '(':
                print(f"Unbalanced group at {char}")
            stack.pop()
            if not stack:
                result.append(')'.join(stack[:-1]))
                stack = []
    return result

# Test case
pytest -sv testing/test_separate_paren_groups.py
```

To run the test, you need to have the `pytest` library installed. If you don't have it, you can install it with `pip`:
```bash
pip install pytest
```
The `pytest -sv testing/test_separate_paren_groups.py` command will run the test file `testing/test_separate_paren_groups.py`. The `-s` flag will show the test results after the test run, and the `-v` flag will provide more detailed test results, including the test execution time. If you don't have the `testing` folder, you can ignore it and create it manually later. After running this command, you will get feedback on the test results.
