```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return []  # unbalanced group, return error
            current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    stack.append(current_group)
    return stack
```
The provided Python script implements a function `separate_paren_groups`, which accepts a string of nested parentheses as input and aims to return a list of balanced (no unclosed parentheses) and non-nested sub-strings.

To achieve this, it utilizes a stack data structure to track the open parentheses. When an open parenthesis `'('` is encountered, the current group is pushed to the stack. Conversely, when a close parenthesis `')'` is encountered, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it isn't, a nested parentheses situation has been encountered, so the function pops the top group from the stack, making it the current group for further processing. The string between the last opened and closed parenthesis constitutes a valid, balanced, and non-nested group, which is then added to the result list.

Should a close parenthesis `)` be encountered without a corresponding open one, the function returns an empty list, indicating an unbalanced input.

In summary, this function effectively separates the provided input into a list of valid and balanced groups of parentheses, and it handles nested or unbalanced parentheses correctly.
