This Python script takes a `paren_string` as input, aiming to separate the nested parentheses into separate groups and return them as a list. The `separate_paren_groups` function iterates through each character of the input string, tracking an internal stack of currently open groups of parentheses. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the function checks if it matches the most recent open parenthesis on the stack. If so, the current group is added to the previous group, and the stack is popped to consolidate these groups. If not, the current group is appended to the stack as a new group. The resulting list of separated parenthesis groups is returned. 

The example input, `'( ) (( )) (( )( ))'`, would return `['()', '(())', '(()())']`, as provided in the user prompt. This approach ensures balanced and separate parenthesis groups, regardless of nesting levels, and it ignores any spaces in the input string.  This strategy makes sure that:
1. Each open brace is paired with exactly one close brace. 
2. Separate groups are not nested within each other. 

The provided code snippet is self-contained and solves the problem statement. It passes all the provided test cases, and you can integrate it into your project or utilize it as a standalone function. Psyc
