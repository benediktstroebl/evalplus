This script uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. It checks the input string character by character, assigning any opening parentheses to the current group and any closing parentheses to their corresponding opening parentheses. It also handles the case where there are more closing parentheses than opening ones by keeping track of the balance using the `stack`. The resulting list of strings is then returned if any, or a list containing `None` if the input string is empty. 

This solution corresponds to the provided test case and handles proper nesting, balancing, and spacing as specified in the problem. 
The code includes a test case to check for an unbalanced parenthesis sequence. 
This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, since each character is iterated and processed once. It also has a space complexity of O(n), due to the stack of brackets and list of characters within each group.
