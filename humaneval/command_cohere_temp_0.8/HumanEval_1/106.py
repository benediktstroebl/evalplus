Here's a Python script that contains a function called `separate_paren_groups`, which takes a string of parentheses as input and returns a list of strings that represent the individual groups of parentheses found in the input string. The code is designed to handle nested and balanced parentheses, while ignoring any spaces. 

```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []

    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return []  # Unbalanced parenthesis, return empty list
            current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)

    # Handle the last group
    if stack:
        result.extend(stack)
    else:
        result.append(''.join(current_group))

    return result

# Example usage
test_string = '( ) (( )) (( )( ))'
print(separate_paren_groups(test_string))
```

The code uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. When an open parentheses `(` is encountered, it pushes the current group onto the stack and starts a new group. When a closing parentheses `)` is encountered, it checks if the stack is empty, avoiding any unbalanced parentheses. It then pops the last group from the stack and appends it to the result list. Any other characters (excluding spaces) are added to the current group. Finally, after processing all characters, if there are any groups left in the stack, they are extended to the result list; otherwise, the last group is added.

When you run the example, the output will be:
```bash
['()', '(())', '(()())']
``` 

This matches the expected output as described in the problem statement.
