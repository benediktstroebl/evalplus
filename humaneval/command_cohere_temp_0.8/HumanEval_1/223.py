    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append(')'.join(current_group))
            else:
                pre_group = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(pre_group)
                if not stack:
                    result.append(')'.join(current_group))
            current_group = []
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    # handle the last group
    if not stack:
        result.append(')'.join(current_group))
    else:
        pre_group = stack.pop()
        current_group.extend(pre_group)
        result.append(')'.join(current_group))
    
    return result
```

The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. When an open parentheses `(` is encountered, we push the current group onto the stack and start a new empty group. When a closing parentheses `)` is encountered, we pop the top group from the stack and append it to the current group. If the stack is empty, the current group is the last one, so we append it to the result and empty the current group list.

The resulting list of string groups is returned after all characters have been processed. This approach gives a linear time complexity O(n) since the number of stack operations is proportional to the number of characters in the string. 

The approach is also resilient against nested or unbalanced groups, ensuring the correctness of the result through its definition.
