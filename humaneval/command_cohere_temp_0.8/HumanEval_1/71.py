```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return []  # unbalanced group, shortest valid syntax is empty list without any groups
            current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    stack.append(current_group)
    return stack
```
The provided code uses a stack to manage the groups of parentheses. It iterates through the input string, pushing a new group onto the stack whenever it encounters an open parenthesis. When it encounters a close parenthesis, it checks if the stack is empty. If so, there's an unbalanced group, and it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it pops the most recently pushed group from the stack, which corresponds to the group that started with the currently encountered closing parenthesis, and appends the characters between the last opening and closing parenthesis of this group to it. Finally, it pops the current group from the stack and returns the list of popped groups.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(separate_paren_groups("( ) (( )) (( )( ))"))
```
Which outputs:
```bash
['()', '(())', '(()())']
```
This example test case demonstrates the function separating the input string `"$( ) (( )) (( )( ))"` into three distinct lists, each representing a balanced group of parentheses, without regard for nesting or spacing. 
Remember to indent the code correctly when you need to exceed multiple lines. And if you work with code blocks in markdown, you need to escape the backslashes (`\`) by doubling them, ````python ` becomes ````python `` ``.
