Here's a Python script that contains a function called `separate_paren_groups` that accepts a string consisting of multiple groups of parentheses and returns a list of those groups, appropriately balanced and separated:
```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []

    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return []  # Unbalanced group, returning empty list as an indication
            current_group.pop()
            stack.pop()
            if not stack:
                result.append(')'.join(current_group))
            elif current_group:
                stack[-1].append(')'.join(current_group))
        else:
            current_group.append(char)

    return result

# Example usage
test_string = '( ) (( )) (( )( ))'
print(separate_paren_groups(test_string))
```
This script provides the function `separate_paren_groups` as per the problem statement. It uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups and iterates through the characters of the input string.

When it encounters an open parenthesis `(`, it pushes the current group (`current_group`) onto the stack and resets `current_group` to an empty list to start a new group. When it encounters a close parenthesis `)`, it checks if the stack is empty. If it isn't, that means we have a balanced group to add to the result or the previous group (`stack[-1]`). If `current_group` has any content, we concatenate everything with a closing parenthesis `)` and add that to the previous group. Otherwise, we simply pop the top of the stack (the group we opened last), and if it's empty, it means we have an unbalanced group, in which case we return an empty list as an indication of failure.

The example usage provided shows a sample input string and the resulting output of the function. 

This approach ensures that each open parenthesis has a matching close parenthesis, and all groups are correctly separated and returned. It also handles potential nested or unbalanced groups correctly.
