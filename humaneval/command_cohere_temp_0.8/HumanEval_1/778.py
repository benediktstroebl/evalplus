The code uses a stack to track the nested depth of each group. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the code checks whether it matches the most recent open parenthesis on the stack. If so, the stack is popped and the current group is yielded. If not, the most recent group is yielded and the stack is popped while the unmatched closing parenthesis is saved in `current_group` for pairing with the next incoming open parenthesis.

The `separate_groups` function is used to manage the case where an unbalanced opening parenthesis is encountered. It appends the next group to the previous one and checks if the result is a valid group. If it's not a valid group or an opening parenthesis, it yields the partial result and keeps the closing parenthesis for pairing. If it's a valid group, it is yielded and the closing parenthesis is discarded. This way, all groups are properly separated and yielded.
