```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return []  # unbalanced group, returning empty list as result
            current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    if stack:
        return []  # unbalanced groups, returning empty list
    
    result.append(''.join(current_group))
    
    return result
```
The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of open parentheses `(` and builds resulting strings on the stack. It also checks for an unbalanced group and returns an empty list if there is any.

The markdown code block above contains a self-contained Python script that defines a function `separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:` that accepts a string of parentheses and returns a list of strings corresponding to the balanced groups of parentheses. The function utilizes a stack to manage the parentheses and overcome nested or unbalanced scenarios.

This solution works for nested and unbalanced parentheses as long as there are no overlaps in the nesting. It simply collects characters between opening and closing parentheses and gives the collected strings.
