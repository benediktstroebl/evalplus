This script uses a stack to keep track of open parentheses and creates a corresponding list of strings, where each string represents a separate group of parentheses. It iterates through the input string and performs the following steps:
1. When encountering an open parenthesis `(`, we push the current group (if any) to the stack and start a new group.
2. When encountering a closing parenthesis `)`, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, then we yield the current group, as it represents a balanced group of parentheses. If the stack is not empty, we check if the top element on the stack matches the current group. If it does, then we pop it from the stack and continue with the current group. If it doesn't, then we pop the top element and yield it as a separate group, then continue with the current group.
3. For any other characters (e.g., `Space`), we simply append them to the current group. 

After processing all characters, it may optionally yield any remaining groups left in the stack, these would be unbalanced or nested groups. 

The approach is quite efficient, as it uses a stack to keep track of open parentheses and processes characters one by one. Hence, the time complexity is `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input string.
