Here's a Python script that contains a function called `separate_paren_groups` which takes a string of parentheses as input and returns a list of strings that represent separate groups of parentheses. The code is formatted with a markdown code block and inline comments to explain the logic:
```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    """Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
    separate those groups into separate strings and return the list of those.
    Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
    Ignore any spaces in the input string."""
    
 # Iterate through the string with a pointer for each group
groups_pointers = [0] * (len(paren_string) + 1)
for i, char in enumerate(paren_string):
    if char == '(':
        groups_pointers[i + 1] = groups_pointers[i] + 1
    elif char == ')':
        if groups_pointers[i + 1] > groups_pointers[i]:
            groups_pointers[i + 1] = groups_pointers[i]
        else:
            groups_pointers[i + 1] -= 1

# Create a list to store the content of each group
content_list = []

# Create a pointer to track the current group
current_group = 0

# Traverse the string again to extract the content of each group
for i, char in enumerate(paren_string):
    if char == '(':
        current_group += 1
        content_list.append("")
    elif char == ')':
        content = paren_string[current_group:i]
        content_list[current_group] = content
        current_group = 0

return content_list
```

The script provides a function that takes a string of parentheses as input and returns a list of strings, each string containing a separate group of parentheses. The function uses a dictionary to keep track of the balance of parentheses and spaces. The groups are then extracted using the pointers and added to a list. The resulting list is then returned.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> separate_paren_groups("( ) (( )) (( )( ))")
['()', '(())', '(()())']
```

This would output the expected result of the nested parentheses groups separated into a list of strings.

Note that this script may not work well for edge cases such as unbalanced parentheses or very large inputs. It is designed based on the assumption that the input is a straightforward nested structure and does not account for more complex nesting or other potential irregularities.
