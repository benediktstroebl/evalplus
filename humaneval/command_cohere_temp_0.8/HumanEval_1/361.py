                temp_group = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(temp_group)
                if not stack:
                    result.append(')'.join(current_group))
                    current_group = []
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
            
    # Add the last group
    if not stack:
        result.append(')'.join(current_group))

The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of opening parentheses until it encounters a closing parenthesis. Then it checks if the closing parenthesis has a corresponding opening parenthesis on the stack (meaning it's the end of a group). The contents of the group are extracted, and the group is added to the results list. The algorithm continues this process until it has processed all characters in the input string.

The script includes a test case that validates the function against an example string, demonstrating its behavior. The test is written using the `>>> ` syntax, which is used to indicate an interactive Python session. The syntax is also used in the problem statement you provided, which is a common way to provide test cases in Python tutorials and documentation.
