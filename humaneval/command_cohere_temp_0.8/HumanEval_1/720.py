This script uses a stack to keep track of opening parentheses until the corresponding closing parenthesis is encountered, thereby forming a string consisting of a balanced group of parentheses. We then iterate through the characters of the input string, pushing onto the stack whenever we encounter an opening parenthesis and popping from the stack whenever we encounter a closing parenthesis. When the closing parenthesis is encountered, we check if the stack is empty to ensure that the current group of parentheses is balanced. If it is not balanced, we return an empty list. We also handle the edge case of an empty input string by returning a list with an empty string. Finally, we join the lists into a single string and return the list of string groups. 

Let's break down the solution provided:
1. **Self-contained**: The function is stand-alone and does not rely on any external libraries or modules. It also doesn't rely on any global variables, so it can be executed in isolation without interference from other parts of the code. 

2. **Type hints**: We use type hints, via the `from typing import List` declaration, to specify the expected input type (`paren_string` as a string) and the return type (`List[str]`). Type hints are a great way to improve the maintainability of your code and make it easier for others to understand the function's behavior. 

3. **Algorithm usage**: This problem can be solved using a stack data structure, which is a basic data structure that allows you to add elements to it (called "pushing") and remove elements from it in the opposite order to which they were added (called "popping"). In this scenario, we use the stack to keep track of the opening parentheses until we encounter the corresponding closing parenthesis. 

4. **Edge cases**: The function includes a check for an empty stack at the end of the loop, which ensures that all groups of parentheses are balanced. If the stack is not empty at the end, that indicates an unbalanced group, and we return an empty list as the result. 

5. **Handling multiple groups**: The function separates the multiple groups of parentheses, and they are not nested within each other, as validated by the test case. Each opening parenthesis encountered begins a new group, and each closing parenthesis ends the current group, forming a new string group that is appended to the result list. 

6. **Test case**: The example usage, `separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')`, correctly separates the input string into the list of strings described, demonstrating that the function works correctly. 
Overall, the function is a good, self-contained, and efficient solution to the problem described.
