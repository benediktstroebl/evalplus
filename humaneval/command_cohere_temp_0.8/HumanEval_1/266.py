```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return []  # unbalanced group, return an empty list
            current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    if stack:
        return []  # unbalanced group, return an empty list
    else:
        result.append(''.join(current_group))
    
    return result
```
The provided Python script completes the task of separating inputted nested parentheses into individual strings as described in the problem statement. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets until it encounters a closing one, at which point it checks if the current group is balanced before adding it to the result list. The solution also accounts for potential unbalanced or nested groups, returning an empty list in such cases.
