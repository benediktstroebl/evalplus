```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return []  # unbalanced group, return error
            current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    stack.append(current_group)
    return stack
```
The provided Python script defines a function `separate_paren_groups` that takes a string as input and returns a list of strings. This function is designed to process a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses, separating them into individual strings within a list. It achieves this by utilizing a stack data structure and iterating through the input string character by character.

When it encounters an open parenthesis `(`, it pushes the current group (stored in `current_group`) onto the stack. When it encounters a closing parenthesis `)`, it checks if the stack is empty. If it's not, there is an unbalanced group, and the function returns an empty list as an error indication. Otherwise, it pops the top group from the stack, which represents the closest matching open parenthesis, and appends it to the `current_group`. Any non-parentheses characters are directly appended to `current_group`.

Finally, after processing all characters, it pushes the last group (if any) onto the stack and returns the stack containing all the separated groups as a list.

In essence, the script provides a concise and functional solution to the problem of separating nested parentheses into individual groups while handling potential imbalances gracefully.
