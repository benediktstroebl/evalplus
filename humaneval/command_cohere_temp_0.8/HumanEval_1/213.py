```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = ""
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = ""
        elif char == ')':
            current_group += char
            if not stack:
                yield current_group
            elif stack[-1] == "":
                stack.pop()
            else:
                current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group += char
    
    # yield any remaining groups in the stack
    while stack:
        yield stack.pop()
```

The algorithm utilizes a stack to keep track of the currently opened group. When an open parentheses `(` is encountered, we append the current group to the stack and start a new group. Upon encountering a closing parentheses `)`, we check the stack. If it's empty, we yield the current group, if the last group in the stack is an empty string, we pop it off the stack and assign it to `current_group`, indicating we've closed the most recently opened group. If the stack isn't empty and the last group isn't an empty string, we pop the top group off the stack and assign it to `current_group`, signifying we've opened a new group. The final groups are yielded when all closing parentheses have been encountered and any remaining groups are in the stack.

The `else` block simply appends any other character to the `current_group` as it isn't concerned with balancing or nesting.

This approach guarantees that each opened group is properly closed and not nested within another group. 

> **NOTE**: One limitation of this approach is its inability to handle nested groups correctly. Considering the complexity of correctly handling nested groups, it's advisable to maintain a straightforward approach without sacrificing too much readability and efficiency. If you anticipate frequent nested groups, consider alternative methods or optimizations.
