def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return []
            current_group.append(char)
            if not stack[-1]:
                result.append(''.join(current_group))
                stack.pop()
            else:
                current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
            
    return result
```

The algorithm utilizes a stack to keep track of open parentheses `(` and creates a corresponding list `current_group` to capture closed parentheses `)`. The code iterates through each character in the input string. When an open parenthesis is encountered, it pushes the current group onto the stack. When a closed parenthesis is encountered, the code checks if the stack is empty or if the top element in the stack is complete (i.e., a string with no open parentheses). If either condition is met, an empty list is returned. If the stack contains a group with open parentheses, the current group is appended to it, and its status is updated. Otherwise, the current group is appended to the result list, and the corresponding open group is popped from the stack. The process ensures that all groups of parentheses are correctly separated and returned.
