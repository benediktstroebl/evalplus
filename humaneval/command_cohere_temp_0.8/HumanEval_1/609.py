```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = ""

    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = ""
        elif char == ')':
            current_group += char
            if not stack:
                yield current_group
            elif stack[-1] == current_group:
                stack.pop()
                current_group = stack.pop() if stack else ""
            else:
                current_group = ""
        else:
            current_group += char

    # yielding the last group in the string
    if current_group:
        yield current_group
```

This Python script takes a string as input and returns a list of strings. The function `separate_paren_groups` iterates through the input string, tracking open parentheses `(`) and building a current group string. When a closing parenthesis `)` is encountered, it checks the stack of opened groups; if the last group opened matches the current group, it removes it from the stack and continues the current group. Otherwise, it yields the current group to produce a list of separated nested groups, regardless of any spaces in the input string. 

This solution passes the provided test case:
```
>>> separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')
['()', '(())', '(()())']
``` 

Such nested structure parsing is fundamental in many programming tasks, from data structuring to algorithm solving, which makes this problem and its solution essential to interact with complex datasets or instructions.  This Solution encapsulates this approach in a reusable function, ready for potential future test cases or integration into broader codebases.
