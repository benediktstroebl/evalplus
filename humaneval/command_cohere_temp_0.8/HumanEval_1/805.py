```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                print(f"Invalid input - extra closing brace: {char}")
                return []
            current_group.append(char)
            if not stack[-1]:
                result.append(''.join(current_group))
                stack.pop()
            else:
                current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
            
    # handle the last group
    if stack:
        print(f"Invalid input - missing closing brace!")
        return []
    else:
        result.append(''.join(current_group))

The provided Python script completes the task through the following steps:
1. Using a stack to keep track of opening parentheses, it iterates through the input string.
2. Each opening parenthesis encountered pushes the current group onto the stack and starts a new group.
3. Each closing parenthesis introduces an extension to the current group or closes it. If the top of the stack is empty, an extra closing parenthesis is detected. In case the stack is not empty and the last group is not empty, the current group is popped from the stack and added to the result. Otherwise, the closing parenthesis is dropped to handle nested parentheses correctly. 
4. The final group is handled similarly to the previous iteration steps, and any remaining opening parentheses are considered extra.

The script handles nested and unbalanced parentheses and returns a list of separate strings without any spacing. Sample test cases are provided in the original problem statement.
