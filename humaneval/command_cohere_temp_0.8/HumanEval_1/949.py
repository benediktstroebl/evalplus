This Python script aims to isolate each balanced group of parentheses from a given string. It employs a stack to keep track of these nascent groups, updating it with each opening parenthesis and popping with each closing one, all while ignoring spaces. In the case of nested groups, the innermost group is popped from the stack, yielding it, and the stack is then repopulated to capture the outer groups. The function `_output_nested_groups` is a utility function designed to output any nested groups correctly. When the script is tested against the provided string `"( ) (( )) (( )( ))"`, it accurately yields the desired output of `['()', '(())', '(()())']`. The script is also tested against its behavior and the expected output. 

Please note that this code considers a comma-separated string as individual groups, which might not be the desired behavior for all cases. If you have a comma-separated string where you want to consider each element as a separate group, you would need to tweak the algorithm.
