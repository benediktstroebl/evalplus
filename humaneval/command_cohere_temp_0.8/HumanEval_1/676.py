This Python script corrects some edge cases that might have been missed in the initial implementation. 

The function `separate_paren_groups_hypothetical_further_corrected` goes through each character in the input string. If the character is an open parenthesis `(`, the function checks if the current group is balanced (i.e., if the last added group is closed). If it is balanced, the current group is yielded and the next group starts with an empty string. If it is not balanced, the open parenthesis is added to the current group. 

The function handles closing parenthesis `)` similarly: it appends it to the current group. If the current group is balanced, it is yielded and the next group starts with an empty string. If the current group is not balanced (i.e., there are more closing parentheses than opening ones) it restores the balance by adding the proper open parentheses to the current group and yielding it. The function uses a stack to keep track of the balance of each group.
