```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []

    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append(')'.join(current_group))
            else:
                temp = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(temp)
        else:
            current_group.append(char)

    if not stack:
        result.append(')'.join(current_group))
    else:
        while stack:
            temp = stack.pop()
            current_group.extend(temp)
        result.append(')'.join(current_group))

    return result
```

The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of opening parentheses until it encounters a closing parenthesis. Then it checks if an open parenthesis is the last element of the stack, which signifies the beginning of a new group, and hence a new string is started to be appended to the `result` list. If the closing parenthesis is not the last element of the stack, it signifies it is part of a previously started group, and its contents are appended to the currently building group string. This process ensures that unbalanced or nested groups are handled correctly. The resulting list of strings constitutes the returned result.
