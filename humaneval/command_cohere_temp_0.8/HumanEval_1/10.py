```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append(''.join(current_group))
            else:
                pre_group = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(pre_group)
                if not stack:
                    result.append(''.join(current_group))
            current_group = []
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    return result
```

The algorithm uses a stack to track open parentheses and collects closed parentheses in `current_group`. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the stack is checked. If the stack is empty, the current group is added to the result list. If the stack is not empty, the top element of the stack (the last open bracket) is appended to the current group, and the stack is popped. This ensures that parentheses groups are properly balanced and not nested within each other. 

The resulting list of string representations of the parentheses groups is then returned.
