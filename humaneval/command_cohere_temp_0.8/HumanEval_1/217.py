```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = ""
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = ""
        elif char == ')':
            current_group += char
            if not stack:
                return []
            top_group = stack.pop()
            if not stack:
                result.append(top_group)
            else:
                stack[-1] += top_group
        else:
            current_group += char
    
    return result
```
The code uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, it is added to the current group and the top of the stack is checked. If the stack is empty, then the current group is the last one and it is added to the results. If there are more groups to process, the top group is taken off the stack, checked if it is finished, and added to the results if so. The process continues until all parentheses groups are processed. This ensures that no groups are nested and that all groups are properly balanced. The final list of separated groups is returned.
