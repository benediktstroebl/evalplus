This script uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. It iterates through the input string, adding opened parentheses to the stack and accumulating a `current_group` of parentheses. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the script checks if it has a matching opened parenthesis on the stack, and if so, it adds the closed parenthesis to the `current_group` and pops the opened parenthesis from the stack. If there are no more opened parentheses on the stack, the group is added to the results list, and the process continues with the next group. Unmatched parentheses are handled by printing a message and iterating through the loop. 

This approach guarantees that groups are balanced and correctly separated, regardless of their nesting level. 

Note: this approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, and a space complexity of O(k), where k is the maximum number of nested groups, since we use a stack to keep track of the current group of parentheses.
