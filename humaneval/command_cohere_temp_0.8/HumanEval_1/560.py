```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return []  # unbalanced group, returning empty list as convention
            current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    stack.append(current_group)
    return stack
```
The provided code uses a stack to properly separate the parentheses groups. It also avoids issues with unmatched parentheses by checking if the stack is empty when a ')' is encountered and properly handling the empty stack case. The output will be a list of lists, where each inner list corresponds to a valid expression inside parentheses, excluding any spaces. 
This approach handles nested and nested-and-nested groups as well, provided the logic isn't modified.
