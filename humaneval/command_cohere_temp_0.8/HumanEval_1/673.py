The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of opening parentheses until it receives a matching closing parenthesis. This ensures that we correctly identify and separate groups of parentheses that are nested within each other. Let's interpret the code step by step and apply it to the test case provided in the problem statement:
Given the input string: `( ) (( )) (( )( ))`

1. Loop Through Each Character in the Input String:
The loop iterates over each character in the input string `paren_string`.
- '(': Every opening parenthesis is pushed onto the stack (which initially is empty) and also added to the current group. The current group is the sequence of parentheses between the last closing parenthesis and the current opening parenthesis. Since the stack is empty initially and this is the first opening parenthesis, the first opening parenthesis is added to the current group but not to the stack.
- ')'': Every closing parenthesis is matched with the most recent opening parenthesis (LIFO) on the top of the stack. If there is no opening parenthesis on the stack, it means there are unbalanced closing parentheses, and the function returns an empty list (the input is invalid).
- Any other character (space in this case): It is added to the current group.

2. Handling Balanced Parentheses:
The algorithm continues this process until the entire input string has been processed. At this point, the stack will contain nested groups of opening parentheses. Each time an opening parenthesis is pushed onto the stack, it starts a new group of parentheses.

3. Pop the Stack to Get the Separate Groups:
After processing the entire input string, the stack contains the separate groups of parentheses. The algorithm pops the stack to retrieve these groups and returns them as a list.

4. Test Case:
The provided test case is `( ) (( )) (( )( ))`. The algorithm processes each character as follows:
- '(': The stack is empty, so the first opening parenthesis starts a new group. It is added to the current group (an empty string at this point) and also pushed onto the stack.
- ' ')': The current group accumulates the closing parenthesis. Since the stack is not empty, we know that this closing parenthesis matches the most recent opening parenthesis on the stack. The current group is now '()'.
- '(': The next opening parenthesis starts a new group. It is added to the current group (()) and pushed onto the stack.
- '(': The next opening parenthesis also starts a new group. Since the stack is not empty, this opening parenthesis is added to the current group (()) and pushed onto the stack. The current group is now ('()').
- ')'': The current group accumulates the closing parenthesis. The stack is not empty, so this closing parenthesis matches the most recent opening parenthesis on the stack. The current group is now ('()').
- ')'': The next closing parenthesis is accumulated in the current group. The stack is not empty, so this closing parenthesis matches the most recent opening parenthesis on the stack.
