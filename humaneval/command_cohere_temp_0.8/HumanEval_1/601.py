            current_group = []
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    # Handle the last group
    if not stack:
        result.append(')'.join(current_group))
    else:
        pre_group = stack.pop()

```

The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. It shifts every opening parenthesis to the stack and collects all characters between them into `current_group`. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the stack is checked. If it is empty, the current group is considered the last one and is added to `result`. If there are elements in the stack, the topmost one (the previous group) is popped and appended to the current group. The process is repeated until all input is processed.
