This script uses a stack to keep track of open parentheses `(` and uses a separate string `current_group` to build the
current string between parentheses. When it encounters a closing parenthesis `)`, it checks whether the stack is empty;
if so, it yields the `current_group` as a valid string with balanced parentheses. If there are open parentheses
remaining on the stack, it checks if the last element on the stack matches the current group; if so, it pops them
both off the stack and resets `current_group` to the previous group. If neither of these conditions is met, it
indicates that there are unbalanced parentheses, and it resets `current_group` to empty. Finally, after processing
the string, it yields any remaining groups that were on the stack, as these are the last balanced parentheses
sequences in the string. This strategy allows the program to correctly separate groups of parentheses.
