```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append(')')
            else:
                temp = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(temp)
                if not stack:
                    result.append((').extend(').join(current_group))
                else:
                    current_group = []
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    if current_group:
        stack.append(current_group)
    return result
```

The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the stack is checked to see if it contains an accompanying opening parenthesis. If it does, the current group is added to the last element of the stack (which represents the outermost group), and the stack is popped to complete the current group. If the stack is empty, the current group is added to the result as-is (since there are no nested groups to separate it from).

This approach ensures that each separate group of parentheses is balanced and returned as a single string, without any nesting or spacing issues. The final list of separated groups is then returned by the function.
