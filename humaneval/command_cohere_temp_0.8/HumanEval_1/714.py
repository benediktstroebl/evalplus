```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return ['Unbalanced parentheses in input!']
            current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    stack.append(current_group)
    return stack
```
The code uses a stack to keep track of opening parentheses '('. When a closing parenthesis ')' is encountered, the stack is checked to ensure that an opening parenthesis '(' is present at the top of the stack. If so, the current group is added to the result list, and the stack is popped to reset the state. Otherwise, an error is returned since it indicates unbalanced parentheses. The result list is returned after all iterations of the input string. 
This approach guarantees that groups of parentheses are properly separated and balanced. 
The code is encapsulated in a self-contained function that handles the state and returns a list of separated groups, making it modular and easy to test.
