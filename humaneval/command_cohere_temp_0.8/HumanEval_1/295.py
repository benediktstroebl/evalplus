The provided Python script completes the task of separating nested parentheses into separate groups, fulfilling the problem statement and passing the given tests. Here's how it works:
1. The `separate_paren_groups` function takes a single argument, `paren_string`, which is the input string containing nested parentheses.
2. The function utilizes a stack to keep track of opening parentheses and a separate string, `current_group`, to build up the currently formed group of parentheses.
3. It iterates through each character in the input string, and for opening parentheses ('('), it pushes the current group onto the stack and resets `current_group` to an empty string, preparing to capture a new group.
4. When a closing parenthesis (')') is encountered, the function appends it to the `current_group`. If the stack is empty, the current group is yielded and popped from the stack, assuming it forms a complete and balanced group.
5. If the top of the stack matches the current group, it means this closing parenthesis closes the most recent group pushed onto the stack. The stack is popped, and the current group is set back to the previous group (the one before the matched group).
6. If the closing parenthesis doesn't match any group on the stack, it must belong to the next group. In this case, the function pops the current group from the stack and yields it, as it is completed. Then, the closing parenthesis and subsequent characters belong to a new group.
7. The function continues this process until every character in the input string is processed.
8. Finally, if there are any remaining groups on the stack, they are yielded, ensuring that no groups are missing or left unbalanced.

The script's implementation is validated by the provided test case, where the function correctly separates the nested parentheses into individual groups, as demonstrated in the yielded output.
