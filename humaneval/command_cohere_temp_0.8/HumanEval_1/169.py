```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append('')
            elif not stack[-1]:
                result.append('')
            else:
                stack.pop()
                current_group = stack.pop()
                if current_group:
                    result.append(''.join(current_group))
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    # Handle the last group
    if notstack:
        result.append(''.join(stack.pop()))
    
    return result
```

The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of open parentheses `(` and creates a corresponding list `current_group` to store the captured balanced parentheses groups. When it encounters a closing parenthesis `)`, it checks if the last group was empty. If so, it appends an empty string to the result, assuming this was an unbalanced group at the end. Otherwise, it pops the last non-empty group off the stack and appends it to the result. The process continues until all parentheses are processed. The final group is handled appropriately before the function returns. 

This approach guarantees that all balanced groups are captured correctly, even if they are nested or have varying depths, while also ignoring any unnecessary spaces.
