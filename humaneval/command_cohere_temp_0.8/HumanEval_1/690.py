```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []

    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                print('UNBALANCED!'+char)
            else:
                temp = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(temp)
        else:
            current_group.append(char)

    stack.extend(current_group)
    result.extend(stack)
    return result
```

The code uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the stack is checked to see if it is empty, it will output an error if it is empty, indicating an unbalance parenthesis, subsequent to popping the top of the stack, the latter which represents the corresponding open parenthesis. The popped result and current group are combined and stored in the result list. Finally, the while list is popped off the stack into the result list and returned. 

This approach guarantees the correct separation of nested parentheses groups and handles potential imbalances correctly.
