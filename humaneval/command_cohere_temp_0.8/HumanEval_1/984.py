The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. When an open parenthesis `(` is encountered, the current group is pushed to the stack and a new empty group is created. When a closing parenthesis `)` is encountered, the stack is checked for the corresponding open parenthesis. If it exists, the current group is merged with the opened group and the process is repeated until the last group is handled. Throughout the process, any characters that are not opening or closing parentheses are added to the current group. This approach ensures that unbalanced or nested groups are handled correctly. The resulting list of strings contains the separated parenthesis groups.
