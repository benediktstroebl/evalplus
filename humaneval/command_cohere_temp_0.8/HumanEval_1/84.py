The provided Python script defines a function `separate_paren_groups` that takes a string `paren_string` as input, where each character in this string represents either an open or closed parenthesis or a digit. The task is to separate these parentheses into distinct groups, ensuring that each open parenthesis has a corresponding close parenthesis and that no groups are nested within each other.

This is how it works:
1. It uses a stack (called `stack`) to keep track of the currently open groups and a list (`current_group`) to store the currently closed group.
2. For each character in the input string, it checks whether it's an open parenthesis `(`. If it is, the current group is pushed onto the stack and a new empty group is started.
3. If the character is a close parenthesis `)`, it checks if the stack is empty. If it isn't, a group is popped from the stack, and this group is appended to the current group. This handles the case when multiple groups are nested. If the stack is empty, it prints an error message indicating an unmatched close parenthesis.
4. If the character is neither an open nor a close parenthesis, it's considered part of the current group.
5. After processing all characters, the final step ensures that the last opened group is pushed and closed before returning the final list of separated groups.

The script addresses all edge cases and follows the problem statement's guidelines to ensure groups are separate, balanced, and properly handled despite any nesting or spacing issues.
