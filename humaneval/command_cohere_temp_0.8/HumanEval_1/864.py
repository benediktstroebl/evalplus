Here's a Python script that contains a function called `separate_paren_groups` that accepts a string consisting of multiple groups of nested parentheses, separates these groups into individual strings, and returns a list containing these separated groups. The groups are balanced (every open brace has a corresponding close brace) and are not nested within each other. The code is formatted with a markdown code block that includes a dummy test case to demonstrate how the function can be invoked and utilized. 

```python
# Input a string with nested parentheses
paren_string = '( ) (( )) (( ) ( ))'

# Function to separate paren groups
def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    open_braces = '('
    close_braces = ')'
    separated_groups = []
    current_group = ''

    for char in paren_string:
        if char == open_braces:
            current_group += char
        elif char == close_braces:
            if not current_group:
                # Handle extra closing parentheses
                current_group += char
            else:
                separated_groups.append(current_group)
                current_group = ''
        else:
            current_group += char

    # Handle the last group
    if current_group:
        separated_groups.append(current_group)

    return separated_groups

# Test the function
expected_result = ['()', '(())', '(()())']
result = separate_paren_groups(paren_string)
print(f'Expected: {expected_result}\nResult: {result}')
```

This script utilizes a simple approach by maintaining a `current_group` string that accumulates whenever an opening brace is encountered, and resets whenever a closing brace is found. Extra closing braces are handled by incrementing their count in the `current_group` string. The function outputs a list of these separated group strings. The test case at the end demonstrates how the function can be invoked and compared against an expected outcome. 

The dummy test case is used to validate the functionality of the `separate_paren_groups` function and ensure it produces the desired outcome. You can use this code structure as a foundation and integrate it into your test suite or adapt it for other relevant tests.
