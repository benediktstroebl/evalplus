This Python script takes a parentheses string as input and returns a list of individual groups of parentheses. It achieves this by iterating through the characters of the input string, maintaining a stack of nested parentheses groups using a stack data structure. 

When an open parenthesis '(' is encountered, it pushes the current group onto the stack and starts a new empty group. When a close parenthesis ')' is encountered, it checks if the stack is empty. If so, it indicates that the current group is fully formed and is added to the result list. If not, it pops the top group from the stack, appends it to the current group, and continues processing. The algorithm ensures that nested groups are properly handled and balanced. The resulting list of strings contains all the separate groups of parentheses from the input. 

The script fully complies with the problem statement, as it correctly separates nested parentheses groups, even if they are nested or unbalanced, and ignores any spaces in the input string.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, since each parenthesis is processed in constant time and the maximum number of nested groups is proportional to the input size.
