        else:

This code defines a function `separate_paren_groups` which processes a given string of parentheses, splitting
    them into individual groups without any nesting and properly handling nested and unbalanced groups, while
    ignoring spaces. It does so by maintaining a stack of currently open groups and a current group which is
    being built. When it encounters a closing parenthesis, it checks whether the current group is properly
    closed and yields it if so. It also handles the case where an opening parenthesis appears where it is not
    expected, yielding the current group and resetting the state to start a new group from the next opening
    parenthesis. The provided example in the docstring and tests are handled correctly by this code.
