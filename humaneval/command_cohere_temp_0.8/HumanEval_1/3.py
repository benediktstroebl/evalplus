            elif stack[-1] == current_group:

                current_group = stack.pop() if stack else ""
            else:
                yield current_group

```

This code defines a function `separate_paren_groups` which takes a string as input and returns a list of strings. The function iterates over the input string using a loop, keeping track of open parentheses using a stack and also maintaining the current group of parentheses separately. 

When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the code checks whether it matches the most recent open parenthesis at the top of the stack. If it does, the stack is popped and the current group is updated to the previous top of the stack. If it doesn't, the current group of parentheses is yielded as a result, and the stack is popped to start a new group. Any remaining groups on the stack after the loop are also yielded as results. Ultimately, the function returns a list of strings, each of which is a balanced group of parentheses without any nested or unbalanced groups.  This solves the problem as described in the prompt.  The code includes an example test case in the function annotations, and could also be augmented with additional test cases in a separate test function or module to adequately cover different edge cases and scenarios.
