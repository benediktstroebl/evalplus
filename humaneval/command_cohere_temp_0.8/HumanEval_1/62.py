```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                print('Warning: Extra closing parenthesis.')
            else:
                current_group.append(char)
                stack.pop()
                if not stack:
                    result.append(''.join(current_group))
                    current_group = stack[-1]
                else:
                    current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
            
    return result
```
The code uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. It iterates through the input string, pushing a new group onto the stack whenever it encounters an open parenthesis. When it encounters a closing parenthesis, it checks whether the stack is empty or not. If the stack is empty, it means the closing parenthesis is extraneous, and it prints a warning. Otherwise, it pops the top stack item, which is the opening parenthesis of the current group, and adds the closing parenthesis to the current group.

If the stack is not empty after popping the closing parenthesis, it means there is another group nested within the current one, so it pops the next group off the stack and sets it as the current group. The process continues until the end of the string, with the program adding each completed group to the result list. The final result is a list of separated parentheses groups, with nesting and balance corrected as described in the problem statement.
