```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                print(' mismatched bracket')
            else:
                stack.pop()
                result.append(''.join(current_group))
                current_group = stack[-1] if stack else []
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    return result
```

The following logic is used to solve the problem:
1. Create a stack and a list (current_group) to store each group of parentheses separately.
2. Iterate through each character in the input string as char:
   - If the current character is '(', then push the current group onto the stack and empty the current group.
   - If the current character is ')', verify if the stack is empty. If it's not, then this ')' brace closes the
       group at the **top of the stack**, pop it off the stack, and add it to the result list. If the stack is empty,
       this ')' does not have a matching opening brace, and we print a warning signifying a mismatch.
   - For all other characters, regardless of what they are, add them to the current group.
3. Once all characters have been processed, if there is a group left in the stack, it means that the closing ')'
   for this group was missing in the input, and we add an empty string to the result to ensure that the
   groups that did have a closing brace are correctly included in the result list.
4. Return the resulting list. 
5. Example:
   >>> separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')
   ['()', '(())', '(()())']
```
The logic starts by creating two primary variables: stack, which is a list, and current_group, which is initially empty
and is used to store the currently open group of parentheses. The result list is also initialized to empty. The input
string is then iterated through, character by character, with various actions taken based on the current character:
1. If the current character is '(', we assume that it signifies a new group of parentheses, and consequently,
we empty the current group (current_group), and stack the current group (current_group) onto the stack. This
action corresponds to opening a new group of parentheses.
2. If the current character is ')', we first check if the stack is empty. If it isn't, we assume that this ')'
corresponds to the opening bracket ('(') at the top of the stack, and hence we pop that top element off the
stack and onto the result list. However, if the stack *is* empty, this ')' doesn't have a matching opening
bracket in the input, and we print a warning signifying a mismatch in brackets.
3. For all other characters (assuming they are either whitespace or punctuation), we simply add them to the
current group.

After processing all characters in the input string, we are left with an empty current_group and a non-empty
stack. If this latter is the case, it means there was a closing ')' missing in the input, and we append an empty
string to the result to ensure that all groups that did have a closing bracket are included in the final
result. The result list is then returned.
