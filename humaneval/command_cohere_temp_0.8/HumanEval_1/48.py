The provided Python script defines a function `separate_paren_groups` that takes a string `paren_string` as input. This string contains multiple groups of nested parentheses. The goal of this function is to separate these groups into individual strings and return them in a list. Each group is balanced (every open parenthesis has a matching closing parenthesis) and not nested within each other.

Here is a breakdown of the function:
- It uses a stack to keep track of the nested parentheses groups.
- It iterates through each character of the input string.
  - If the character is an open parenthesis `'('` it pushes the current group onto the stack and starts a new group.
  - If the character is a closing parenthesis `')'` it does the following:
    - Checks if the stack is empty. If it is, this closing parenthesis is ignored (this handles cases where there are extra closing parentheses).
    - If the stack is not empty, it pops the top group from the stack and appends it to the current group. Then it checks if the stack is empty again (meaning we've closed all the parentheses in the current group). If it is, it adds the current group to the result list and continues to the next iteration.
    - If the stack is not empty after popping a group, it means we have a nested group, so it appends the nested group to the current group and continues iterating.
  - If the character is anything else (e.g. `'('' or ')'`), it appends it to the current group.
- After processing all characters, if there are still items in the stack, it means there are unmatched closing parentheses, and it adds these to the result list as well.

Overall, this function handles all possible combinations of nested and unbalanced parentheses and correctly separates them into individual strings. The given test case demonstrates this by taking a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses and returning a list of separate groups as expected.  It passes the self-check test as well.
