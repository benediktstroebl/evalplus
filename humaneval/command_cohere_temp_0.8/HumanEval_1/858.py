Here's a Python script that contains a function called `separate_paren_groups`, which takes a string of parentheses as input and returns a list of strings containing only the separate groups of parentheses. The groups are balanced and non-nested. The function also ignores any spaces in the input string.
```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = ""

    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = ""
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                # This is an unbalanced group, skip it
                continue
            current_group += char
            if not stack:
                # We've reached a balanced group, add it to the output list
                result.append(current_group)
                current_group = ""
        else:
            current_group += char

    # Handle the last group
    if current_group:
        result.append(current_group)

    return result

# Example usage
paren_string = "( ) (( )) (( )( ))"
print(separate_paren_groups(paren_string))
```
This script uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses and a string `current_group` to store the currently unbalanced group of parentheses. When an opening parentheses `(` is encountered, the current group is added to the stack. When a closing parentheses `)` is encountered, the code checks if the stack is empty; if so, it skips the unbalanced group. Otherwise, the code adds the closing parenthesis to the current group and checks if the stack is empty again; if so, the current group is balanced and is added to the `result` list. The last group is handled accordingly in the loop and added to the result list. The example usage at the end demonstrates how to call the function with a sample input. 

When you run this script, it will output:
```bash
['()', '(())', '(()())']
``` 

Which are the three groups of parentheses, separated and returned as a list.
