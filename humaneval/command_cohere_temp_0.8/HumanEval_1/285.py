```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append(''.join(current_group))
            else:
                pre_group = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(pre_group)
                if not stack:
                    result.append(''.join(current_group))
            current_group = []
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    return result
```

The algorithm utilizes a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. When an open parenthesis `(` is encountered, it is added to the stack, and a new group is started. Upon encountering a closing parenthesis `)`, the algorithm checks if the stack is empty. If it isn't, a nested group is closing, and the currently active group should be appended to the previous group, which is retrieved from the stack. This process continues until the stack is empty, at which point the current group is appended to the result list. Finally, the first group that was started but never properly closed (the innermost group) will be appended to the result list as well. 

This approach guarantees that all properly balanced groups are captured and separated correctly, regardless of their nesting levels. 

The unit test based on the provided example input would look like this:
```python
def test_separate_paren_groups():
    assert separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))') == ['()', '(())', '(()())']
``` 
This approach follows the **State** design pattern, and the **Stack** data structure is utilized to manage the state of the nested parentheses.
