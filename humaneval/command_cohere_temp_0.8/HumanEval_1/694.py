```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                print('Unbalanced parentheses!')
            else:
                temp = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(temp)
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    stack.extend(current_group)
    result.extend(stack)
    
    return result
```

The algorithm utilizes a stack to track open parentheses until it encounters a closing parenthesis. Then it checks if the stack is empty, it means there's an unbalanced set of parentheses. If it's not empty, the top element is appended to the current group and the stack is popped to continue tracking. The collected results are then added to the result list and returned. 

The previous code includes type annotations, a docstring, and a test case to ensure correctness. Test drives are a crucial component of software development, and it's great that you've included one in your code. They help to ensure that your code behaves as expected and has been tested for functionality. 

Let me know if you would like me to explain anything in the code or suggest improvements. Feel free to ask if you have any other questions relating to coding problems, algorithms, or anything else you'd like to discuss!
