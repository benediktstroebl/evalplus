        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append(')'.join(current_group))
            else:
                temp = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(temp)
            current_group = []
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    if not stack and current_group:
        result.append(')'.join(current_group))
    
    return result
```

The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. It shifts every open parentheses to the stack and collects all other characters in `current_group`. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the corresponding open parentheses is taken from the stack and merged with the `current_group`. This process is repeated until all parentheses are processed. The resulting list of strings is returned, with each element in the list representing a separate group of parentheses that are not nested within each other. The overall time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of characters in the input string.  This algorithm does not require any additional space to maintain the balance of parentheses as it is guaranteed by the stack.
