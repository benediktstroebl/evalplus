        else:
            current_group.append(char)
            
    # Handling edge case where the last group may be incomplete
    if stack:
        pre_group = stack.pop()

The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of open parentheses and constructs the resulting strings accordingly. It initializes an empty list to store the separated strings, and iterates through the input string.

For each character in the input:
- If the character is an open parenthesis `(`, we push the current group onto the stack and start a new empty group.
- If the character is a closing parenthesis `)`:
  - If the stack is empty, we pop the last group and extend it to the current group. Then, we add the combined group to the result list and reset the current group.
  - If the stack is not empty, we pop the top group and extend it to the current group.
- If the character is anything else, we simply append it to the current group.

After processing all characters, we handle the edge case where the last group may be incomplete. If there are any elements left in the stack, we pop the top group, append it to the current group, and add the combined group to the result list.

The resulting list of strings represents the balanced groups of parentheses in the input string. The algorithm is designed to efficiently separate the groups, regardless of their complexity or nesting level.
