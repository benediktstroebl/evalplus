```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                print(f"Unmatched '{char}'")
                return []
            current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    stack.append(current_group)
    result.extend(stack)
    
    return result
```
The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. When an open parentheses `(` is encountered, we push the current group onto the stack and start a new group. When a close parentheses `)` is encountered, we check if the stack is empty. If so, this parentheses is unmatched, and we return an empty list. If not, we pop a group from the stack and append it to the current group. Finally, when the loop is finished, we push the last group onto the stack and extend the result list with the content of the stack. This will give us a list of all the separate parentheses groups, properly balanced and nested within each other.

Here is an example output:
```
Unmatched ')'
```
can be produced if the input string has an unmatched closing parenthesis. The function will print this error message and return an empty list in response to this input. 

This implementation also correctly deals with spaces in the input string. The initial version of the code ignored spaces, which is not necessarily the intended behavior - the algorithm implementation relies solely on the nesting level and balance of the parentheses, not the spaces between them.
