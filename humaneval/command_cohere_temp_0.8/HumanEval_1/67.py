```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return ['Unbalanced input!'] + result
            current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    stack.append(current_group)
    return result + [stack.pop()]
```

This code defines a function `separate_paren_groups` taking in a string of nested parentheses as input, and outputs a list of distinct, nested subsets of parentheses, properly separated and balanced. It works by starting with an empty stack and an initial list to hold the current string fragment. As it iterates through the input string, for opening parentheses it starts a new string fragment by pushing an empty list to the stack. It switches to this new fragment by popping the last pushed list, adds the current character to the current fragment, and handles closing parentheses by switching back to the previous fragment. The final list of fragments is returned, properly balanced even if the input is not. 

This approach prevents nested or unbalanced parentheses from affecting the result, while still being efficient and easy to understand.
