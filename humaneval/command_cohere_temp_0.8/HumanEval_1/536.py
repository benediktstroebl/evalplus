```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                print(f"Invalid input - extra closing brace: {char}")
                return []
            current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    stack.append(current_group)
    # Remove leading/trailing braces if they exist
    while stack and not stack[0]:
        stack.pop(0)
    while stack and not stack[-1]:
        stack.pop()
    result.extend(stack)
    
    return result
```
The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and constructs the result accordingly. It also handles potential unbalanced brackets gracefully, reporting an error message in such cases. The resulting list of strings is then cleaned from leading/trailing brackets and returned.

Here's an example usage:
```python
print(separate_paren_groups("( ) (( )) (( )( ))"))
```
Which would then output:
```bash
['()', '(())', '(()())']
```
