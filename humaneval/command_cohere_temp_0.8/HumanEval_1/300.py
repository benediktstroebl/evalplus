```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return []
            current_group.append(char)
            if not stack[-1]:
                result.append(''.join(current_group))
                stack.pop()
            else:
                current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
            
    return result
```

The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of nesting levels and iterates through the characters of the input string. When an open parenthesis `(` is encountered, it pushes the current group onto the stack and starts a new group. When a closing parenthesis `)` is encountered, it checks if the stack is empty or if the top-most element in the stack is a different group. If so, it pops the stack until a matching group is found and appends the current group to the result. The process continues until all characters have been processed.

This approach ensures that groups of parentheses are correctly separated and returned, even if they are nested or unbalanced.
