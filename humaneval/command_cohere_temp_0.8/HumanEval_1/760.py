```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return []
            current_group.append(char)
            if not stack[-1]:
                result.append(''.join(current_group))
                stack.pop()
            else:
                current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
            
    # handle the last group
    if stack:
        while stack:
            current_group.append(stack.pop())
        result.append(''.join(current_group))
        
    return result
```
The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of opening parentheses until it encounters a closing parenthesis. At that point, it checks if the current group is nested by looking at the top of the stack. If it's not nested, the current group is added to the result list and we move on. If it is nested, we pop the stack and continue to store the current group in the stack. This way, we effectively peel off each layer of nesting while keeping track of the stack.

The last part of the algorithm handles the case when there are more opening parentheses than closing parentheses, by using the stack to unwind the last group correctly. This is a minor variation from the prompt, where spaces were excluded from the input string. Let me know if you'd like to adjust the solution or provide additional clarification!
