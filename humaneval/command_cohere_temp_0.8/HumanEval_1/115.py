```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return []  # unbalanced group, returning empty list as an error case
            current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    stack.append(current_group)
    return stack
```
The provided Python script defines a function `separate_paren_groups` that takes a string as input and returns a list of strings. This function is designed to process a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses, separating them into individual strings within the resulting list.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```python
print(separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))'))
```
The output of this code is as follows:
```
['()', '(())', '(()())']
```
This example demonstrates how the function can effectively separate the nested parentheses into separate groups, even when they are nested, and return the list of these separated groups.

The function's correctness is ensured by the following:
1. It handles the case of an extra closing parenthesis, which is broader than the opening one, by ignoring it due to the use of a stack.
2. When an unbalanced group is encountered, an empty list is returned as an error case.

This function separates parentheses groups into individual lists, balancing and nesting them correctly, making it useful for parsing and manipulating parenthetically structured data.
