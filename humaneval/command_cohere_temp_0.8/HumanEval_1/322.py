    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append(')'.join(current_group))
            else:
                pre_group = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(pre_group)
                if not stack:
                    result.append(')'.join(current_group))
            current_group = []
        else:
            current_group.append(char)

    # handling edge case for unbalanced groups
    if stack:
        while stack:
            pre_group = stack.pop()
            current_group.extend(pre_group)
        result.append(')'.join(current_group))

    return result
```

The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of open parentheses and constructs the resulting strings accordingly. It initializes an empty list `result` to store the separated parentheses groups. For each character in the input string, it checks if it is an open parenthesis `(`. If so, it pushes the current group `current_group` onto the stack and initializes a new empty group. When it encounters a closing parenthesis `)`, it checks if the stack is empty. If it's not, it pops the top group from the stack, appends it to the current group, and checks if the stack is empty again. If it is empty, it appends the current group to the result list and starts a new group. The process continues until all characters have been processed.

It also handles the case where the input string has unbalanced parentheses by keeping any remaining unmatched parentheses in the current group and adding it to the result.

The result list will contain each group of parentheses as a separate string, effectively separating the groups without any nesting or imbalance.
