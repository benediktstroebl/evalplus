The provided Python script defines a function `separate_paren_groups` that takes a string `paren_string` as input. This string contains multiple groups of nested parentheses. The goal of this function is to separate these groups into individual strings and return them in a list. To achieve this, it utilizes a stack data structure to keep track of nested parentheses groups.

Here is a breakdown of the functionality of the code:
1. The initial `current_group` list and `stack` are initialized to `[]`. `current_group` will hold the current group of parentheses that is being examined, while `stack` will store the nested groups.
2. The loop iterates over each character in the input string. If the character is `'(''`, it means a new nested group is starting. Therefore, the current group is appended to the stack, and a new, empty current group is created.
3. If the character is `')'`, it means the current group has reached a closing parenthesis. The code checks if the stack is empty. If it is, there is an unmatched closing parenthesis, and a corresponding error message is printed. 
 4. If there is a group on the stack, the closing parenthesis is appended to the current group, the top element is popped from the stack (effectively closing the previous group), and the process continues. If there are no more groups on the stack, the current group is added to the result list and becomes the new current group. If there are more groups on the stack, the top group is popped and becomes the new current group.
5. The loop continues until all characters in the input string has been processed. Ultimately, the function returns the list of separated parentheses groups.

The provided code includes type annotations, docstrings, and a test case to ensure its correctness. The test case demonstrates the expected output for a specific input string, and the code's functionality aligns with the described approach for solving this problem.
