The provided Python script defines a function `separate_paren_groups` that takes a string `paren_string` as input. This string contains multiple groups of nested parentheses. The goal is to separate these groups into individual strings and return them in a list.

To achieve this, the function uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. It iterates through each character in the input string, tracking open parentheses `'('` and closing parentheses `')'`.

When an open parenthesis is encountered, it pushes the current group (stored in `current_group`) onto the stack. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it's not, an unmatched open parenthesis error is printed, and the top group from the stack is popped and appended to the current group. This ensures that parentheses groups are properly balanced.

After processing all characters, the function performs a final check to ensure there are no unmatched open parentheses. If there are, it prints an error indicating the unmatched open parenthesis.

Finally, the function constructs the result list, which stores each separated group as a string. It appends the concatenated current group (without parentheses) to the result and returns the result.

This code effectively handles nested and balanced parentheses groups, properly handling potential errors related to unmatched parentheses. Thus, it fulfills the problem statement's requirements.
