```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = ""
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            current_group += char
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = ""
        elif char == ')':
            current_group += char
            top_of_stack = stack.pop()
            if top_of_stack == current_group:
                current_group = ""
            else:
                current_group = top_of_stack
    
    return stack
```
The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. For every opening parenthesis encountered,
the current group is appended to the stack, and a new empty group is started. Upon encountering a closing parenthesis,
the top element of the stack is compared with the current group. If they match, the current group is emptied as it is
    } 

finished. If they don't, the top group is popped and restored as the current group to continue building it. This approach
lets the groups be properly separated and nested within each other. 
The following tests are implemented to validate the function:
```python
def test_separate_paren_groups():
    assert separate_paren_groups("( ) (( )) (( )( ))") == ['()', '(())', '(()())']
    assert separate_paren_groups("(a (b))") == ['(a (b))']
    assert separate_paren_groups("(()())") == ['(()())']
    assert separate_paren_groups("()") == [()]
    assert separate_paren_groups("((a))") == [('a')];
``` 
These test cases cover a variety of edge scenarios to ensure the function correctly separates nested parentheses groups,
regardless of their complexity or whether they are nested within each other.
