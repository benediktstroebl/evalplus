The provided Python script defines a function `separate_paren_groups` that takes a string as input and returns a list of strings. This function aims to separate a given string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses into individual lists, ensuring that each group is balanced (properly opened and closed) and not nested within each other.

Here's a step-by-step description of how the function works:
1. The function starts with an empty stack and an initial list called `current_group`, which will be used to store the currently open parentheses.
2. For each character in the input `paren_string`, the function checks if it's an open parenthesis `(`. If so, the current group is pushed onto the stack, and an empty new group is started. This new group will capture the closing parenthesis that will match the current open parenthesis.
3. If the character is a closing parenthesis `)`, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it is, this means an unbalanced parenthesis was encountered, and the function returns an error message. If the stack is not empty, the function pops the top group from the stack, which is the matching open parenthesis group, and appends it to the `current_group`.
4. If the character is neither an open nor a closing parenthesis, it's part of the current group's content, so it is appended to `current_group`.
5. After processing all characters, the function checks if there's an open parenthesis group left in the stack. If so, this means there's an unclosed group, and the function returns an error message. Otherwise, the function adds the current group (`current_group`) to the result list and returns the final result, which is a list of strings where each string represents a balanced group of parentheses.

The script also demonstrates the usage of the function using Python's `unittest` module. The test case provided in the initial problem statement is included and verified against the expected output. Overall, the function is well-structured and efficiently separates the parentheses groups, providing a clear and concise implementation of the specified problem.
