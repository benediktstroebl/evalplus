            if not stack:
                return []  # unbalanced group, returning empty list as convention
            current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    if stack:

The provided Python script implements a function `separate_paren_groups`, which accepts a string input containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. This function's purpose is to segregate these groups into individual strings and return them in a list.

To accomplish this, the function utilizes a stack and a current group, which starts out initially empty. It iterates through each character in the input string.

1. Whenever an open parenthesis '(' is encountered, the current group is appended to the stack, and an empty current group is initialized.
2. When a closing parenthesis ')' is encountered:
   - The function checks if the stack is empty. If it isn't, a valid closure, and the current group can be formed by popping the top item off the stack.
   - If the stack is empty, however, it means there's an unbalanced group (i.e., missing a closing parenthesis), and the function returns an empty list as a convention for such scenarios.
3. For all other characters (any text within the parentheses), they are appended to the current group.

After processing all characters, the function checks if there are any items left on the stack. If not, it means all groups were balanced, and the final current group is appended to the result list.

In summary, this script provides an effective solution for separating nested parentheses into separate groups, gracefully handling any imbalances in the input. The function returns a list of the distinct groups of parentheses found in the order they appear in the input string, or an empty list if there are unbalanced parentheses groups.
