```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []

    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append('')  # Close off incomplete group
            else:
                temp = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(temp)
            if not stack:
                result.append(''.join(current_group))
                current_group = []
        else:
            current_group.append(char)

    # Close off any remaining groups
    while stack:
        temp = stack.pop()
        current_group.extend(temp)
        result.append(''.join(current_group))
        current_group = []

    return result
```

The algorithm utilizes a stack to keep track of opening parentheses until it encounters a closing parenthesis. At this point, it checks if an open parenthesis is at the top of the stack (if there's a corresponding closing parenthesis to close off). If not, it adds an empty string to the result list to close off any open parentheses that were not closed correctly.

The current group of parentheses is only added to the result list if the stack is empty, ensuring that nested groups are not included in the same element of the output. Finally, the code verifies that the number of opening and closing parentheses matches, and the output is a list of separate groups of parentheses.
