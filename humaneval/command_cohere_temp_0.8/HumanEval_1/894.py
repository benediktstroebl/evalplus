```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []

    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return []  # unbalanced group, returning empty list as an error symptom
            current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)

    # handle the last group
    if stack:
        result.extend(stack)
    else:
        result.append(current_group)

    return result
```

This script uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the stack is checked, and if it is empty, this is flagged as an unbalanced group. It then returns an empty list as an error symptom.

If the stack is not empty, the currently opened group is popped from the stack and added to the result list. After processing all characters, the last group (which is still in the `current_group` variable) is checked whether it was the last group, and accordingly, it is added to the result list.

The resulting list of strings represents the separated parenthesis groups, and it is balanced and correctly nested.
