Here's a Python script that contains a function called `separate_paren_groups`, which takes a string of parentheses as input and returns a list of strings containing separate groups of parentheses. The script also includes a test case to demonstrate the function:
```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return []  # Unbalanced group, returning empty list as an indication of failure
            current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    return result + [current_group]

# Test case
assert separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))') == ['()', '(())', '(()())']
```
This script uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. It iterates through the input string, pushing a new group onto the stack whenever it encounters a '(' character and popping the top group from the stack and adding it to the result when it encounters a ')' character. It stores other characters in the current group. After processing the entire string, it combines the last group with the result, as the last group might not have been popped from the stack if the outermost brackets were not properly balanced. The test case ensures that the function produces the expected output for a sample input.
