    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append('')
            elif not stack[-1]:
                result.append('')
            else:
                stack.pop()
                current_group = stack.pop()
                if not stack:
                    result.append('')
                else:
                    result.append(''.join(current_group))
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    # Handle possible remaining open parentheses
    while stack:
        current_group = stack.pop()
        result.append(''.join(current_group))
    
    return result
```

The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of open parentheses `(` and creates a corresponding list `current_group` to store the closed parentheses `)`. It initializes an empty list `result` to store the separated groups.

For each character in the input string, it checks if it is an open or closed parenthesis:
- If it is an open parenthesis `(`, it pushes the current group onto the stack and creates a new empty group.
- If it is a closed parenthesis `)`, it checks if the stack is empty. If true, it appends an empty string to `result` to account for the unbalanced parentheses. If false, it pops a group from the stack and an extra empty group if there is one. It then joins the popped group and the current group (if it exists) to form a complete group and appends it to `result`.
- If it is a character in `current_group`, it appends it to the current group.

After processing all characters, the algorithm will have popped all groups from the stack and appended them to `result`. It will then append any remaining groups left on the stack to `result`. Finally, it returns `result`, which is the list of separated parenthesis groups.
