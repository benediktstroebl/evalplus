                current_group.extend(temp_group)
                if not stack:
                    result.append(')'.join(current_group))
                    current_group = []
        else:
            current_group.append(char)

```

The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. When an open parenthesis `(` is encountered, the current group is pushed to the stack and a new empty group is created. When a closing parenthesis `)` is encountered, the algorithm checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it appends the closing parenthesis to the result as there is an unmatched opening parenthesis. If it's not, the top element from the stack is fetched, which is the previous group, and it's appended to the current group. This process continues until the end of the string is reached, and any remaining groups are appended to the result. The resulting list contains separated parentheses groups, and any unbalanced parentheses are included in the result as individual strings.
