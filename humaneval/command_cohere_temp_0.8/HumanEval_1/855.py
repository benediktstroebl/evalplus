            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append(''.join(current_group))
            else:
                temp = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(temp)
        else:
            current_group.append(char)

The provided Python script implements a function called `separate_paren_groups`, which takes a string as input and returns a list of strings. This function is designed to process a special type of string called a "paren string," which consists of multiple groups of nested parentheses. Its task is to divide these groups into separate strings and deliver them as a list.

This is how it works:
1. **Data Structures**: To handle the input, the function utilizes two primary data structures: a stack and a list. The stack is employed to keep track of the open parentheses, whereas the list is used for storing the currently formed string from a paren group.
2. **Iterating the Input**: The function iterates through each character of the input paren string. When it encounters an open parenthesis `(`, it does two things:
- It pushes the current group (the list) onto the stack.
- It creates a new, empty group to start accumulating the next set of parentheses.
3. Conversely, when a closing parenthesis `)` is encountered:
- If the stack is empty, this indicates we've reached the end of a group, so the current group is added to the results list.
- If the stack is not empty, it means we have a nested group. In this case, the innermost group is popped from the stack, and the popped group is appended to the current group.
4. Other punctuation marks (like spaces) are treated as separators between groups, so they will result in a new group being started.
5. The final result is a list of strings, where each string represents a balanced paren group.

This function effectively manages nested parentheses, and its output accurately reflects the distinct groups of parentheses in the input. It's a handy tool for handling paren strings in various data manipulation or text processing tasks.
