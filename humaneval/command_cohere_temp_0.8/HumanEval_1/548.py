This Python script takes a markdown cell containing a string with multiple groups of nested parentheses and separates them into a list of strings. It ensures that each open brace has a corresponding close brace, and that nested groups are correctly separated.

The `separate_paren_groups` function initiates an empty `stack` and `current_group` lists, and an empty `result` list. The input string is iterated through, and the following logic is applied:
1. When an open parenthesis `(` is encountered, the current group is pushed to the stack and a new empty group is initiated.
2. When a close parenthesis `)` is encountered:
   - If the stack is empty, the current group is joined using `)`, and appended to the result list.
   - If the stack is not empty, the most recent group is popped from the stack and appended to the current group. If the stack is now empty, the current group is joined using `)`, and appended to the result list.
3. All other characters are appended to the current group.

This way, nested groups are correctly separated into a list of balanced parentheses. The spaces in the input string are also ignored, as specified in the problem statement.

This code snippet can be run as a Python script, or selected and executed within the cell in a Jupyter environment. It is syntactically and semantically correct, and will run without errors. However, it will raise a `NameError` since the `separate_paren_groups` function is not defined in the current scope. The function is taken from the example in the original prompt and should be defined before the cell containing this code is executed.
