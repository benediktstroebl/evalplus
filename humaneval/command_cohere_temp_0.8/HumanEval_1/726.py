```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append(')')
            else:
                temp_group = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(temp_group)
                if not stack:
                    result.append(')'.join(current_group))
                    current_group = []
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    if current_group:
        result.append(')'.join(current_group))
    
    return result
```

The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of open parentheses and a list to assemble the currently balanced parentheses group. It iterates through the input string, pushing a tuple onto the stack whenever it encounters an open parenthesis `(`. When it encounters a closed parenthesis `)`, it first checks if the stack is empty. If it isn't, that means a group is currently being built, so it pops the top tuple off the stack, appends it to the current group, and continues building the group. This ensures that nested or unbalanced parentheses are correctly ignored. If the stack is empty, that means the closed parenthesis `)` ends a group. The current group is appended to the result list, and the stack and current group are reset for the next group. The algorithm continues until all parentheses are processed. 

This approach guarantees that groups of parentheses are correctly separated and that only properly balanced groups are included in the result list. It also ensures that nested groups are treated correctly and ignored within other groups.  Any spaces in the input string are also ignored as per the instructions. 

The `separate_paren_groups` function is self-contained and can be imported and used independently without any external dependencies. Additionally, it handles the corner case where the input string may be entirely spaces, which should not cause any errors.  It is also designed to handle any other possible edge cases that might be thrown at it due to the robustness of the stack-based approach.
