    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append(')'.join(current_group))
            else:
                pre_group = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(pre_group)
                if not stack:
                    result.append(')'.join(current_group))
            current_group = []
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    return result
```

The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. When an open parentheses `(` is encountered, the current group is pushed to the stack and a new empty group is created. When a closing parentheses `)` is encountered, the algorithm checks whether the stack is empty. If it is, the current group is complete and is added to the result. If the stack is not empty, the last group popped from the stack is appended to the current group, and the process continues. The result is a list of separate strings, each containing a balanced group of parentheses. 

The method is designed to be efficient and linear, with time complexity O(n), where n is the number of characters in the input string, and is designed to work correctly regardless of the order of parentheses.
