The provided Python script completes the task of separating nested parentheses into separate groups, achieving this through a stack-based approach. It uses a stack to keep track of opening parentheses '(' and constructs the resulting strings by appending each character to the appropriate group. The script returns a list of strings, where each element represents a unique grouping of parentheses. The overall time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, and the space complexity is O(n) as well due to the stack's size.
