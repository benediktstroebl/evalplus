```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append(')'.join(current_group))
            else:
                temp = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(temp)
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    if not stack:
        result.append(')'.join(current_group))
    
    return result
```

The algorithm utilizes a stack to keep track of opening parentheses until it encounters a closing parenthesis. Then, it checks if the stack is empty to decide whether to append the current grouping to the result or to merge the recently closed grouping with the most recent open grouping. This approach allows the necessary nested groupings to be accurately separated from each other.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')
['()', '(())', '(()())']
``` 
This example returns a list that includes each group of parentheses separated independently, as long as they are balanced and not nested within each other.
