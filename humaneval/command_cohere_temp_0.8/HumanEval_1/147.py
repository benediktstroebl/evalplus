```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return ['']
            current_group.append(char)
            stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
            
    # Handle the last group
    if stack:
        return []
    else:
        result.append(''.join(current_group))
        
    return result
```
The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. It initializes an empty list `result` to store the separated groups. It then iterates through the characters of the input string, adding opening parentheses to the stack and starting a new group when it encounters an opening parenthesis. When an closing parenthesis is met, the algorithm checks if the stack is empty; if so, there are unbalanced parentheses, and it returns an empty list as an indication of error. 

Otherwise, it pops a group from the stack, appends the closing parenthesis to the current group, and checks if the current group is empty. If the current group is empty, it indicates that the last closing parenthesis has been encountered, and the algorithm adds the current group (which contains the entire sequence of parentheses between the last opening and closing parenthesis) to the result list. The algorithm continues splitting the string into groups until all parentheses are processed.

The resulting list of strings corrects for any imbalances and does not allow nesting. It effectively separates the input string into a list of self-contained parentheses groups, regardless of their depth or complexity.
