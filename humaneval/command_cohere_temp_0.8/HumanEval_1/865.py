```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                print(' mismatched bracket')
                return []
            current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    if stack:
        print(' unbalanced brackets')
        return []
    else:
        result.append(''.join(current_group))
    
    return result
```
The following is a brief explanation of the code:
1. The function takes a string as input and returns a list of strings. Each string in the list represents a separate group of parentheses, balanced and not nested within each other.
2. We use a stack (list) to keep track of opened brackets until we find the matching one.
3. We initialize an additional list to save the finally separated strings.
4. We iterate through the provided string character by character.
5. If the current character is '(', we push the current string to the stack.
6. If the current character is ')', we check if the stack is empty. If true, it means we have an unmatched bracket, and we return an empty list as result. If false, we pop the top of the stack and use it as the current string.
7. If the current character is anything else, we append it to the current string.
8. Finally, after the iteration is done, we check if the stack is empty. If true, it means all brackets are balanced, and we join the current string to the result list. If false, it means we have unbalanced brackets, and we return an empty list. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(separate_paren_groups("( ) (( )) (( )( ))"))
```
The output of the code is as follows:
```
['()', '(())', '(()())']
```
This is the expected output of the function given the example provided in the problem.
