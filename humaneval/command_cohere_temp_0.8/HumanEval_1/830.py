Here's a Python script that contains a function called `separate_paren_groups`, which takes a string of parentheses as input and returns a list of separate groups of parentheses.
```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []

    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                print("Unmatched ')' found.")
            else:
                current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)

    result.extend(current_group)
    return result

# Example usage
assert separate_paren_groups("( ) (( )) (( )( ))") == ['()', '(())', '(()())']
```
This code uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. When a left parenthesis '(' is encountered, the current group is pushed to the stack and a new group is created. When a right parenthesis ')' is encountered, the corresponding left parenthesis is searched for in the stack, and the current group is replaced with the top element from the stack. If there is no match, it prints an error message for an unmatched right parenthesis. The final result is obtained by extending the list with the contents of the final stack element and any remaining unmatched groups.

The unit test is omitted as you did not ask for it, but ensure that all edge cases like nested groups, unbalanced groups, and spaces are correctly handled by the function. If you would like to include it in the code, let me know and I can add it for you.
