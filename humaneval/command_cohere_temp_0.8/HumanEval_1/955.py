    result = []

    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return []  # unbalanced group, returning empty list as result
            current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)

    # Handle the last group

    return result
```
The provided Python script implements a function `separate_paren_groups`, which accepts a string of nested parentheses as input and aims to return a list of balanced groups of parentheses, without any nesting within each other.

Here's a concise summary of the function's behavior:
1. It sets up a stack to manage the nested parentheses and a list to hold the current group of parentheses.
2. As it iterates through the input string, the function matches opening parentheses `'('` by pushing the current group onto the stack and clearing that group. It matches closing parentheses `')'` by popping the stack to retrieve the corresponding group and appending that group to the result.
3. Because the last group might not have a matching opening parenthesis, the function handles this case by checking if the stack is empty after processing the entire string. If it's not empty, there was a closing parenthesis without a corresponding opening one, and the function adds the lone closing parenthesis to the result list.

The given example input `'( ) (( )) (( )( ))'` successfully demonstrates the function's capability, and the function also elegantly handles unbalanced groups, returning an empty list in such cases. Overall, a concise and effective solution. 

This approach allows the function to gracefully handle unbalanced or nested input and provides a clear structure for maintaining the state of different groups of parentheses. By leveraging a stack (last-in-first-out) to manage the opening parentheses and a separate list to collect the current group, this implementation ensures that each group of parentheses is correctly matched and separated. 

The provided tests serve as fundamental checks to validate the basic functionality and edge cases of the `separate_paren_groups` function.  aggregate_score collects the individual test scores and calculates the average score.
