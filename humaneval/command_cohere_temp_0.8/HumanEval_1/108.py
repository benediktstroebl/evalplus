```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append('')
            elif not stack[-1]:
                result.append('')
            else:
                stack.pop()
                result.append(''.join(current_group))
                current_group = stack[-1]
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    if current_group:
        result.append(''.join(current_group))
    
    return result
```

The algorithm utilizes a stack to keep track of opening parentheses until it encounters a closing parenthesis. Then, it checks if the last element of the stack is empty; if so, it means the currently processed parentheses group is nested within another group, and this nested group is ignored. If the last element of the stack is not empty, it means it corresponds to the closing parentheses of the current group, and this group is added to the result list. Subsequently, the stack is popped to ensure the stack only contains the nested groups that should be added to the result. Finally, all strings in the stack are appended to the result list, giving you a list of separate parentheses groups.  This approach ensures that groups are balanced and not nested within each other, solving the given problem.
