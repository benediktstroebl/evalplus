```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                print('UNBALANCED!)'
            else:
                temp = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(temp)
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    stack.extend(current_group)
    result.extend(stack)
    
    return result
```

The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of open parentheses `(` and constructs the result string from it. When a closing parenthesis `)` is encountered, the stack is checked, and if it's empty, it means the parentheses are unbalanced. In that case, an error is printed. Otherwise, the top element of the stack (which represents a string of parentheses that closes the opening parenthesis) is popped out and appended to the current group. The resulting strings, including any nested groups, are then added to `result`, and the final result list is returned.
