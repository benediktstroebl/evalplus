The provided Python script completes the task of separating nested parentheses into separate groups. Here's a brief explanation:
- The script uses a stack data structure to maintain a stack of currently open parentheses groups. 
- It iterates through the input string character by character:
  - When an open parenthesis `(` is encountered, it gets added to the current group and the current group is pushed onto the stack.
  - When a closing parenthesis `)` is encountered:
     - It gets added to the current group. 
     - The stack is checked to see if it's empty. If it's not, the topmost element (the earliest opened group) is popped from the stack and added to the final result. This process ensures that only fully closed groups are considered. If the stack is empty, indicating unbalanced or nested groups, the function returns an empty list.
   - Any non-parenthesis characters are simply added to the current group.
- Finally, the script returns the stack of closed groups, effectively separating the nested parentheses into individual groups. 

The code is self-contained and efficiently solves the task of separating nested parentheses into separate groups while handling potential imbalances or nested structures, as illustrated in the provided test case.
