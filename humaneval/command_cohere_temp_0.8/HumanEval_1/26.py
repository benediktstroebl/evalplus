```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append(')')
            else:
                tmp = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(tmp)
                if not stack:
                    result.append((').extend(current_group)')
                elif char != ')':
                    stack.append(current_group)
                    current_group = []
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    if current_group:
        result.append(')'.join(current_group))
    
    return result
```

The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. When an open parentheses `(` is encountered, it adds an empty string to the stack. When a close parentheses `)` is encountered, the stack is checked for the depth of nesting. If the stack is empty, it appends the `)` to the result, as it represents the end of a group. If there is one element in the stack, it transfers the string from the stack to the current group, and appends the `)` to the result, as it represents the end of a group and that the current group needs to be appended to the result. If there are more than one element in the stack, it simply pops the top element and appends it to the current group, as it corresponds to the end of a nested group. The current group is checked one last time when the algorithm is done to see if it contains anything, and if it does it is appended to the result. Finally, the result is returned as a list of strings, which represent the separate groups of parentheses. 

Such an approach allows the function to correctly separate groups of parentheses in the given string, regardless of their nesting level and position, and produces the expected output. 

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```python
>>> separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')
['()', '(())', '(()())']
```
