```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                print(f"Unmatched close brace: {char}")
                return []
            current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    stack.append(current_group)
    return stack
```
The code uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and creates a corresponding list for each open bracket until it finds a closing bracket. It also handles the case when the closing bracket is not matched properly. Let's assume the given test case `('( ) (( )) (( )( ))'`) for further explanation:
- The loop goes through each character in this string.
- When it encounters the open bracket `'('` it does the following:
  - pushes `current_group` (empty at the beginning) to the `stack`.
  - Initializes a new `current_group` to collect the content of the next parentheses group.
- When it encounters the close bracket `')'`, it performs the following:
  - pops the top of the stack to obtain the corresponding opening bracket 
  - if the stack is empty, an unmatched close brace is detected and the function returns an empty list.
  - append the collected content (i.e. `current_group`) to the `result`.
- For any other characters (including spaces), it simply appends them to the `current_group`.

After the loop, the code handles the last closing bracket by popping the top of the stack and adding it to the `result`. Finally, it returns the `result`, which in the aforementioned test case would be `['()', '(())', '(()())']`.  This approach allows us to properly handle any nested or unbalanced parentheses and provides a clear way to handle multiple groups.
