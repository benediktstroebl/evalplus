Here's a Python script that contains a function called `separate_paren_groups` that takes a string consisting of multiple groups of nested parentheses, separates them into individual strings, and returns a list containing these separated groups. The groups are balanced (every open brace has a matching close brace) and are not nested within each other. The script also includes a test case that demonstrates the function's behavior:
```python
# Importing Type Annotations module from Python
from typing import List


def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
    separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
    Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
    Ignore any spaces in the input string.
    
    Parameters:
    - paren_string (str): Input string containing nested parentheses groups

    Returns:
    - list[str]: List of strings, where each string is a separate group of parentheses
    """
    # List to store the final separated groups
    results: List[str] = []
    # Current group that is being built up as we traverse the input string
    current_group: str = ''
    # Iterate through each character in the input string
    for char in paren_string:
        # If the current character is an open parentheses '('
        if char == '(':
            # If the current group is not empty, add it to the results and start a new group
            if current_group:
                results.append(current_group)
                current_group = ''
        # If the current character is a close parentheses ')'
        elif char == ')':
            # If the current group is empty, it means we have an extra closing parenthesis, ignore it
            if not current_group:
                continue
            # If the current group is not empty, it means we have a match, add it to the results
            results.append(current_group)
            current_group = ''
        # If the current character is neither an open nor a close parentheses, it's probably a space, ignore it
        # and continue building the current group
        else:
            current_group += char
    # If the current group was not empty, add it to the results
    if current_group:
        results.append(current_group)
    # Return the final list of separated groups
    return results


# Example usage
assert separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))') == ['()', '(())', '(()())']
```
In this code, the `separate_paren_groups` function iterates through each character in the input string. When it encounters an open parenthesis `(`, it checks if the current group is empty. If not, it adds the current group to the results list and starts a new group. When it encounters a close parenthesis `)`, it checks if the current group is empty. If it's empty, it ignores the closing parenthesis as it belongs to an outer group. If the current group is not empty, it adds it to the results list as a separate group. The function ignores spaces and any other non-parentheses characters. Finally, it returns the list of separated groups. 

The test case demonstrates the function's behavior by providing an example input and checking if the output matches the expected result.
