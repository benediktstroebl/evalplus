```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = ""

    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = ""
        elif char == ')':
            current_group += char
            if not stack:
                return []
            top_group = stack.pop()
            if not stack:
                result.append(top_group)
            else:
                stack[-1] += top_group
        else:
            current_group += char

    return result
```

The code uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, it is added to the current group and the stack is checked for an open group to close. If there are no more open parentheses, the current group is added to the results list and popped from the stack. If there are more open parentheses, the top group on the stack is added to the current group, as it is nested within it. The process continues until all parentheses are balanced and separated. 

Note that the function returns a `List[str]` that could contain valid Markdown code blocks (i.e. multi-line strings) since the returned list could contain newline characters. If this is not the intended behavior, the result could be converted to a `List[str]` with only a single line by using `[''.join(result)]`.
