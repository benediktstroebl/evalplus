This Python script takes a string of characters containing nested parentheses, and returns a list of substrings between balanced parentheses pairs, ignoring any spaces, and without allowing nested groups to be considered as a single group. 
It does so by starting with an empty stack and appending to it each time a closing parenthesis ')' is encountered, removing the corresponding group from the stack when an opening parenthesis '(' is encountered, and handling nested groups correctly. 
If a nested group is encountered, it will correctly be treated as a separate group, and not be merged with the parent group. 

#### Complexity Analysis:
* Time Complexity: 
    - This algorithm’s time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of characters in the input string of parentheses. 
    - It analyzes each character exactly once and does not have any recursive calls, so there’s no risk of performance on large inputs.
* Space complexity: 
    - The space complexity is O(k), where k is the maximum depth of nesting of parentheses in the input string. 
    - The stack space is proportional to the maximum depth of the recursion stack, which is a worst-case assumption of the depth of nesting in the input. 

#### Tips:
* Use a stack (Last-In-First-Out) data structure to simulate the behavior of unbalanced nesting, as the problem asks to handle nested groups correctly.
* The problem requires handling nested groups, a recursive approach could be more appropriate and simpler to implement. 

This approach can be improved in efficiency if the input contains a extremely deep nesting of parentheses. 

To achieve that, we can keep track of the depth of the currently open brackets, and allocate the necessary memory for the stack only once, avoiding the need to pop the last added element each time. 

However, this would require a different implementation and further modifications to the stack handling.
