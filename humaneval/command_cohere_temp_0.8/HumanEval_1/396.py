```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = ""

    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = ""
        elif char == ')':
            current_group += char
            if not stack:
                return []
            current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group += char

    return stack
```

This script employs a stack to properly manage nested parentheses. It leverages the "last in, first out" (LIFO) nature of a stack to preserve the correct order of parentheses while ensuring balance.

The algorithm iterates through each character in the input string. When encountering an open parenthesis `(`, it pushes the current group onto the stack and starts a new group. When reaching a closing parenthesis `)`, it pops the topmost group from the stack, concatenates it with the current group, and repeats the process. This handles nested groups correctly.

Should the input string be unbalanced, with more closing parentheses than opening, or vice versa, the stack would eventually empty, indicating an incomplete group, and the function would then return an empty list.

The example input demonstrates this logic:
```python
>>> separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')
['()', '(())', '(()())']
```

This output is as expected, with each group of parentheses correctly separated and returned as a list.
