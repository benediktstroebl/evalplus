Here's a Python script that contains a function called `separate_paren_groups` that solves the problem as described in the code block provided:
```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    open_braces = [0]
    close_braces = [0]
    output = []
    stack = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            open_braces[0] += 1
        elif char == ')':
            close_braces[0] += 1
        else:
            for _ in range(open_braces[0]):
                stack.append('')
            
            if open_braces[0] != close_braces[0]:
                # Unbalanced, ignore and move on
                open_braces[0] = 0
                close_braces[0] = 0
                continue
            
            current_group = ''.join(stack)
            output.append(current_group)
            
            open_braces[0] = 0
            close_braces[0] = 0
            stack = []
    
    # Process remaining open braces
    for _ in range(open_braces[0]):
        stack.append('')
    
    current_group = ''.join(stack)
    output.append(current_group)
    
    return output
```
This script assumes a string `paren_string` as input, and returns a list of strings, where each string corresponds to a balanced group of parentheses found in the input string. 
Here's an example usage of the function:
```python
print(separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))'))
```
This will output:
```bash
['()', '(())', '(()())']
```
The function uses two counters, one for keeping track of open braces `'('` and one for keeping track of closed braces `')'`. It initializes these counters and a stack (to keep track of the current group) before iterating through each character of the input string. It increments the appropriate counter based on the character and checks if the current group is balanced. If it is, it adds the current group to the output list and resets the counters and stack. The output list is then returned after processing all characters.
