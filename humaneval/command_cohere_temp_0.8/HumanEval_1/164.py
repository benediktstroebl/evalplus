This code provides a function called `separate_paren_groups`, taking a string as its input parameter, and returns a list of strings. The inner workings involve maintaining a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups, a `current_group` variable is used to combine the characters of a particular group. Using the loop through each character of the input string, it checks if the character is an opening parenthesis `(`, it adds it to the current group and also adds the current group to the stack. On encountering a closing parenthesis `)`, it checks if the current group is empty, implying the closing parenthesis belongs to the outermost group; otherwise, it pops the top group from the stack, which is the opening parenthesis counterpart of the current group, and appends it to the current group. Ultimately, the stack contains all the unique nested group strings, which are returned as a list. This algorithm is space efficient as it only uses a single stack, and linear in terms of time complexity since it iterates the input string once. 
The given test case provides a string input of `'( ) (( )) (( )( ))'`, and expects a list output of `['()', '(())', '(()())']`; accordingly, the function is correctly implemented to return the expected output. Gpython

This is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem using a single function, `separate_paren_groups`, which takes a string of parentheses and returns a list of strings of the separated parentheses groups.
