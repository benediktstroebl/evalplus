The provided Python script implements a function named `separate_paren_groups`, which accepts a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. This function is designed to separate these groups into individual strings and return them in a list. It accomplishes this by utilizing a stack data structure to keep track of nested parentheses groups. 

To handle the string with parentheses, the algorithm does the following:
1. Iterate Through the Characters of the Input String: For each character in the input `paren_string`, the algorithm analyzes whether it is an open parenthesis `(` or a close parenthesis `)`.
2. Stack for Nested Groups: When an open parenthesis is encountered, the algorithm pushes the current group onto the stack, indicating a new group is starting. When a close parenthesis is encountered, the algorithm pops the top of the stack to retrieve the corresponding open parenthesis and close the current group. If there are no open parentheses on the stack, it indicates an unmatched close parenthesis.
3. Collecting Results: The current group accumulates characters between open and close parenthesis pairs. This group is appended to the result list when it is closed.
4. Handling Special Cases: If the input string is well-formed, the algorithm will remove all spaced and return a list of separate groups. However, if there is an unmatched close parenthesis, it will issue a message indicating the imbalance and return an empty list.

The script returns a list of strings, each of which contains a balanced group of parentheses with no spaces. To illustrate, if the input is `"( ) (( )) (( ()( )))"`, the script's output would be `['()', '(())', '(()())']`.
