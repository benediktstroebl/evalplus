```python

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append(''.join(current_group))
            else:
                pre_group = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(pre_group)
                if not stack:
                    result.append(''.join(current_group))
            current_group = []
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    return result
```

The algorithm utilizes a stack to keep track of opening parentheses `(` and constructs the corresponding closing parentheses `)`. It shifts the current group onto the stack when an opening parentheses is encountered. When a closing parentheses is encountered, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it isn't, the topmost element is appended to the current group and the process is repeated until the stack is empty. At this point, the current group is appended to the results list which is then returned. 

This approach ensures that unbalanced or nested groups of parentheses are correctly handled. The theoretical runtime of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of characters in the input string, as it checks each character exactly once. 

The approach is analogous to the implementation of a stack data structure in reverse polish notation (RPN) calculators. Such calculators execute calculations by pushing operands and operators onto a stack and then repeatedly popping the two topmost elements from the stack and using them to form the result of the calculation. Thus, the current_group here plays the role of the calculator's output display, the stack plays the role of the calculation stack, and the algorithm iterating over the input string and manipulating the stack plays the role of the calculator executing operations and displaying results. 

This approach can be improved upon by using a more efficient stack implementation, such as a linked list, to reduce the maximum space used by the stack to O(n), where n is the depth of the deepest stack.
