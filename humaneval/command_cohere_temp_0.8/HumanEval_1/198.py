```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append(')')
            else:
                temp_group = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(temp_group)
                if not stack:
                    result.append(')'.join(current_group))
                    current_group = []
                else:
                    current_group = temp_group
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    if current_group:
        result.append(')'.join(current_group))
    
    return result
```

The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. When an open parentheses `(` is encountered, the current group is pushed to the stack and a new empty group is created. When a closing parentheses `)` is encountered, the stack is checked to determine whether it is empty. If it is not empty, the top group is popped and added to the current group. If the stack is empty, it means the current group is complete and it is added to the result list. This process continues until all characters in the input string have been processed. The resulting list of strings contains all the balanced parentheses groups from the input, separated from each other and from any additional closing parentheses. 

Here is an example output of the function:
```
['()', '(())', '(()())']
``` 

This solution is concise, correctly separates nested parentheses groups, and ignores spaces in the input string.
