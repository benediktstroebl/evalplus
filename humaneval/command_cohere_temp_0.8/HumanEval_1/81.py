```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append(')')
            else:
                temp_group = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(temp_group)
                if not stack:
                    result.append(')'.join(current_group))
                    current_group = []
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    #Deal with the remaining stack and current group
    while stack:
        temp_group = stack.pop()
        current_group.extend(temp_group)
    if current_group:
        result.append(')'.join(current_group))
    
    return result
```

The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of open parentheses until it encounters a closing parenthesis. Then it checks if the current group is empty, in which case it appends the closing parenthesis to the result as an unmatched closing parenthesis, or if the current group contains the entire content of a parenthesis group, which is the case when the stack is empty. In this case, it appends the joined string of the current group to the result.

The script also handles the case when the closing parentheses are nested within each other as depicted in the example provided in the problem statement. In this case, the nested parentheses are correctly processed as described above.
