Here's a Python script that contains a function called `separate_paren_groups`, which takes a string of parentheses as input and returns a list of strings that represent the separate groups of parentheses. The code is formatted with a markdown code block, as requested:
```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    separate_groups = []
    stack = []
    for c in paren_string:
        if c == '(':
            stack.append('')
        elif c == ')':
            if not stack:
                print(f"Unmatched right parenthesis '{c}' found!")
                continue
            group = ''.join(stack).strip("()")
            separate_groups.append(group)
            stack.pop()
    while stack:
        group = ''.join(stack).strip("()")
        separate_groups.append(group)
        stack.pop()
    return separate_groups

# Example usage
assert separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))') == ['()', '(())', '(()())']
```
This script uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. It iterates through the characters of the input string, pushing empty strings onto the stack whenever it encounters an open parentheses '('. When it encounters a close parentheses ')', it checks if the stack is empty (which would indicate an unbalanced parenthesis) or if the last item pushed onto the stack was an open parentheses '('. If either of these conditions is true, it removes the corresponding group from the stack, joins it into a single string, and adds it to the list of separate groups. Finally, any remaining items on the stack after the main loop are also processed and added to the list of separate groups to ensure that all groups are captured.

The example usage demonstrates the function with a test case and asserts that the expected output is returned.
