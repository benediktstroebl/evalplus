This script uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. When it encounters a closing parenthesis, it checks if the stack is empty. If not, a group was opened previously, so it adds the previously opened group to the current group and pops the group off the stack. If the stack is empty, the current group is considered a separate group and is added to the result list. The function also accounts for the edge case where the last group may not be properly closed. 

The script passes the test cases provided in the original prompt. Would you like to provide additional test cases to further validate its functionality? Feel free to experiment with different inputs and edge cases to ensure the function is robust against potential issues. Let me know how I can help!
