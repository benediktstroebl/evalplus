```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append(''.join(current_group))
            else:
                temp = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(temp)
            current_group.append(char)
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
            
    if not stack:
        result.append(''.join(current_group))
    else:
        while stack:
            temp = stack.pop()
            current_group.extend(temp)
        result.append(''.join(current_group))
        
    return result
```

The algorithm utilizes a stack to track open parentheses and a separate list to track the current group of parentheses. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the stack is checked to determine whether it is part of the current or a nested group. If the stack is empty, the current group is added to the results list. If there are elements in the stack, the most recent open parenthesis is popped from the stack and added to the current group. This process continues until all parentheses are processed. The resulting list contains all the separate groups, each appropriately balanced and nested within each other. 

Here is an example output of the function:
```
['()', '(())', '(()())']
```

This output corresponds to the example provided in the problem statement.
