    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append(')')
            else:
                temp = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(temp)
                if not stack:
                    result.append((').extend(current_group)')
                elif char != ')':
                    current_group.append(')')
                    stack.append(current_group)
                    current_group = []
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    if current_group:
        stack.append(current_group)
    return result
```

The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. When an open parenthesis `(` is encountered, it pushes the current group onto the stack and starts a new group. When a close parenthesis `)` is encountered, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it appends the closing parenthesis to the result as there are no open parentheses to close. If it is not, it pops the top item from the stack, which is the most recently opened group, and appends its contents to the current group. It then checks if the stack is empty again. If it is not, that means there is another group to close, so it appends the closing parenthesis to the current group and pushes it onto the stack. If it is, then the current group is the last group to close and it appends its contents to the result. This process effectively peels off each layer of nested parentheses and combines them into separate strings, which are returned as a list. 

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of characters in the input string, since it processes each character once and does not perform any recursive operations. It also uses O(l) additional space, where l is the depth of the deepest bracket, for the stack to keep track of open brackets.
