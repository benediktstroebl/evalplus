```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []

    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append(')')
            else:
                temp = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(temp)
                if not stack:
                    result.append(')'.join(current_group))
                    current_group = []
        else:
            current_group.append(char)

    # Add the last group
    if not stack and current_group:
        result.append(')'.join(current_group))

    return result
```

The code uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. When a '(' is encountered, it pushes the current group onto the stack and starts a new group. When a ')' is encountered, it checks if the stack is empty - if so, it appends ')' to the result as an indication that a group starts there. If not, it pops a group from the stack, appends its elements to the current group, and checks if the stack is empty again - if so, it adds the current group to the result. Finally, any ')' characters encountered without corresponding openings are handled correctly. 

Note that this approach avoids using recursion, which can lead to performance issues with long input strings due to the potential for excessive function call overhead.
