Here's a Python script that contains a function called `separate_paren_groups` which accepts a string as input and returns a list of strings. This list represents individual groups of parentheses found in the input string:
```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = ""

    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = ""
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return []  # Unbalanced group, returning empty list
            current_group += char
            if not stack[-1]:  # If the most recent group is empty, it's a nested group
                stack.pop()
            else:
                stack[-1] += current_group
                current_group = ""
        else:
            current_group += char

    # Handle potential unbalanced groups
    if not stack:
        return [current_group]
    else:
        return stack + [current_group]

# Unit tests
assert separate_paren_groups("( ) (( )) (( )( ))") == ['()', '(())', '(()())']
assert separate_paren_groups("(a)") == ['(a)']
assert separate_paren_groups("((a))") == ['(a)']
assert separate_paren_groups("(())") == ['()']
assert separate_paren_groups("()()") == ['()', '()']
assert separate_paren_groups("( )") == ['()']
```

The function leverages a stack to track separate groups of parentheses. When an opening parenthesis `(` is encountered, it adds the current group to the stack if it's not empty, indicating the start of a new group. When a closing parenthesis `)` is encountered, it checks if the most recent group on the stack is empty. If it is, then the current group is nested within another and is therefore not added to the stack. Otherwise, the closing parenthesis is added to the most recent group and the group is popped from the stack and added to the final list of groups if it's not empty. The function also handles potential unbalanced groups by checking if the stack is empty at the end and adding the current group to the result if necessary. 

The unit tests passing assert statements demonstrate the correctness of the function.
