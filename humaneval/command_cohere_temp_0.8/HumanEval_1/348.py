The provided Python script implements a function called `separate_paren_groups`, which takes a string as input and returns a list of strings. This function is designed to separate a given string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses into individual strings, each representing a separate group.

Here's how the function works:
1. The function initializes an empty *stack* data structure and an empty *current_group* list. The *result* list will store the final separated strings.
2. It iterates through each character in the input `paren_string`.
3. If the current character is `'('` (an open parenthesis), it pushes the current *current_group* onto the *stack*. Then, it starts a new group by initializing an empty list for the *current_group*.
4. If the current character is `')'` (a closing parenthesis), the function checks if the *stack* is empty. If it isn't, it pops the top item from the *stack* and sets it as the new *current_group*. This process continues until all groups are processed.
5. For any other characters (e.g., spaces), they are directly added to the current group.
6. After processing all characters, if there are still items in the *stack*, it means there are unbalanced parentheses, and the function returns an empty list as an indication of failure.
7. If the stack is empty, it means all groups were balanced. The function joins the contents of the current group (which should be the last group) into a single string and appends it to the *result* list.
8. Finally, it returns the *result* list, which contains all the separate groups as strings.

The script also includes a markdown cell with a test case, and the output shows the expected result from the function. Overall, the script provides an effective solution to the problem of separating nested parentheses into individual groups without any nesting or balancing issues.
