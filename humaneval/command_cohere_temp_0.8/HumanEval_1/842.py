This Python script uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. It iterates through the characters of the input string, pushing a new group onto the stack whenever it encounters an open parentheses '('. It also starts an empty group whenever it encounters a closing parentheses ')' and there is a group on the stack to close. All other characters are appended to the current group.

The resulting list of strings, representing the separated parentheses groups, is returned by the function. This approach ensures that nested or unbalanced parentheses groups cause errors or undefined behaviors. 
The provided test case demonstrates the function and showcases its ability to successfully separate the parentheses groups. 
If you have any doubts about the implementation or the idea behind it, feel free to ask. I am here to provide clarity and ensure you understand the logic behind this process.  Also, if you have any other prompts or ideas, I'm happy to assist in any way I can!
