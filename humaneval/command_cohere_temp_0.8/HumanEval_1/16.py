```

This script uses a stack to keep track of nested parens groups. It iterates through the input string, adding characters to the current group when parens are encountered. When an open paren '(' is encountered, we push the current group onto the stack and start a new group. When a close paren ')' is encountered:
1. If the stack is empty, the current group is balanced, so we yield it.
2. If the top of the stack matches the current group, we close out the current group, and pop the stack.
3. If the top of the stack doesn't match the current group, we pop the stack to get the last closed group, add that to the output, and then continue with the current group.

This results in a list of groups, with no nesting and properly balanced braces. The order of groups is determined by their depth in the original string, with the deepest braces being the first to be closed. Any spaces are also ignored in the output. 

The `>>> separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')` comment at the top of the original prompt indicates that this function should yield the list ['()', '(())', '(()())'], based on the input string '( ) (( )) (( )( ))'.
