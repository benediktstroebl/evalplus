The provided Python script implements a function called `separate_paren_groups`, which takes a string as input and returns a list of strings. This function is designed to process a special input string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Its purpose is to separate these groups into individual strings and return them in a list format. The function addresses the cases of balanced parentheses and ensures that groups are not nested within each other. It also handles scenarios where there are extra closing parentheses and ignores any spaces in the input string. The overall process involves a stack data structure to manage the nesting of parentheses.

The function's test cases pass, indicating its correctness. However, it's important to note that this solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops needed to traverse and dissect the input string. The space complexity is O(n) due to the stack size being proportional to the number of open brackets encountered. While this approach is straightforward, considering alternative methods like recursive descent or parsing techniques could improve efficiency for larger inputs.
