```python

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append(')')
            else:
                temp_group = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(temp_group)
                if not stack:
                    result.append(')'.join(current_group))
                    current_group = []
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    # Handling edge case where the last group may not be properly closed
    if current_group:
        result.append(')'.join(current_group))
    
    return result
```

The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of open parentheses and a separate list to collect the current group of parentheses. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the stack is checked to see if it's empty. If not, a nested grouping is occurring, so the top element of the stack is appended to the current group, and the stack is popped to continue processing the deeper grouping. If the stack *is* empty, the current group is considered complete, and it's added to the results list. This approach ensures that all groups are properly separated and nested within each other. 

The script would be a part of a larger module, so it assumes there are additional import statements and a corresponding suite of test cases for proper functionality. 

To tackle potential problems like unbalanced or nested groups, the algorithm leverages a stack to keep track of open parentheses and selectively adds onto the current group string when closing parentheses are encountered. This ensures that groups are properly separated and nested groupings are correctly processed.
