```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append(')')
            else:
                temp_group = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(temp_group)
                if not stack:
                    result.append(')'.join(current_group))
                    current_group = []
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    # Handle the last group
    if not stack and current_group:
        result.append(')'.join(current_group))
    
    return result
```

The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. When an open parenthesis is encountered, it pushes the current group onto the stack and starts a new group. When a close parenthesis is encountered, it checks if the stack is empty. If so, it appends the ')' character to the result as there is an unmatched opening parenthesis. If not, it pops a group from the stack and appends it to the current group. This continues until the end of the string is reached. The final group is then appended to the result list after verifying if it was the last group. 

The resulting list of strings represents the separate groups of parentheses.
