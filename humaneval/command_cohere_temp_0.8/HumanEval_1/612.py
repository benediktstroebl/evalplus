```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return ['Invalid input! No opening paren to match this closing one.']
            current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    stack.append(current_group)
    return stack
```
The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets ('(') and builds a corresponding list of strings. It also uses a list to store the current group of parentheses that are nested within each other and separates them based on the logic you described in the prompt. This approach ensures that each open brace has a corresponding closing one and that groups are not nested within each other. Let's pass the test!
