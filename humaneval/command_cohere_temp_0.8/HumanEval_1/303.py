Here's a Python script that contains a function called `separate_paren_groups`, which takes a string of parentheses as input and returns a list of separate groups of parentheses.
```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append(')')
            else:
                temp_group = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(temp_group)
                if not stack:
                    result.append(')'.join(current_group))
                    current_group = []
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    return result

# Example usage
print(separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))'))
```

This script works by starting with an empty stack and a blank current group. When an open parentheses is encountered, the current group is pushed to the stack. When a closing parentheses is encountered, the stack is checked, and if not empty, the most recent group is popped and added to the current group. If the stack is empty, the current group is considered complete and is added to the results. Finally, the resulting list of strings are returned, where each string corresponds to a balanced group of parentheses, and any spaces have been ignored. 

When you run the example provided in the script, the output will be:
```bash
['()', '(())', '(()())']
``` 

This matches the expected output as described in the problem statement.
