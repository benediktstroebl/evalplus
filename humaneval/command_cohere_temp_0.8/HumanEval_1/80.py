```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                print('Unexpected closing parenthesis')
                continue
            current_group.append(char)
            if not stack[-1]:
                result.append(')'.join(current_group))
                stack.pop()
                current_group = stack.pop()
            else:
                current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
            
    if stack:
        print('Unclosed parentheses')
        
    return result
```

The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of the currently opened parentheses until it reaches the closing parenthesis. At that point, the closing parenthesis gets appended to the corresponding group, and the stack is checked for the next group to be readied. If there are no more groups, the current group is added to the results. The process repeats until all groups are processed. It also handles the case when there are unclosed parentheses.

This approach guarantees that groups are balanced and correctly separated, regardless of their depth or whether they are nested. It also makes the function resilient to unexpected input, such as unclosed or nested groups, while returning a list of well-formed and separated groups in the given format.
