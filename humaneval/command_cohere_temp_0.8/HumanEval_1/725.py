```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append(''.join(current_group))
            else:
                temp = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(temp)
            current_group.append(char)
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
            
    if not stack:
        result.append(''.join(current_group))
    else:
        temp = stack.pop()
        current_group.extend(temp)
    return result
```

The algorithm utilizes a stack to keep track of opening parentheses `(` and constructs the corresponding closing parentheses `)`. It also uses a separate list to store the current string of parentheses that are being analyzed. The while loop goes through each character in the input string and decides what to do based on the character:
1. If the character is an opening parenthesis `(`- the current string is pushed to the stack and a new empty string is created to hold the new group of parentheses. 
2. If the character is a closing parenthesis `)`- the algorithm checks if the stack is empty. If true, it means we have reached the end of a group, and the current string should be added to the results. If false, the algorithm pops a string from the stack, appends it to the current string, and then adds the closing parenthesis to the current string. 
3. If the character is anything else- the algorithm simply appends it to the current string.

Once the loop has gone through all characters, the algorithm checks if the stack is not empty. If false, it means there are still some unopened parentheses, and the last popped string from the stack is added to the current string. The results list is returned.

The above approach has an advantage that the stack space usage is quite predictable and will not grow too large for large input strings.
