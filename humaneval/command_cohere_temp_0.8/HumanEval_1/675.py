```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                print(f"Unmatched close parenthesis '{char}'")
                return []
            current_group = stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group.append(char)
    
    stack.append(current_group)
    result.extend(stack)
    
    return result
```
The provided Python script defines a function `separate_paren_groups` that takes a string `paren_string` as input, where each character in this string represents either an open or closed parenthesis `('(' or ')'`. 

This function aims to return a list where each element represents a balanced group of parentheses, without any nesting between these groups.

To achieve this, it uses a stack to keep track of the nested groups of parentheses. It iterates through each character in the provided string:
- If the character is an open parenthesis `(`, it pushes the current group onto the stack and starts a new, empty group. 
- If it's a closed parenthesis `)`, it checks if the stack is empty. If it isn't, the last group pushed onto the stack is popped back into the current group, completing a balanced group. If the stack is empty, it considers this a mismatch, and returns an empty list. 
- For any other character (a regular parenthesis), it adds this character to the current group. 

Once the loop is finished and all nested groups have been properly separated, the function returns a list of these balanced groups, and this result is represented as a list. 

This approach guarantees that every open parenthesis has a matching closed parenthesis, and these groups are not nested within each other. Consequently, it handles the mentioned edge case of spaces within the parentheses gracefully.

The given example in the prompt demonstrates how this function operates and reflects the expected behavior through the returned list of groups.
