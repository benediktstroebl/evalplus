```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []

    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append(')')
            else:
                temp = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(temp)
                if not stack:
                    result.append((').extend(current_group)')
                elif char != ')':
                    current_group.append(')')
                    stack.append(current_group)
                    current_group = []
    return result
```

The code uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. When a '(' is encountered, it pushes the current group onto the stack and starts a new group. When a ')' is encountered, it checks if the current group is empty. If so, it appends the ')' to the result as there are no open parentheses to close. If not, it pops a group from the stack and appends it to the current group. If the current group has only one element and is a ')', it appends it to the result as the group is complete. The process continues until all parentheses are processed.
