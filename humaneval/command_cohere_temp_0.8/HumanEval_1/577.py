```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    result = []

    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = []
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                print('UNBALANCED!)' )
            else:
                temp = stack.pop()
                current_group.extend(temp)
        else:
            current_group.append(char)

    if stack:
        print('UNBALANCED!)' )
    else:
        result.append(''.join(current_group))

    return result
```

The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of nested parentheses groups. When an open parenthesis `(` is encountered, it pushes the current group onto the stack and starts a new empty group. When a close parenthesis `)` is encountered, the algorithm checks if the stack is empty. If so, it means the current group is not properly closed, prints an error message, and returns the result as is. If there is a group on the stack, it pops it and appends its content to the current group. The resulting list of strings is returned after the input string is processed.

This approach ensures that all nested groups are correctly separated and returned, and it handles potential errors due to unbalanced or nested parentheses gracefully. 

Note: This algorithm assumes that the input string contains only parentheses and no other characters. If other characters are present, they may cause unexpected behavior or errors. You can extend the code to handle other characters gracefully if needed.
