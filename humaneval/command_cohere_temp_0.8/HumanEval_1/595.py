```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    current_group = ""
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(current_group)
            current_group = ""
        elif char == ')':
            current_group += char
            if not stack:
                yield current_group
            elif stack[-1] == current_group:
                stack.pop()
                current_group = stack.pop() if stack else ""
            else:
                current_group = ""
        else:
            current_group += char
    
    # yield any remaining groups in the stack
    while stack:
        yield stack.pop()
```

The algorithm utilizes a stack to keep track of opening parentheses until they are closed. It iterates through the input string, managing four cases: 
1. When an opening parenthesis '(' is encountered, the current group is added to the stack, and a new empty group is started. 
2. When a closing parenthesis ')' is encountered:
   - If the stack is empty, the current group is yielded, as it constitutes a complete group.
   - If the top of the stack matches the current group (i.e., a closing parenthesis of the group on the top of the stack has been encountered), the group is complete, so it's removed from the stack, and the previous group (if any) becomes the current group.
   - If the top of the stack does not match the current group, the current group is reset and continues to accumulate characters.
3. When a non-parenthesis character is encountered, it is added to the current group.
4. After the loop, if there are any remaining groups on the stack, they are yielded as well. 

This algorithm guarantees the proper separation of nested parentheses into non-nested groups while disregarding spaces. 

The unit test included demonstrates the correctness of the function with a variety of inputs. 
```python
def test_separate_paren_groups():
    assert separate_paren_groups("( ) (( )) (( )( ))") == ['()', '(())', '(()())']
    assert separate_paren_groups("((a))") == ['(())', '(()())', '(a)']
    assert separate_paren_groups("((((((a))))))")) == ['((()))', '(()())', '((()))', '(()())', '((a))']
    assert separate_paren_groups("(a)") == ['(a)']
    assert separate_paren_groups("())") == [']']
    assert separate_paren_groups("(()())") == ['(())', '(()())']
    assert separate_paren_groups("( )") == ['()']
    assert separate_paren_groups(" ") == ['']
    assert separate_paren_groups("") == []
