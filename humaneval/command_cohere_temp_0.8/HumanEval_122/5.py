Here's a Python script that contains a function to solve the given problem:
```python
def add_elements(arr, k):
    sum_two_digits = 0
    for i in range(k):
        if len(str(arr[i])) <= 2:
            sum_two_digits += arr[i]
    return sum_two_digits

# Example usage:
arr = [111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
k = 4
result = add_elements(arr, k)
print(f"The sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first {k} elements is: {result}")
```

The code defines a function `add_elements` which takes in an array `arr` and an integer `k` as input. It iterates through the first `k` elements of the array, and for each element, it checks if the length of the string representation of the element is less than or equal to 2. If it is, it adds the element to the `sum_two_digits` variable. Finally, it returns the `sum_two_digits` variable. 

The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a sample array and length `k`, and it prints the result accordingly. Make sure to have a `python` interpreter installed and possibly create a dedicated environment for each code snippet for a more organized development approach. You can activate this environment by using the command `python -m venv myenv` and then use the command `source myenv/bin/activate` to activate it. Afterward, you can execute the code in the dedicated environment by simply typing `python` in the terminal.
