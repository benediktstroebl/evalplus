Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the given problem:
```python
def add_elements(arr, k):
    sum_two_digits = 0
    for i in range(k):
        if len(str(arr[i])) <= 2:
            sum_two_digits += arr[i]
    return sum_two_digits

# Example usage
arr = [111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
k = 4
result = add_elements(arr, k)
print(f"Example output: {result}")

```

The function `add_elements` takes an array `arr` and an integer `k` as inputs. It iterates through the first `k` elements of the array and accumulates the sum of elements whose representations (when converted to strings) have at most two digits. The result is then returned as the sum of elements with at most two digits from the first `k` elements of `arr`.
