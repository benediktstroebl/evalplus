Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the given problem:
```python
def add_elements(arr, k):
    sum_two_digits = 0
    for i in range(k):
        if len(str(arr[i])) <= 2:
            sum_two_digits += arr[i]
    return sum_two_digits

# Example usage:
arr = [111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
k = 4
result = add_elements(arr, k)
print(f"The sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first {k} elements is: {result}")
```

The `add_elements` function processes the first `k` elements of the `arr` array and accumulates the sum of elements that have at most two digits. The accompanying comment illustrates how the function operates and includes the output for the example provided in the problem statement.
