Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the given problem:
```python
def add_elements(arr, k):
    sum_two_digits = 0
    for i in range(k):
        if len(str(arr[i])) <= 2:
            sum_two_digits += arr[i]
    return sum_two_digits

# Example usage:
arr = [111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
k = 4
result = add_elements(arr, k)
print(f"Example output: {result}")

```

The function `add_elements` iterates through the first `k` elements of the `arr` list. It calculates the sum of elements whose string representation has at most two digits. The resulting sum is then returned.

The example usage demonstrates the function's behavior on a specific input. The expected output from the example is 24, which is the sum of the first 4 elements of the array whose representation has less than or equal to 2 digits. 

The code passes the test as the output of the function correctly follows the constraint.
