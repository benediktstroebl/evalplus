Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the given problem:
```python
def add_elements(arr, k):
    sum_two_digits = 0
    for i in range(k):
        if len(str(arr[i])) <= 2:
            sum_two_digits += arr[i]
    return sum_two_digits

# Example usage
arr = [111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
k = 4
result = add_elements(arr, k)
print(f"Example output: {result}")

```

The function `add_elements` takes an array `arr` and an integer `k` as input, iterates through the first `k` elements of the array, and accumulates the sum of elements whose representation has at most two digits. The resulting sum is then returned. 

The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with the provided input array `arr` and value of `k` as 4. The output will be:
```
Example output: 24
```

This solution adheres to the given constraints, and the function is self-contained within this script.
