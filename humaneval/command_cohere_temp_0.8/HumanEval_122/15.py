Here's a Python script that contains a function to solve the given problem:
```python
def add_elements(arr, k):
    sum_two_digits = 0
    for i in range(k):
        if len(str(arr[i]))<=2:
            sum_two_digits += arr[i]
    return sum_two_digits
```
This script defines a function called `add_elements` that takes in an array `arr` and an integer `k` as input. The function operates on the first `k` elements of the array and calculates the sum of elements that have at most two digits.

The script aims to solve the challenge of efficiently identifying elements with at most two digits within the first `k` elements of the array. This is achieved by employing a `for` loop to traverse through the first `k` elements of the array. For each element, the script evaluates the length of its string representation, str(arr[i]), to determine if it is less than or equal to 2. If this condition is met, the value of the element is added to the running sum_two_digits.

To optimize the performance of this loop, it is essential to enforce a reasonable limit on the length of the array, ensuring that it does not exceed 100 elements. Additionally, the loop is configured to only iterate up to the first `k` elements of the array, where `k` is also bounded within the length of the array. These constraints are crucial for guaranteeing the efficacy and stability of the algorithm.

This code exemplifies concise algorithmic problem-solving in Python, as it efficiently calculates the desired sum using a loop and len() function. You can integrate it into a test suite to validate its functionality and ensure its efficiency for various input scenarios.
