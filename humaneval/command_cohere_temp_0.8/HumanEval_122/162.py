Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the given problem:
```python
def add_elements(arr, k):
    sum_two_digits = 0
    for i in range(k):
        if len(str(arr[i])) <= 2:
            sum_two_digits += arr[i]
    return sum_two_digits

# Example usage
arr = [111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
k = 4
result = add_elements(arr, k)
print(f"The sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first {k} elements is: {result}")
```

This script defines a function `add_elements` that takes an array `arr` and an integer `k` as input. It iterates through the first `k` elements of the array and accumulates the sum of elements that have at most two digits. The result is then returned.

Let's break down the code:
1. `def add_elements(arr, k)`: This defines a function named `add_elements` that takes two arguments, a list `arr` and an integer `k`.
2. `sum_two_digits = 0`: Initializes a variable `sum_two_digits` to keep track of the sum of elements with at most two digits.
3. `for i in range(k)`: This is a loop that iterates through the first `k` elements of the array.
4. `if len(str(arr[i])) <= 2`: Checks if the length of the string representation of the current element is at most 2. This is used to identify elements with at most two digits.
5. `sum_two_digits += arr[i]`: If the condition is met, the element is added to the sum.
6. After the loop, the function returns the `sum_two_digits`.

The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with the provided array and value of `k`, and then prints the result.
