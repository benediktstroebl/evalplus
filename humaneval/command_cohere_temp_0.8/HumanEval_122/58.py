Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the given problem:
```python
def add_elements(arr, k):
    sum_two_digits = 0
    for i in range(k): 
        num = arr[i]
        if len(str(num))<=2:
            sum_two_digits += num  
    return sum_two_digits

# Example usage
arr = [111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
k = 4
result = add_elements(arr, k)
print(f"Example output: {result}")
```

The script provides a function `add_elements` that takes in an array `arr` and an integer `k` as inputs. It iterates through the first `k` elements of the array, and for each element, it checks if the number of digits in the corresponding string representation is fewer than or equal to 2. If so, it adds the element to the sum `sum_two_digits`. Finally, the function returns this sum, which represents the result of the algorithm.

The example usage is provided in the code and should output the result of 24, as described in the example provided in the problem statement. Let me know if you have any doubts!
