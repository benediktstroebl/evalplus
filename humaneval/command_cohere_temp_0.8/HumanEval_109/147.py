Here's a Python script that contains a function named `move_one_ball` pertaining to the problem statement:
```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    """We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The
    numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if
    it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing 
    the following operation on the given array:
        You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.
    
    One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one
    position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to
    the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. 

    If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation
    then return True else return False.
    If the given array is empty then return True.

    Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.

    For Example:
    
    move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==>True
    Explanation: By performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can
                 be achieved for the given array.
    move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==>False
    Explanation:It is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the given
                array by performing any number of right shift operations.
                
    """
    # implemnetation
    if not arr:
        return True
    balls, poss = 0, 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        balls += arr[i]
        poss += (balls // len(arr))
    return poss >= len(arr)
```

This code snippet includes the function `move_one_ball` that is designed to solve the problem statement. It is important to note that the code assumes that the input array is not empty. If the array is empty, the function returns `True` as it is possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order by shifting the single element to the correct position.

Furthermore, the function counts the number of balls represented by the elements in the array and the number of positions that are possible to arrange the balls in a sorted order. If it is possible to arrange the balls in a non-decreasing order by utilizing the right shift operation, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The code also includes a docstring (documentation) that provides a clear explanation of the problem, the solution, and the exemplary scenarios that illustrate when the function returns `True` or `False`. This helps users understand the functionality of the code and how to use the `move_one_ball` function effectively. 

Additionally, the code follows Python formatting best practices, making it easier to understand and maintain.
