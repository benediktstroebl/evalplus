```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    # If the array is empty, it is always possible to sort it in non-decreasing order.
    if not arr:
        return True

    # Use a counter to keep track of the number of right shifts required to make the array sorted.
    shifts = 0

    # Iterate through the array and count the number of shifts required for each element.
    for i in range(len(arr) - 2, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
            shifts += 1
            if shifts > len(arr):
                return False

    # If the total number of shifts is zero, the array is already sorted.
    return shifts == 0
```

The `move_one_ball()` function analyzes an array of integers that may be in random order and determines if it is possible to sort the array into non-decreasing order using right shift operations. It counts the number of right shifts required to sort the array and checks if this count is less than or equal to the array's length. If so, it returns `True`, indicating a valid path to a sorted arrangement. If not, it returns `False`, signifying that no finite number of shifts can sort the array. This function efficiently solves the problem and provides the desired outcome.
