```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    # If the array is empty, it is always possible to sort it in non-decreasing order.
    if not arr:
        return True

    # Sort the array and remove duplicates
    arr = sorted(set(arr))
    # Create a variable to track if a shift operation is needed
    shift_operation_needed = arr[-1] < arr[0]
    # Iterate through the array to see if a right shift operation is possible
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            shift_operation_needed |= arr[i] < arr[i - 1]

    # If a shift operation is needed, it is possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order
    return not shift_operation_needed
```

This approach first sorts the array and removes duplicates to simplify the problem. It then checks if any elements in the front of the array are smaller than the last element, and if this is the case for any element in the array, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
