Here's a Python script that contains a function named `move_one_ball` inspired by the problem statement provided:
```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    """We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The
    numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if
    it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing 
    the following operation on the given array:
        You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.
    
    One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one
    position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to
    the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. 

    If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation
    then return True else return False.
    If the given array is empty then return True.

    Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.

    For Example:
    
    move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==>True
    Explanation: By performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can
                 be achieved for the given array.
    move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==>False
    Explanation:It is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the given
                array by performing any number of right shift operations.
                
    """
    # empty array, any number of shift operations will work
    if len(arr)==0:
        return True
    # single element array, will always be non decreasing order
    if len(arr)==1:
        return True
    # binary search for the question move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==>False
    # return False if it is impossible to perform any number of shifts
    if arr[0]<=arr[1]:
        return False
    # sorting the array and return True if it is possible to get non decreasing
    # order by performing any number of shifts.
    arr.sort()
    return arr[0]<=arr[1]
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # test sceneraio for the move_one_ball function
    assert move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2]) == True
    assert move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2]) == False
    assert move_one_ball([2, 3, 4, 5, 1]) == True
    assert move_one_ball([7, 4, 1, 3, 6]) == True
    assert move_one_ball([4, 7, 2, 3, 5]) == False
    assert move_one_ball([2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == True
```
This script will determine if a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by shifting elements to the right. The function returns True if it's possible and False if it's not. You can modify the assert statements to test different arrays and verify the function's behavior against your expectations.
