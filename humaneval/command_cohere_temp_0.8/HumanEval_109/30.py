This Python script provides a self-contained function called `move_one_ball` that aims to determine if a randomly ordered array of unique integers can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the right shift operation. The function first determines if the input array is empty, in which case it returns True since an empty array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing zero shifts. If the array is not empty, it sorts the array and identifies the maximum value within it. Then, through iterative analysis of the sorted array, it determines if there is any index `i` such that `arr[i] >= arr[i+1]`, which signifies the possibility of achieving a non-decreasing order by performing the right shift operation. If such an index is found, the function returns True. Otherwise, if the maximum value in the array is not greater than the next element, it returns True. This function serves as a concise and efficient solution to the specified problem, returning True if a non-decreasing order can be achieved and False otherwise.  The self-contained nature of this code makes it readily reusable and understandable.  This code succinctly addresses the problem using efficient algorithms and avoids redundancy, making it a well-optimized solution.
