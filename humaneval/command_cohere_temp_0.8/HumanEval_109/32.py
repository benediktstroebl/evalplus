Here's a Python script that contains a function named `move_one_ball` inspired by the problem statement provided:
```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    # Base case: If the array is empty, it's already sorted
    if not arr:
        return True

    # Sort the array and check if it's sorted in ascending order
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr)
    return sorted_arr == arr
```

This function works by first checking if the array is empty. If it is, then the function returns True since an empty array is already sorted. Otherwise, it sorts the array and compares it with the original array. If they are equal, it means the array is sorted in ascending order, and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

The overall time complexity of this algorithm is O(N log N) due to the sorting operation (`sorted()` function). Remember that the provided example is just one possible approach to solving this problem, and there might be other ways to achieve better time or space complexity depending on the actual inputs and constraints.  Normally the `sorted()` function takes in a key parameter to specify a particular attribute of each list member that is used to determine the sorting order. In this case, since that parameter is not utilized, the members of the list are sorted in the default order, which is usually ascending based on the numerical value of the elements.
