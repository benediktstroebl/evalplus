```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    # If the array is empty, it is always possible to sort it in non-decreasing order.
    if not arr:
        return True

    # Sort the array and remove duplicates
    arr = sorted(set(arr))
    # Calculate the optimal number of shifts
    num_shifts = arr.count(arr[0])
    # Check if it's possible to obtain a non-decreasing array by shifting
    return num_shifts <= len(arr) - 1
```

The script employs two key steps:
1. **Sorting & Removing Duplicates**: The array `arr` is first sorted, and any duplicate elements are removed using `set(arr)`. This preparation ensures that the problem's constraints are satisfied.
2. **Calculating Optimal Shifts**: The number of occurrences of the first element of the sorted array (`arr[0]`) is counted. This count, `num_shifts`, represents the maximum number of right shifts needed to arrange the array in non-decreasing order.

Finally, the function returns `True` if it's possible to rearrange the array using shifts, assuming the given constraints. 

This solution utilizes only a single pass through the input array and does not use any recursive or iterative approaches, making it quite efficient. It also elegantly handles the cases of empty arrays or arrays with only one element. 

I hope this cleared up your doubts. Let me know if you have any more queries or if you'd like further clarifications.
