```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    # If the array is empty, it is always possible to sort it in non-decreasing order.
    if not arr:
        return True

    # Check if the last element is the smallest and there is at least one element behind it.
    if arr[-1] >= arr[0] and len(arr) > 1:
        return False

    # If the condition above is not met, we can shift the last element to the first position
    # and get a non-decreasing array.
    return move_one_ball(arr[:-1] + [arr[-1]])
```

The approach used in this code is a recursive approach. It checks if the last element in the array is the smallest and if there's at least one element after it. If this condition is not met, it proceeds to shift the last element to the first position and checks if the new array can be sorted by repeating the process. If the array is empty or the condition is met, it returns True and False, respectively.
