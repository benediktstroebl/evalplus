This Python script defines a function called `move_one_ball` that, given an array of integers `arr`, determines if it is possible to sort `arr` in non-decreasing order by shifting all of its elements right by one position. This function returns `True` if this operation is possible and `False` otherwise. This function first checks if the input array is empty, and if so, it always considers the operation successful, returning `True.` Further, this function employs some optimizations to reduce the complexity of the problem when possible, as the underlying presence of unique elements in the array is exploited. This function is warranted to work correctly for all unique inputs in the provided Markdown problem statement.
