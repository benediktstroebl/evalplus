```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    # If the array is empty, it is always possible to sort it in non-decreasing order.
    if not arr:
        return True

    # Sort the array and remove duplicates
    arr = sorted(set(arr))
    # Determine the number of shifts required to sort the array in non-decreasing order
    shifts = sum(1 for i in range(1, len(arr)) if arr[i] >= arr[i-1])
    # Return False if it is not possible to achieve non-decreasing order with right shifts
    return shifts == 0
```

The code first processes edge cases by checking if the input array is empty. If the array is empty, the function returns True as it is possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order by shifting the last element to the 0th index, no matter what the value of the last element is.

If the array is not empty, the function proceeds to sort the array and removes duplicate elements. By performing these two operations, the function prepares the array to determine if it is possible to achieve non-decreasing order by shifting only one ball. The function calculates the number of shifts required to achieve non-decreasing order with a while loop, and if the sum of the number of shifts is not equal to 0, it returns False. If the sum is equal to 0, it returns True. 

This algorithm has a time complexity of `O(n log(n))`, where `n` is the length of the input array. This is because the algorithm requires first sorting the array, which has a time complexity of `O(n log(n))`, and then removing duplicates, which has a time complexity of `O(n)`.
