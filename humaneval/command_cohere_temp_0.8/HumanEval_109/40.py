```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    # If the array is empty, it is always possible to sort it in non-decreasing order.
    if not arr:
        return True

    # Sort the array and remove duplicates
    arr = sorted(set(arr))
    # Determine the number of shifts required to sort the array in non-decreasing order
    return len(arr) == 1 or arr[1] - arr[0] <= 1
```

The `move_one_ball` function sorts the array and removes duplicates, then compares the difference between the first and second values to determine if it is less than or equal to 1. If so, it returns `True`, indicating that the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order through shifting; otherwise, it returns `False`. This approach ensures that the operation can be completed in the fewest shifts without any duplicates affecting the result.
