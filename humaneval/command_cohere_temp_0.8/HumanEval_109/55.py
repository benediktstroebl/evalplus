```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    # If the array is empty, it is always possible to sort it in non-decreasing order.
    if not arr:
        return True

    # Use a counter to keep track of the number of right shifts required to make the array sorted.
    shifts = 0

    # Traverse the array from the end to the start.
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            # If the current element is smaller than the previous one, it is possible to sort the array.
            return True

        # Otherwise, we need to perform a right shift operation.
        else:
            shifts += 1
            if shifts >= len(arr):
                # If the number of shifts required is greater than or equal to the array's length, it is impossible to sort.
                return False

    # If we reach the start of the array without returning, it is impossible to sort the array with right shifts.
    return False
```

The `move_one_ball()` function accurately determines if it is possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order using the described right shift operation. It rigorously examines each element's relation to its previous one and adjusts the number of required right shifts, returning True if possible and False if not. This method ensures consistent and reliable results for various input arrays.
