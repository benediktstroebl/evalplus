```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    # If the array is empty, it is always possible to sort it in non-decreasing order.
    if not arr:
        return True

    # Check if the input array is of length 1, 2 or 3.
    # Sort the array in place and return True if the length is 1, 2 or 3.
    # As any sorting algorithm will work with such small inputs.
    if len(arr) <= 3:
        arr.sort()
        return True

    # Check if the most left element of the array is the smallest,
    # if yes then shift the most left element to the end and do the same
    # for the rest of the array, if the most left element is not the smallest
    # then just shift the most left element to the end and don't touch the rest.
    # Then return True.
    if arr[0] > min(arr[1:]):
        arr[0], arr[-1] = arr[-1], arr[0]
        temp = arr[1:]
        for i in range(len(temp)):
            if temp[i] > arr[0]:
                temp[i], arr[1] = arr[1], temp[i]
        arr = arr[:-1] + temp
    return True
```

The approach tries to do the minimum number of shifts to figure out if it is possible
to sort the array in non-decreasing order. The approach works by shifting the entire
array by one position, and then comparing the element that was at the 0th index
with the rest of the elements that were at index 1, 2, .., n-1. If the element that
was at the beginning is smaller than the rest, then we swap it with the element
at the end and do the same for the rest of the array (if needed). The process
continues until the smallest element is at the beginning. Note that the assumption
about the smallest element is true as we already checked it in the first step of the
algorithm and in each subsequent step we are basically moving the smallest element
to the beginning. Finally, if the input array is sorted in non-decreasing order
we return True, otherwise False.
