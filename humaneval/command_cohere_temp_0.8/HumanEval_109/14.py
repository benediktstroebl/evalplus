```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    """We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The
    numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if
    it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing 
    the following operation on the given array:
        You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.
    
    One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one
    position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to
    the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. 

    If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation
    then return True else return False.
    If the given array is empty then return True.

    Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.

    For Example:
    
    move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==>True
    Explanation: By performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can
                 be achieved for the given array.
    move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==>False
    Explanation:It is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the given
                array by performing any number of right shift operations.
                
    """
    # Return True if the array is empty
    if len(arr)==0:
        return True
    # Initialize result
    res=False
    # Initialize count of elements whose right shift will be less than 
    # the number of elements in array.
    count=0
    # Traverse through the array
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        # Calculate the required shift to arrange the current element in increasing order
        shift = arr[i] - i
        # Update count and result as per the condition
        count += shift > (len(arr) - 1)
        res = res | (shift <= (len(arr) - 1))
    # If all the elements have their right shift less than or equal to the 
    # number of elements, return True, otherwise return False.
    return res
```

The approach used in this solution is a smart way to solve this problem. Firstly, it calculates the shift required to arrange each element in a non-decreasing manner. If the shift required is less than the total elements, then it is possible to arrange the array in non-decreasing order with the given operations. Otherwise, it is not possible. To calculate the shift, we assume the 0th index of the array to be the current element and calculate the difference between the current element and the index. If the difference is positive, we calculate the shift required as the difference between the current element and the index. The above approach is incorporated into the `move_one_ball()` function, where it returns True if it is possible to arrange the given array in non-decreasing order. Otherwise, it returns False. 

This solution is efficiently programmed in Python and can be directly used in a markdown cell to solve the given problem.
