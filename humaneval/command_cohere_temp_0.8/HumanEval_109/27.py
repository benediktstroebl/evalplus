Here's a Python script that contains a function named `move_one_ball` inspired by the problem statement provided:
```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    """We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The
    numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if
    it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing 
    the following operation on the given array:
        You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.
    
    One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one
    position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to
    the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. 

    If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation
    then return True else return False.
    If the given array is empty then return True.

    Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.

    For Example:
    
    move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==>True
    Explanation: By performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can
                 be achieved for the given array.
    move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==>False
    Explanation:It is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the given
                array by performing any number of right shift operations.
                
    """
    # Initialize result
    result = False

    # Check if the array is empty
    if len(arr) == 0:
        return True

    # Sort the array
    arr.sort()

    # Initialize count of elements shifted
    count = 0

    # Iterate over the sorted array
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        # If elements are not in non-decreasing order, return False
        if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
            return False

        # If elements are in non-decreasing order, increment count
        elif arr[i] <= arr[i + 1]:
            count += 1

    # If all elements were in non-decreasing order, return True
    return count == len(arr) and result
```

This `move_one_ball` function sorts the input list and then checks if the sorted list comprises a non-decreasing sequence of elements. If the sorted list is non-decreasing, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function is designed to handle both cases, including an empty input list, and will return `True` for any empty input. 

You can use this function to test it with different input lists to see whether it moves one ball to achieve a non-decreasing order.
