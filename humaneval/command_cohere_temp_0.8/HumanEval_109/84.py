```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    # If the array is empty, it is always possible to sort it in non-decreasing order
    if not arr:
        return True

    # Use a counter to keep track of the number of right shifts required to sort the array
    max_shifts = 0

    # Iterate through the array and determine the maximum number of right shifts needed for each element
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        # Calculate the number of shifts needed to move the current element to the first position
        shifts = arr[i] - i
        # Update the maximum number of shifts needed for any element in the array
        max_shifts = max(max_shifts, shifts)

    # Return False if the maximum number of shifts is greater than the length of the array
    return max_shifts <= len(arr)
```

This Python script defines a function called `move_one_ball` that takes an array (`arr`) as input. This function returns `True` if it is possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order by performing a right shift operation any number of times. The function returns `False` if it is not possible to sort the array in this way. The function returns `True` if the array is empty. 

The function logic includes a counter to keep track of the number of right shifts required to sort the array. The function iterates through the array, calculating the number of shifts needed to move each element to the first position. The function then checks if the maximum number of shifts needed for any element in the array is greater than the length of the array. If it is, it returns `False` because it is not possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order with right shifts. If the maximum number of shifts is less than or equal to the array length, it returns `True` as it is possible to sort the array by performing the right shift operation the maximum number of shifts times. 

The expected time complexity of the function is `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input array. This is because the function iterates through the array once, performing a constant-time operation for each element. 

The space complexity is `O(1)`, which means that the function uses a constant amount of additional space regardless of the size of the input array. This is because the function does not allocate any additional space for storing the input array or any other data structure. Instead, it operates directly on the input array, which is passed as an argument to the function.  */
