```python
def total_match(lst1, lst2):
    char_count_1 = sum(len(el) for el in lst1)
    char_count_2 = sum(len(el) for el in lst2)
    if char_count_1 == char_count_2:
        return lst1
    elif char_count_1 < char_count_2:
        return lst2
    else:
        return lst1
```
The code defines a function `total_match` which takes two lists of strings, `lst1` and `lst2` as arguments. The goal is to return the list with a total character count in all its strings less than the other list's total character count. If both lists have an equal character count, it returns the first list (`lst1`).

The function sums the lengths of all strings in both lists using `sum()` and `len()`. Afterwards, it checks which list has the least total character count and returns it. The default argument for `sum()` is `float`, thus `char_count_1` and `char_count_2` are both typed as `float`, ensuring the comparison works as intended. The code includes examples showcasing different scenarios and tests to verify the function's correctness.

```python
test_total_match = '''
>>> total_match([], [])
[]

>>> total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'Hi'])
['hI', 'Hi']

>>> total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hi', 'hi', 'admin', 'project'])
['hi', 'admin']

>>> total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hi'])
['hI', 'hi', 'hi']

>>> total_match(['4'], ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5'])
['4']

>>> total_match(['hi', 'hello'], ['hello', 'hello'])
['hello', 'hello']
'''
``` 
The test suite contains examples covering all scenarios mentioned in the problem statement to verify the function's correctness.
