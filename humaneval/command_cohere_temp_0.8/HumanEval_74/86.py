```python
def total_match(lst1, lst2):
    return lst1 if len(lst1) == len(lst2) else len(lst1) < len(lst2) and lst1 or lst2
```
This Python script defines a function called `total_match` that takes two lists of strings, `lst1` and `lst2`, as input. The purpose of this function is to return the list that has the total number of characters in all of its strings less than the other list. If the two lists have the same number of characters, it returns the first list (`lst1`).

The function starts by checking if the lengths of both lists are equal. If they are, it returns `lst1`, assuming that it's preferable to retain the list with more unique elements when the char count is the same.

If the lengths are not the same, it further checks if `lst1` has less than `lst2` total characters in its strings. If it does, it returns `lst1`, otherwise, it returns `lst2`. This logic ensures that the function returns the list that has the most selective strings when reducing the overall character count.
