```python
def total_match(lst1, lst2):
    l1_total = sum(len(x) for x in lst1)
    l2_total = sum(len(x) for x in lst2)
    if l1_total < l2_total:
        return lst1
    elif l2_total < l1_total:
        return lst2
    else:
        return lst1 if len(lst1) < len(lst2) else lst2
```

The solution utilizes two summations initially to figure out which list has fewer characters altogether. If both lists have the same quantity of characters, the solution employs the list length as a tie-breaker to select which list to return.
