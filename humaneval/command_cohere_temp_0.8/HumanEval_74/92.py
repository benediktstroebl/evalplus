```python
def total_match(lst1, lst2):
    l1_total = sum(len(x) for x in lst1)
    l2_total = sum(len(x) for x in lst2)
    if l1_total < l2_total:
        return lst1
    elif l2_total < l1_total:
        return lst2
    else:
        return [x for x in lst1 if x not in lst2]
```

The problem is to write a function that accepts two lists of strings and returns the list that has the total number of chars in all strings of the list less than the other list. If the two lists have the same number of chars, return the first list.

Examples:
```python
print(total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'Hi'])) # ['hI', 'Hi']
print(total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hi', 'hi', 'admin', 'project'])) # ['hi', 'admin']
print(total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hi'])) # ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']
print(total_match(['4'], ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5'])) # ['4']
``` 

The provided code solves the problem by first calculating the total character length of the strings in each list, using the `sum()` function with a `len()` generator expression. Then, it compares the total character counts of both lists and returns the list with the fewer total characters. If both lists have the same total character count, it iterates through the first list and excludes elements that are also present in the second list, finally returning the modified list.
