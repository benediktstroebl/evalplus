```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    # Initialize the smallest change to an excessively large value
    smallest_change = float('inf')
    
    # Calculate the smallest change for reversing the array
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
            # Swap arr[i] and arr[j]
            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
            count_reversal = 0
            for k in range(len(arr)):
                if arr[k] != arr[len(arr) - 1 - k]:
                    count_reversal += 2  # Value to be changed and its mirror-image value in reverse array
            smallest_change = min(smallest_change, count_reversal)
            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]  # Swap back to original arrangement

    return smallest_change
```

The function `smallest_change()` iterates through each element in the array, trying to find a pair of elements that can be swapped to form a palindrome. It analyzes all possible pairs and determines the minimum number of changes required, which is returned as the result.

This solution effectively solves the problem and should produce the correct output for the given test cases. Please note that this solution uses a brute-force approach, and there might be more efficient algorithms to solve this problem using sorting or dynamic programming techniques.
