The `smallest_change` function takes an array of integers `arr` as input. It initializes two dictionaries, `forward` and `backward`, which store the counts of each number and its reverse in the array. Then, it calculates the minimum number of changes required to make the array palindromic, assuming each change can transform one element into any other element. The function returns the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic. 

Note that this solution assumes that the array contains only unique integers, which is not explicitly mentioned in the problem statement but is necessary for this algorithm to work.
