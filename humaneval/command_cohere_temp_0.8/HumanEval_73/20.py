The function takes an array of integers as input and returns the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic. The function first removes any duplicates from the array and ensures the array is even in length, returning `len(arr) // 2 + 1` if it is not even. It then calculates the midpoint of the array and checks if the starting and ending halves are the same, returning 0 if they are. Finally, it counts the number of common elements in the starting and ending halves and returns the minimum of those and the midpoint count. 

The expected time complexity of the solution is O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input array, as the algorithm iterates over the array once to calculate the palindrome count.
