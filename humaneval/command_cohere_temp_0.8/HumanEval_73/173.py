```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of changes required.
    """
    # Ensure the array contains only unique integers.
    arr = list(set(arr))
    # Sort the array.
    arr.sort()
    # Calculate the mid index.
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    # Calculate the number of changes required.
    if arr[0] == arr[mid]:
        return sum((x != arr[0] for x in arr[:mid])) + sum((x != arr[0] for x in arr[mid+1:]))
    else:
        return sum((x != arr[0] for x in arr))
```

The function takes an array of integers as input and handles the problems within the function to return the minimum number of changes required to make the array palindromic. To achieve this:
- The function ensures the array contains only unique integers and sorts it.
- It calculates the mid index of the array.
- If the first and mid elements are the same, the function calculates the number of changes required for the first half and second half separately.
- If the first and mid elements are different, the function calculates the number of changes required for the entire array.

This approach optimizes the calculation and provides a more efficient solution.
