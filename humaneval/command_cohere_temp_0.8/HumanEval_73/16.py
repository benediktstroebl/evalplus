```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    # Initialize the result to the length of the array
    result = len(arr)

    # Loop through the array and reduce result if a pair is found
    for i in range(len(arr)-1):
        if arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - 1 - i]:
            result = min(result, 2)

    # Loop through the array and reduce result if a triple is found
    for i in range(len(arr)-2):
        if arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - 1 - i] and arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - 2 - i]:
            result = min(result, 3)

    # Check for consecutive duplicates
    for i in range(len(arr)-1):
        if arr[i] == arr[i+1]:
            result = min(result, arr.count(arr[i])-1)

    return result
```

The function `smallest_change` takes an array `arr` as input and returns the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic.

The approach works by:
- Initializing the result to the length of the array as a worst-case scenario. 
- Then, it checks for pairs and triples and reduces the result accordingly.
- Finally, it checks for consecutive duplicates and adjusts the result. 

This approach assumes that changing one element of a duplicate pair or triple to another element of that same pair or triplet is considered a single change.

Please note that the code assumes that the array elements are integers and may need modifications to handle other data types.
