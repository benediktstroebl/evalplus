Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem using Python:
```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    changed = 0
    for a, b in zip(arr, arr[1:][::-1]):
        if a != b:
            changed += 1
    return changed
```
This function solves the problem using a **single pass** through the input array, counting the number of times the elements don't match their corresponding elements in reverse order. This counts the number of changes needed, which is the smallest number of changes necessary to make the array palindic. This approach is efficient and aligns with the idea of making the minimum number of changes described in the problem statement. Here's a brief explanation:
1. `changed = 0` Initiates a counter to keep track of elements that need changing. 
2. `for a, b in zip(arr, arr[1:][::-1])` Iterates through each element `a` in the array `arr`, and its corresponding element `b` in the reversed array `arr[1:][::-1]`. In a palindrome, these would be the same. 
3. `if a != b` Checks if the elements don't match, this is a chance to make the array palindic by changing one element. The counter `changed` is incremented. 
4. `return changed` Returns the final count, which is the smallest change to make the array palindic. 
This approach finds the answer for the given examples like: `[1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]` which needs 4 changes, `[1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]` which needs 1 change, and `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]` which needs 0 changes.
