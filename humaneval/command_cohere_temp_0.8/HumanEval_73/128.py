```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    arr.sort()
    changes = 0
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            changes += 1
    return changes
```

The function `smallest_change` takes an array `arr` as input and sorts it in ascending order. It then iterates over the array, comparing each element to the previous one. If they are not equal, it increments the changes count. Finally, it returns the number of changes needed to make the array palindromic.

This approach takes advantage of the fact that identical adjacent elements in a sorted array reflect a potential palindromic subarray and focuses on changing elements that violate this symmetry. As a result, it calculates the minimum changes needed to achieve palindromic symmetry. 

Note: This approach uses a technique that solves the problem in linear time `O(n)` and uses the built-in sort function providing an efficient solution.
