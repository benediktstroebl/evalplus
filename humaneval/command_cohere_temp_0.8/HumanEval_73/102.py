```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of changes required
    """
    # Ensure the array contains only unique integers
    arr = list(set(arr))
    # Create a reversed copy of the array
    rev = arr[:]
    rev.reverse()
    # Calculate the delta between the array and its reverse
    delta = [x for x in arr if x != rev]
    return len(delta)
```

The function `smallest_change` calculates the difference between the original array and its reverse, identifying the elements that would need to be changed to create a palindrome. To ensure efficiency, the function works only with unique elements, avoiding unnecessary computations with duplicate items. This approach allows it to solve the problem correctly and efficiently.
