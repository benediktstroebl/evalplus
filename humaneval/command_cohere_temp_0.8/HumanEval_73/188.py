```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    arr = list(set(arr))
    return sum((x + 1) % 2 for x in range(len(arr)) if arr[x] != arr[-(x + 1) % len(arr)]);
```

The function `smallest_change` takes an array of integers as input and returns the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic. The function utilizes the set method to remove duplicate elements and calculates the differences between adjacent elements to determine the change increments. It counts the number of elements that require a change and returns the minimum count among all possible changes.

The logic of the provided solution is to iterate over the array and compare each element with the corresponding element in the reverse sequence. If the elements are not the same, they are swapped to achieve the palindrome goal. The function counts the number of swaps required to reach the palindrome and returns this count as the result.

This solution assumes that the input array contains only unique integers. If the input array contains duplicate elements, the behavior of the function is not guaranteed. Also, this solution takes advantage of the fact that the number of changes is calculated at the end of the session, so it does not need to care about the intermediate changes.
