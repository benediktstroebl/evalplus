    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

This script defines a function `smallest_change` that takes in an array of integers as input and returns the minimum number of changes required to make the array palindromic. The function first converts the array to a set to remove any duplicate elements, then determines if the length of the array is even or odd to calculate the number of pairs and halves, respectively. The correct number of changes is returned based on this determination. The script also includes tests that verify the function's behavior for different input arrays.
