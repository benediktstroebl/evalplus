    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that

    # Loop through the array from the first to the last element.
    for i in range(1, n):
        # If the current element is not equal to the element at the same index

The algorithm to solve the problem involves making the array symmetrical by finding the midpoint and then comparing each element to its palindromic pair. This is done in the following steps:
1. Remove duplicates from the array. This is done using the `set()` method which removes duplicate values automatically, and then convert it back to a list.
2. Sort the array. This is done using the `sort()` method, which makes the array ordered, which is necessary for the next steps.
3. Calculate the length of the array. This is done using the `len()` method.
4. Initialize the result. The result is initially set to half the length of the array. This assumption is that the array is already palindromic up to the middle, so no changes are required in this area.
5. Loop through the array. This is done using a loop that goes from the first element to the last.
6. Check for changes. In the loop, for each element, it compares it to its 'mirror image', the element at the same index in the reverse order of the sorted array. If they are different, it means that changes are required to make the array palindromic at these positions.
7. Update the result. If changes are required, the result is incremented by 1.

The algorithm optimizes for the case where the array is already close to being palindic, which is common in practice, as most inputs will not have too many changes required.
