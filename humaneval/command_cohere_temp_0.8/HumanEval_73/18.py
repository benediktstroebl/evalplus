Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] != arr[i-1]:
            count += 1
    return count
```
This function `smallest_change(arr)` determines the total number of mismatched elements in the array by iterating through the array, comparing each element to its preceding element, and incrementing the count whenever they are different. The resulting count is the minimum number of changes required to make the array palindromic.

To ensure the above function behaves accordingly, it is vital to define an appropriate testing dataset to validate the function's behavior against it:
```python
# Testing dataset
tests = [
    ([1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6], 4),
    ([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2], 1),
    ([1, 2, 3, 2, 1], 0),
    ([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], 2),
    ([9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 3)
]

# Iterate through the testing dataset and check if the function's output matches the expected output
for arr, expected in tests:
    assert smallest_change(arr) == expected
```

Here, `tests` is a list of tuples, each of which consists of an array and the expected minimum change value for that array. We iterate through this list, calling the `smallest_change` function and comparing its output with the expected value of the test case, using the `assert` statement to check if they match. 

This approach enables the function's effectiveness in solving the problem to be assessed rigorously.
