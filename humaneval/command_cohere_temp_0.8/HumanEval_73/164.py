```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    # Initialize the smallest change to a large value
    smallest_change = float('inf')
    
    # Initialize a count of changes to 0
    changes_count = 0
    
    # Iterate over the list of integers
    for element in arr:
        # Check if the element is already in the correct position for being a palindrome
        if element == arr[::-1][index]:
            continue
        
        # Calculate the change by subtracting 2 from the absolute difference
        change = abs(element - arr[::-1][index]) - 2
        
        # Update the smallest change and count of changes
        smallest_change = min(smallest_change, change)
        changes_count += 1
    
    return smallest_change if smallest_change != float('inf') else changes_count
```

The algorithm operates by iterating through each element in the array. It calculates the change required to amend each element to its counterpart in the reverse sequence. The level of change is determined by subtracting 2 from the absolute difference between the two elements. This is done to incentivize changing the element to its closest counterpart, which usually requires a change of one. If the element is already in the correct position in the reverse sequence, it is skipped. The process then identifies the smallest change among all the changes computed and returns it. If the smallest change is still infinity, meaning no elements need changing, it returns 0.
