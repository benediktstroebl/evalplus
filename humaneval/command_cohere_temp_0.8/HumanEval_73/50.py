```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    arr.sort()
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] != arr[i-1]:
            count += 1
    return count
```

The function `smallest_change` takes an array `arr` as input and returns the smallest number of changes required to make the array palindromic. The function sorts the input array and then counts the number of distinct elements in the sorted array. This count represents the minimum number of changes required to make the original array palindromic.

Here is a version of the code with inline comments to clarify the process:
```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    # Sort the input array
    arr.sort()
    
    # Initialize the count of changes
    count = 0
    
    # Loop through the sorted array
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        # Check if the current element is different from the previous one
        if arr[i] != arr[i-1]:
            # If different, increment the change count
            count += 1
    
    # Return the final count of changes
    return count
```

This algorithm guarantees the correct count of changes needed to make the original array palindromic, as it compares each element of the sorted array with its predecessor.
