```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

    Returns:
        integer : Minimum number of changes required to make the array palindromic. 
    """
    # Ensure the array contains only unique integers
    arr = list(set(arr))
    # Determine the middle index of the array
    middle = len(arr) // 2
    # Initialize the changes count
    changes = 0
    # Iterate through the array from both sides
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        # Compare the element to it's counterpart in reverse order
        if arr[i] != arr[middle - i]:
            changes += 1
            # Optionally change the element to it's opposite to simulate a change
            arr[i] = arr[middle - i]
    return changes
```

The function compares adjacent elements from both ends of the array, and counts the differences. Then, it simulates changing elements to their opposite to minimize the count. To make the function work correctly and return the expected results for all test cases, it is necessary to ensure that the array contains only unique elements.

The problem is essentially a sorting issue, where you can consider the problem as finding the fewest moves to sort a list of distinct integers. It's a fun problem with a clever algorithmic solution. I hope this code block serves as a reusable unit to solve this specific problem.
