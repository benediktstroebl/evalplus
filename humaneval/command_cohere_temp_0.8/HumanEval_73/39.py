Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    changed = 0
    for a, b in zip(arr, arr[1:][::-1]):
        if a != b:
            changed += 1
    return changed
```
The function `smallest_change` takes an array `arr` as input and returns the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic. The function uses a for loop to unzip the array and compare each element to its corresponding element in the reversed sequence. It counts the elements that don't match and returns the total count. Such elements would need to be changed to create a palindrome. This approach is efficient and solves the problem with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array.  This method is also intimately tied to the definition of a palindrome, which reinforces the concept of changing elements to match.
