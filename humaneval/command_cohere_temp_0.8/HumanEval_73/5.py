```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    # Initialize the result to the length of the array
    result = len(arr)
    
    # Consider all elements one by one
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        # Try making all elements equal to the i'th element
        for e in arr:
            test_arr = arr.copy()
            test_arr[i] = e
            test_arr[i ^ 1] = e
            if test_arr == sorted(test_arr):
                result = min(result, 1)
                break
    
    return result
```

The function `smallest_change()` iterates through each element in the input array and considers making all other elements equal to the current element. It then checks if the modified array is palindic by sorting it and comparing it to the original array. If it is palindic, the result is updated to the minimum number of changes, 1 in this case, and the loop continues. After processing all elements, the final result is returned.
