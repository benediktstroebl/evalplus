```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of changes required
    """
    # Ensure the array contains only unique integers. This guarantees that the minimum
    # number of changes is achieved by changing each element to the same value.
    arr.sort()
    unique_arr = list(set(arr))
    len_arr = len(arr)

    # Create a reversed copy of the array and increment a change counter for each element
    # that is different between the two copies.
    changes = 0
    reversed_arr = arr[::-1]
    for i in range(len_arr):

    return changes
```

The Python script uses a simple algorithm to solve the problem in O(n), where n is the length of the input array. The algorithm first sorts the array to group like elements together, then creates a reversed copy of the array and counts the number of elements that differ between the two. The result is the minimum number of changes required to make the array palindromic.
