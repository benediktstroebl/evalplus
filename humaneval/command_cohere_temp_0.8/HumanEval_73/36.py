```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    arr = list(set(arr))
    return sum((arr[i] != arr[-1-i] for i in range(len(arr) // 2)))
```

The function `smallest_change()` works by first removing all duplicates from the input array using the `set()` function, which ensures that each element is only counted once. It then checks if the first half and second half of the array are mirror reflections of each other using a Generator Expression (a golfing trick to save parentheses). The sum function then calculates the total number of elements that differ between the two halves.

This solution employs a clever use of set() and generator expressions to achieve the maximum efficiency of `O(n)`, where 'n' is the length of the input array. 

The provided solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it an optimal solution for this problem. 

This problem can be approached using a variety of methods, including iterative approaches, sorting, or dynamic programming. The method used here is a simple and elegant reflection approach.
