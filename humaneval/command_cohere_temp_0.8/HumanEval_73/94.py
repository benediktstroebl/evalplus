```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of changes required
    """
    # Ensure the array contains only unique integers
    arr = list(set(arr))
    # Create a reversed copy of the array
    rev = arr[::-1]
    # Calculate the absolute difference between the two arrays
    diff = [abs(x-y) for x, y in zip(arr, rev)]
    return min(diff)
```

The function `smallest_change` takes an array of integers as input and returns the minimum number of changes required to make the array palindromic. To do this, it first converts the array to a list of unique elements, then creates a reversed copy of the array and calculates the absolute difference between the two arrays. The minimal count is returned as the result.

To test this function, you can use the following simple test cases:
```python
test_cases = [
    ([1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6], 4),
    ([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2], 1),
    ([1, 2, 3, 2, 1], 0),
    ([], 0),
    ([1], 1),
    ([1, 2], 1),
    ([1, 2, 3], 2),
    ([1, 2, 3, 4], 3)
]

for arr, expected in test_cases:
    print(f'Test Case: {arr}, Expected: {expected}, Actual: {smallest_change(arr)}')
```

This will provide confidence that the function correctly solves the problem and produces the expected results for various inputs.
