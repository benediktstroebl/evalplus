The `smallest_change` function calculates the minimum number of changes required to make an array palindromic, it first checks if the array length is odd, and returns the length-1 if so, as an odd-length array cannot be palindromic. Otherwise, it initializes two variables to keep track of the changes required for the first and second half of the array. It then iterates through the array, comparing each element to its mirror (the element at the same index in the reverse order) and increments the changes count accordingly. Finally, it returns the minimum of the two changes required counts, providing the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic.  This approach is efficient and has a time complexity of `O(n^2)` where `n` is the length of the input array.  This is because we have to iterate through the array twice, and at each step, we compare an element with another one. Thus resulting in a total of `n^2` comparisons.
