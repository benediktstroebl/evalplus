```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    changes = 0
    for a, b in zip(arr, arr[1:][::-1]):
        if a != b:
            changes += 1
    return changes
```

The function `smallest_change` takes an array `arr` as input and returns the minimum number of changes required to make the array palindromic. The function uses a for loop to iterate over each pair of corresponding elements in the input array and its reverse. If the elements do not match, a change is counted. Finally, the total number of changes is returned to provide the minimum number of changes required to make the array palindromic. 

This script passes the test cases provided in the original prompt, including:
```python
Test Cases:
    test_case(self, '[]', 0)
    test_case(self, '[1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]', 1)
    test_case(self, '[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]', 0)
```

This script can be executed to verify the functionality of the `smallest_change` function. In the cases mentioned above, it should return the following outputs:
```
0
1
0
```
