    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

        Minimum number of changes required

    # Ensure the array contains only unique integers
    arr = list(set(arr))
    # Determine the middle index of the array
    middle_index = len(arr) // 2
    # Initialize the changes required to 0
    changes = 0
    # Iterate through the list looking for odd numbers that are not part of a pair
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        # Check if the element is odd and not a pair
        if arr[i] % 2 != 0 and i - middle_index not % 2:
            # Count the odd numbers that are not part of a pair
            changes += 1
        # Check if an element has a pair later in the array
        if i > middle_index and arr[i] == arr[i - (middle_index - i)]:
            changes = 0
    # Return the changes required
    return changes
```

The algorithm works by iterating through the array, keeping track of odd elements that are not part of a pair by incrementing a counter. At the same time, it checks if an element has a pair later in the array, if so, the counter is reset to zero. The total count is then returned, representing the minimum changes required.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array, making it efficient for most datasets.
