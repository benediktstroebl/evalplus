```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    # Initialize the minimum number of changes to an array length
    # Since we can change an element to any other element,
    # We can make any array palindrome with 'n' changes, where 'n' is the array length.
    min_changes = len(arr)

    # Loop through the array and reduce the min changes if a pair is found
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] != arr[j]:
                min_changes = min(min_changes, (j - i - 1) // 2)

    return min_changes
```

The solution leverages the fact that any array can be transformed into a palindrome using 'n' changes, where 'n' is the length of the array. This approach considers all possible pairings of elements in the array, checking if a pair is not symmetric (not the same when reversed). For every such pairing, we subtract 1 from the minimum changes, halving it as we can change one element to another element to make the pair symmetric, thus increasing the minimum number of changes by 1. The result is the smallest number of changes required to make the array palindromic.
