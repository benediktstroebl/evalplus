    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

        int: The minimum number of changes required 
    """
    # Initialize the result to the length of the array
    result = len(arr)
    # Check if the array is already palindromic
    if arr == sorted(arr)[::-1]:
        return 0
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        # Remove duplicates and reassign result
        if arr[i - 1] == arr[i]:
            result = min(result, arr.count(arr[i]))
        # Check if the element is symmetrical along the array's center
        if i <= len(arr) // 2:
            if arr[i] == arr[len(arr) - 1 - i]:
                result = min(result, 1)
    return result
```

The function `smallest_change` iterates through the array, checking for duplicates and symmetry, then minimizes the result accordingly. This implementation adheres to the problem's requirement to find the minimum number of changes, even if fewer changes would make the array palindic. 

This approach is efficient beyond the minimal complexity O(n), which is unavoidable due to the nature of the problem. The time complexity is O(n), and the space complexity is O(1). 

Note: The returned result indicates the minimum number of changes required; it does not detail the requisite changes themselves, as this would be a recursive solution.
