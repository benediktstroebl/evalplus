This script defines a `prime_fib` function that returns the n-th number that is both a Fibonacci number and a prime number. It uses an internal `is_prime` function for prime-checking. For n=1, it returns 2, which is the first number that is both a prime and a Fibonacci number. If n is greater than 1, it calculates the n-th Fibonacci number and checks if it's prime. If neither the current Fibonacci number nor its predecessor is prime, it returns -1 to indicate that no such number exists.  The `prime_fib` function assumes that n is a positive integer, and in the case of negative or non-integer inputs, it returns -1 to indicate an error or undefined value.  This snippet has comments and corresponding test cases that help understand the logic and verify its correctness.  It is important to note that this function may not cover all prime Fibonacci numbers and might not optimize the prime checking or Fibonacci number calculation, depending on specific requirements and constraints.  If you have specific concerns about the coverage or efficiency of this script, please provide more details so I can adjust it accordingly.
