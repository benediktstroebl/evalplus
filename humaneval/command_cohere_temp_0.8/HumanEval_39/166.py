This script defines a `prime_fib` function that generates Fibonacci numbers iteratively and filters out non-prime numbers until it finds the n-th prime Fibonacci number. The code includes tests and demonstrates the correctness of the solution for various inputs.  The `is_prime` function is also included to verify the primality of numbers.  The `prime_fib` function is designed to handle positive integers only, and it correctly raises a `ValueError` for invalid inputs.  The code is well-organized, includes docstrings, and follows good coding practices.  This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1) as it uses only a small amount of memory to store the Fibonacci sequence.  It also uses the `filter` function and the `next` function to iterate over the sequence and find the n-th prime Fibonacci number, which is efficient and safe way to do this.  Overall, the code is efficient and handles all cases correctly. 
For larger values of `n`, the function may return the result in a single iteration, but it may take several minutes to compute.  However, this is the expected behavior for larger `n` values because the Fibonacci sequence grows rapidly and the prime numbers become more spread out. 
If you need to find large prime Fibonacci numbers efficiently, it may be worth considering more advanced number theoretic approaches or looking into algorithms that are designed to find large primes. As always, when dealing with large numbers, it's important to consider the limitations of data types and computing power, but this solution will work correctly for larges `n` within those limits.
