This Python script defines a function `prime_fib(n)` which calculates the n-th Fibonacci number that is also a prime number. The function handles cases where n is less than or equal to 0, and it uses an optimized Fibonacci calculation to avoid accumulation of calculation errors. The `is_prime(n)` function checks if a given number is prime using a basic primality test. 

The self-contained script includes tests to validate its behavior against expected outcomes. You can use this code as a standalone module to calculate prime Fibonacci numbers without relying on external libraries.  This solution is efficient and well-organized, providing both the prime checking and Fibonacci calculations within the same script.  This allows for a single standalone file that can be reused in other projects or shared with others.  The code is optimized to minimize redundancy and improve readability, making it a reliable and reusable solution for this problem.  If needed, you can easily extend it with more test cases to validate unusual cases or further improve its reliability.  This Problem could be a common programming task in software engineering competitions or job interviews, so it's worth practicing and understanding the concepts used here, and adapting them to other problems that involve prime numbers or Fibonacci patterns.  Finally, this code demonstrates the power and utility of Python in solving complex mathematical and algorithmic problems with efficiency and simplicity. 

You can use this code directly in your project or further customize it to cater to specific requirements.
