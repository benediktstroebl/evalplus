This script defines a `prime_fib` function that implements the following logic:
1. It ensures that the input `n` is a positive integer by computing its absolute value.
2. It uses a rudimentary algorithm to generate the Fibonacci sequence, incrementing a count each time the sequence grows.
3. It concurrently checks each number in the Fibonacci sequence against the `is_prime` function to find a prime number. 

Note that the `is_prime` function is included for completeness, but it's a standard prime-checking function with a moderation for handling integers larger than 1. 

Such an approach provides an understated solution, with a time complexity of `O(Fibonacci[n])` and space complexity of `O(1)`, making it suitable for handling the specified test cases in the blink of an eye.  While concurrent iteration and prime checking are judicious, more complex issues involving prime Fibonacci numbers might require more sophisticated approaches.
