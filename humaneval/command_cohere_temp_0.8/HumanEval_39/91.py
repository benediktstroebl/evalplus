This script defines a `prime_fib` function that implements the described function. The `is_prime` function is used to check if a number is prime. The `prime_fib` function starts by initializing the Fibonacci sequence with the first two elements, then it generates the sequence for `n` steps, and finally, it filters out the prime numbers from the sequence. 

Here are some examples of test cases that can be used to validate the `prime_fib` function:
```python
# Test if the first few Fibonacci primes are returned
assert prime_fib(1) == 2
assert prime_fib(2) == 3
assert prime_fib(3) == 5

# Test with bigger values
assert prime_fib(4) == 13
assert prime_fib(5) == 89

# Test if the function handles input above max int
assert prime_fib(1000) == 199981
``` 
This would ensure that the `prime_fib` function is correctly solved the problem and it works for bigger values too.
