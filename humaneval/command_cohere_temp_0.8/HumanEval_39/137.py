```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def prime_fib(n):
    if n < 1:
        return None
    num = 0
    prev_num = 1
    while num <= n:
        num, prev_num = prev_num, num + prev_num
        if is_prime(num):
            return num
    return None
```

The function `prime_fib` uses an iterative approach to find the nth Fibonacci number that is also a prime number. The `is_prime` function is used to determine if a number is prime. 

To verify the correctness of the solution, you can add test cases as commented lines and run the script. Adjust the `prime_fib` function's `n` parameter according to your needs. 
Line commented out `# >>> prime_fib(1)`, `# >>> prime_fib(2)`, `# >>> prime_fib(3)`, `# >>> prime_fib(4)`, and `# >>> prime_fib(5)`, serve as test cases and demonstrate the expected output of the `prime_fib` function for those particular inputs. 

You can uncomment them and execute the script to see the computed results. 
```python
# >>> prime_fib(1)
2
# >>> prime_fib(2)
3
# >>> prime_fib(3)
5
# >>> prime_fib(4)
13
# >>> prime_fib(5)
89
```
