```

The function prime_fib() calculates the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime. It does so by first checking if n is a positive integer. If so, it initializes `a` and `b` to the first two Fibonacci numbers (2 and 3). Then, it uses `itertools.count()` to generate a sequence of numbers starting from `max(1000, 2 * n)`, with a step size of 2, which roughly ensures that the next Fibonacci number will be prime. Finally, it uses `takewhile()` to stop once it finds the n-th prime Fibonacci number, or it reaches the maximum threshold, `max(1000, 2 * n)`. 

The `is_prime()` function is also included to validate if a number is prime.
