This approach uses a generator expression to iterate through the Fibonacci sequence and checks each number for primality. For the nth number that is both prime and a Fibonacci number, it returns that number, or None if n is invalid.  This means it optimizes the storage while still solving the problem.

This solution passes the unit tests. You can test it by calling `prime_fib(n)` where `n` is a positive integer. 

 
To better understand the solution a breakdown of the code is explained below: 

1. The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime. It returns True if the number is greater than 1 and there is no divisor from 2 to the square root of the number. 
2. The `prime_fib` function returns the n-th number that is both prime and a Fibonacci number. In the initial phase, the function returns the first two Fibonacci numbers that are prime. It utilizes a counter to tally the number of calls, and afterward increments the counter by 2 to account for the subsequent two numbers. By doing this, it can determine the following prime Fibonacci numbers and deliver the correct figure when n is requested. 

This solution has a time complexity of `O(sqrt(n))` as it iterates to the square root of n to check for divisors. 

The space complexity is `O(1)` as it only stores the last two prime Fibonacci numbers. It has a space complexity of O(1) since it only stores the two latest prime Fibonacci numbers.
