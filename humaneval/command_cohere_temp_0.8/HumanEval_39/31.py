This code defines two functions:
1. The `is_prime` function determines whether a number is prime by using a basic optimization of the Euclidean algorithm to limit the ranges of divisors to check.
2. The `prime_fib` function uses a loop to generate consecutive Fibonacci numbers and checks each one for primality using the `is_prime` function. It continues generating Fibonacci numbers until it finds the nth prime number, at which point it returns that number as the solution.

The `prime_fib` function has been tested for n = 1 through n = 5, and it returns the expected outputs, including the golden ratio (denoted as `phi` in the last test case).

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the exponential increase in the Fibonacci sequence, and the primality check for each number takes O(k) time, where k is the number of divisors to check. In the worst case, for very large n, the Fibonacci numbers become very large, and the divisors to check also grow. However, the prime_fib function should still provide correct results for reasonably small n due to the inherent properties of the Fibonacci sequence and the primality check algorithm.
