The `is_prime` function is used to check if a number is prime. The `prime_fib` function uses a similar approach to the example provided earlier, generating the Fibonacci sequence iteratively and checking each number for primality until it finds the n-th prime Fibonacci number.

To better understand the behavior of the code, you can uncomment the print statements to see the values of `x` and `n` at each step of the calculation. 

Please note that while the theoretical limit of the `prime_fib` function is unknown, the function is designed to handle reasonably large values of `n` effectively.  In practice, the function's performance may begin to slow down as the size of the Fibonacci number increases, but it is capable of handling most practical scenarios.  If you have a specific large value of `n` in mind, feel free to test it out using the code above!
