This script defines a `prime_fib` function that generates Fibonacci numbers recursively and checks each number to see if it is prime. It returns the `n-th` number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the requested number as its output. It also includes type hints and a docstring to describe the function's purpose and parameters.

Also, the `is_prime` function is added to check if a number is prime or not. This function is used by `prime_fib` to generate the Fibonacci numbers and check if each one is prime. 

You can use the function by calling `prime_fib(n)` where `n` is the position of the desired number in the Fibonacci sequence. 

For example:
```python
>>> prime_fib(1)
2
>>> prime_fib(2)
3
>>> prime_fib(3)
5
>>> prime_fib(4)
13
>>> prime_fib(5)
89
``` 
The script is also tested and it passes as expected.
