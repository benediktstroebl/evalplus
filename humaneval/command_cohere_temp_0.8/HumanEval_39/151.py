Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def is_prime(n):
    """
    Checks if a number is prime
    """
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def prime_fib(n):
    """
    Returns the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime.
    """
    if n < 1:
        raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer.")
    elif n == 1:
        return 2
    elif n == 2:
        return 3
    
    prev_fib, curr_fib = 0, 1
    for _ in range(3, n + 1):
        next_fib = prev_fib + curr_fib
        if is_prime(next_fib):
            return next_fib
        prev_fib, curr_fib = curr_fib, next_fib
    
    # Shouldn't reach this line if the function is correct
    return None

# Tests
assert prime_fib(1) == 2
assert prime_fib(2) == 3
assert prime_fib(3) == 5
assert prime_fib(4) == 13
assert prime_fib(5) == 89
```
This code defines two functions: 
1. The `is_prime` function checks whether a given number is prime or not. 
2. The `prime_fib` function, which first checks if `n` is less than 3, returns 2 if `n` is 1, and returns 3 if `n` is 2, based on the problem statement. For n >= 3, it iterates through the Fibonacci numbers, checking each one for primality, and returns the first prime Fibonacci number encountered when `n` is reached. 

The code also includes test cases to verify the function. You can use the `prime_fib` function by passing a positive integer as an argument to retrieve the desired prime Fibonacci numbers. 
You can run the below test cases to check against the expected values: 
```python
assert prime_fib(1) == 2
assert prime_fib(2) == 3
assert prime_fib(3) == 5
assert prime_fib(4) == 13
assert prime_fib(5) == 89
```
