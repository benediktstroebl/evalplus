This script defines a `prime_fib` function, which calculates the n-th Fibonacci number that is also a prime number. It starts with an iterative implementation of the Fibonacci sequence, checks for potential divisors up to the square root of the target number, and appends the result to a list for further exploration. The script includes a `is_prime` function to validate primality and a series of tests to ensure the correctness of the `prime_fib` function. 

The code also incorporates type hints and docstrings, adding clarity and readability to the codebase, and includes a `__starting_point` function to execute the tests. When run, this function serves as a validation suite for the `prime_fib` function, checking if its output for specific inputs matches the expected values.
