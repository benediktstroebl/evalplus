The function `prime_fib` in this code takes an integer `n` as input and generates the `nth` Fibonacci prime number. It does this by first establishing the Fibonacci sequence up to 300 (adjustable via the `md` variable), then checking each number for primality starting from the 300th term. The sequence is divided at each prime number it encounters, and the index of the prime number in the future indicates where the sequence should be cut to provide the `n`th Fibonacci number. This approach saves having to generate the full Fibonacci sequence in advance while still providing reasonably efficient access to any particular Fibonacci number. 

The `is_prime` function is also included in the code to help determine whether a given number is prime or not. 

This approach provides a reasonable balance between memory efficiency and computational efficiency for this specific problem.
