Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def is_prime(n):
    """
    Checks if a number is prime
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def prime_fib(n):
    """
    Returns the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return None
    elif n == 1:
        return 2
    elif n == 2:
        return 3
    
    # Initialize variables for the first and second Fibonacci numbers
    a, b = 0, 1
    
    # Iterate through the Fibonacci sequence to find the n-th prime number
    for i in range(n - 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
        
        # Check if the current number is prime
        if is_prime(a):
            return a
    
    return None

# Tests
assert prime_fib(1) == 2
assert prime_fib(2) == 3
assert prime_fib(3) == 5
assert prime_fib(4) == 13
assert prime_fib(5) == 89
```
This code defines a `prime_fib` function that generates the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime. It does this by iteratively calculating the Fibonacci sequence and checking each number for primality using the `is_prime` function. The code includes tests to validate its behavior. You can add these tests to a separate file called `test_prime_fib.py` and run them using the `pytest` library to verify the function's correctness.  The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime or not by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility. If the number is divisible by any integer within this range it returns `False`, if not it returns `True`.  This function can be used to efficiently determine if an integer is prime.  Overall, this code showcases a practical application of Python in solving mathematical problems combining prime number and Fibonacci number generation. 

You can adjust these test cases based on specific requirements or add more tests to cover a broader range of input scenarios.
