Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def is_prime(n):
    """
    Checks if a number is prime
    """
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def prime_fib(n):
    """
    Returns the n-th number that is both prime and a Fibonacci number.
    """
    if n < 1:
        raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer.")
    elif n == 1:
        return 2
    elif n == 2:
        return 3
    
    prev_fib, curr_fib = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n - 2):
        next_fib = prev_fib + curr_fib
        prev_fib, curr_fib = curr_fib, next_fib
    
    # Handle the case where n is exceptionally large and we've reached the end of the Fibonacci sequence
    if n > 89:
        return prev_fib + curr_fib
    
    # Search for the desired number among the Fibonacci sequence
    while True:
        # Check if the next Fibonacci number is prime
        next_fib = prev_fib + curr_fib
        if is_prime(next_fib):
            return next_fib
        
        # If it's not prime, move to the next number in the sequence
        prev_fib, curr_fib = curr_fib, next_fib

# Tests
assert prime_fib(1) == 2
assert prime_fib(2) == 3
assert prime_fib(3) == 5
assert prime_fib(4) == 13
assert prime_fib(5) == 89
```
This code defines a `prime_fib` function that calculates the n-th number that is both a prime number and a Fibonacci number. It uses an optimized Fibonacci sequence calculation and a simple prime checking function to achieve this result. The `prime_fib` function handles cases where n is less than or equal to 2 directly, and when n is greater than 2, it generates the Fibonacci sequence until it finds the desired n-th prime number Fibonacci. The code includes tests to validate its behavior against known test cases.
