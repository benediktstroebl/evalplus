This script defines two functions:
- The `is_prime` function checks whether a given number is prime.
- The `prime_fib` function returns the n-th Fibonacci number that is also a prime number. The function initially handles the special cases `n < 1` and `n == 1` or `n == 2` using returns statements. For `n > 2`, the function uses a deque to generate Fibonacci numbers and checks each number with the `is_prime` function. The function returns the n-th Fibonacci number that is prime. 

This solution corresponds to the test cases mentioned in the original prompt and will return the expected values for any other positive integer input for `n`. 
To get the next prime Fibonacci number for `n > 2`, the algorithm uses a deque (double-ended queue) to generate Fibonacci numbers. It is a more efficient approach rather than using recursive functions which may lead to stack overflow for larger values of `n`. 
The `is_prime` function is used to check if a number is prime, and it does this by iterating through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility. 

You can add tests cases to the script to cover more values for `n` to ensure the function `prime_fib` behaves as expected. 
If the prompt indicates that there is a specific test framework in place, consider adding the appropriate test cases following that framework to cover more scenarios. In this case, the code includes docstrings for the `is_prime` and `prime_fib` functions, which clarify the purpose of each function and its input parameter. These docstrings were not provided in the original request but are helpful to include for documentation purposes.  Additionally, the `prime_fib` function includes comments that track the progress of the algorithm, which are also useful for understanding the underlying logic.  If there is a specific test framework in place, consider adding test cases following that framework to cover a variety of inputs for n, including edge cases.  This will ensure the correctness of the function in prime_fib.  Any other improvements to the original request will be appreciated.
