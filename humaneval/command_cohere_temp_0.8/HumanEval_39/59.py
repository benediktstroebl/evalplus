Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def is_prime(n):
    """
    Checks if a number is prime
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def prime_fib(n):
    """
    Returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return None
    elif n == 1:
        return 2
    elif n == 2:
        return 3
    else:
        # First Fibonacci number that is prime is 5
        fib = 5
        # Next few Fibonacci numbers are prime
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            if is_prime(fib):
                fib = fib * 2 + fib
                if is_prime(fib):
                    return fib
            else:
                return None
        # If we reach here, then the required number is prime and a Fibonacci number
        return fib

# Tests
assert prime_fib(1) == 2
assert prime_fib(2) == 3
assert prime_fib(3) == 5
assert prime_fib(4) == 13
assert prime_fib(5) == 89
```

This code defines two functions:
1. The `is_prime` function checks whether a given number is prime or not using the trial division method optimized for efficiency.
2. The `prime_fib` function calculates the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime. The solution uses the fact that consecutive primes relatively often occur in the Fibonacci sequence. The algorithm iterates through the Fibonacci sequence, checking each number for primality with the `is_prime` function. If a prime is found, it is returned; if none are found for the required number of iterations, the loop exits, and the function returns the last prime Fibonacci number tried.
