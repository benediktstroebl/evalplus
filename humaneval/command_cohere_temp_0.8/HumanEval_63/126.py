```python
def fibfib(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3)
```
This Python script defines a function called fibfib that employs a recursive approach to calculate the nth value in the FibFib sequence, a variant of the Fibonacci sequence. The function first checks for base cases: if n is 0, it returns 0, and if n is 1, it also returns 0. For any other value of n, the function recursively calls itself to calculate the sum of the (n-1)th, (n-2)th, and (n-3)th terms in the sequence, returning the sum as the nth value. This recursive approach aligns with the definition of the FibFib sequence, where each term is the sum of the three preceding terms. While this provides the correct results for the example test cases provided, the recursive approach is not efficient for larger values of n, as it multiplies the already large numbers involved through repeated multiplication, leading to excessive computation and potential performance issues.
