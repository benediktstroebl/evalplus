This code defines a generator function `fibfib_gen` that generates FibFib numbers recursively. It takes an integer `n` as input and yields the FibFib numbers up to the n-th index. It follows the definition of the FibFib sequence: `fibfib(0) == 0`, `fibfib(1) == 0`, `fibfib(2) == 1`, and for `n > 2`, `fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3)`. 

The function `fibfib` is a generator expression that uses the `next` function to return the n-th FibFib number generated by the `fibfib_gen` function.

This code efficiently computes the n-th element of the FibFib number sequence and ensures you avoid overflow for large inputs. 

Note that the `fibfib` function calls `next(fibfib_gen(n))`, which retrieves the n-th element generated by `fibfib_gen`. This is in line with the problem statement, as it asks for the efficient computation of the n-th FibFib number, not the entire sequence. 
If you intended to retrieve the entire sequence up to index `n`, you should use `list(fibfib_gen(n))` instead of `fibfib_gen(n)`.  Please confirm if this solution matches your requirements, and let me know if you have any further questions or additional details.
