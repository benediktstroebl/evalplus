```python
from collections import Sequence

class FibFib(Sequence):
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n
        self.seq = [0, 0, 1]
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            self.seq.append(self.seq[i - 1] + self.seq[i - 2] + self.seq[i - 3])

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        if index < self.n:
            return self.seq[index]
        else:
            # this is mostly to prevent indices from blowing up and crashing the function
            return None

# some tests
print(FibFib(1)[1])
print(FibFib(5)[5])
print(FibFib(8)[8])
```

This code defines a class `FibFib` that implements the sequence protocol from the `collections` module. This means it can be indexed like a list to retrieve items. The `__init__` method takes an integer `n` as input and computes the first 3 elements of the sequence using the definition of the FibFib sequence. It then iterates to compute the next elements of the sequence. The `__getitem__` method retrieves the element at index `index`. The code also includes some simple tests for the class. 

One thing to note is that the `__getitem__` method returns `None` for indices greater than `n` instead of raising an `IndexError`. This is done to prevent the function from crashing and potentially leaking resources if somebody accidentally passes an extremely large index. Nevertheless, the user will see `None` instead of the output they may be expecting if they are indexing beyond the length of the sequence. 

Please let me know if you would like me to make any adjustments or additions to the code.
