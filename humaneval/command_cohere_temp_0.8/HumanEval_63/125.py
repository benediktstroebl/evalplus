This code defines the `fibfib` function and a helper function `fibfib_helper` that efficiently computes the n-th FibFib number using a variation of the doubling method. The doubling method is a form of dynamic programming that reduces the computation of FibFib numbers to a recursive formula, allowing for more efficient computation than plain recursion or explicit iteration would provide. The test cases provided in the original prompt are also included, and they ensure that the function `fibfib` behaves as expected.
