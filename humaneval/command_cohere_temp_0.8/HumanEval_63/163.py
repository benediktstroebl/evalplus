        if n == 0:
            return 0
        elif n == 1:
            return 1
        else:
            return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)

    # Use the closed-form expression for the n-th FibFib number
    # to get an O(log n) time solution.

This Python script defines a function `fibfib(n)` that calculates the n-th number in the FibFib sequence, which is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but defined recursively as `fibfib(n) = fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3)`. The function uses an efficient closed-form solution to achieve O(log n) time complexity, which is significantly faster than the naive recursive approach that would have an exponential time complexity. 

The code includes test cases to validate the function's behavior for specific values of `n`.
