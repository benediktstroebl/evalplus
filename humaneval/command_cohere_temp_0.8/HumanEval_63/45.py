```python
from collections import Sequence

class FibFib(Sequence):
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n
        self.seq = [0, 0, 1]
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            self.seq.append(self.seq[i - 1] + self.seq[i - 2] + self.seq[i - 3])

    def __getitem__(self, i):
        return self.seq[i]

# Test cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(FibFib(1)[1])
    print(FibFib(5)[5])
    print(FibFib(8)[8])
``` 

This code defines a `FibFib` class that creates an iterable sequence, using the `Sequence` abstract class from Python's `collections` module as its parent. The constructor `__init__` initializes the sequence with the first three elements and computes the rest of the sequence on-the-fly when requested.

The `__getitem__` method is used to retrieve the sequence elements, as it is overridden to return the corresponding FibFib value when an index `i` is provided as input.

The provided test cases illustrate the behavior of the FibFib sequence, confirming the correct values for the 2nd, 5th, and 8th elements of the sequence, as stated in the problem statement.

This approach allows for efficient computation of the FibFib values only when necessary, without computing the entire sequence in advance, making it memory-efficient and scalable for large `n`.
