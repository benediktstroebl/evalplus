```python
from itertools import accumulate

def fibfib_iter(n: int):
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("FibFib is defined only for non-negative integers.")
    fib = [0, 0, 1]
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        fib.append(fib[i-1] + fib[i-2] + fib[i-3])
    return accumulate(fib)[-1]

# Unit tests:
print(fibfib_iter(1))
# Should print: 0

print(fibfib_iter(5))
# Should print: 4

print(fibfib_iter(8))
# Should print: 24

# This should trigger a ValueError since the FibFib sequence is undefined for negative integers:
print(fibfib_iter(-3))
```

The function `fibfib_iter` uses an iterator to generate the FibFib values one by one, avoiding the need to store the entire sequence in memory (which would be necessary if we used a list to store the sequence). It also includes a unit test to validate the function. 

One thing to keep in mind when using this method is that it requires a large amount of memory when handling large `n`. This is because the function needs to keep all previously computed FibFib numbers in memory via the `accumulate` function, which creates a list of all intermediate FibFib values. So, while this approach is memory-efficient compared to the naive approach of using a list to store the entire sequence, it may still not be suitable for very large `n`. However, for most practical purposes, this method should work well, as the FibFib sequence grows slowly compared to the Fibonacci sequence.
