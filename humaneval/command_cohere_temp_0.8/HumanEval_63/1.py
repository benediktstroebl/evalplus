This script defines the `fibfib` function, which is an optimized iterative approach to calculate the nth value of the FibFib sequence based on the provided recursive formula. The function also includes type hints, providing better clarity and enabling type checking, and it incorporates a docstring for explanatory purposes.

The test cases are designed to validate the function's behavior against the expected outputs for various inputs. Adjust these values as needed to test different points in the sequence.
