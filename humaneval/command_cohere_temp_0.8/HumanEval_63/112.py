This Python script defines a function called `fibfib` that efficiently calculates the n-th element of a numerical sequence that has similarities to the Fibonacci sequence. The script includes documentation in the form of a docstring, which explains the purpose of the function, and provides example usage that illustrates how the function is intended to be called and the expected output. The function implements an iterative algorithm for calculating the sequence by leveraging recursive definitions. It starts with 0th and 1st elements being 0 and the 2nd element being 1, and then, it recursively calculates subsequent elements based on the preceding three elements (like the Fibonacci sequence). The function utilizes Python's type hinting to ensure that it is passed an integer for the `n` parameter. Additionally, the function includes error handling to cover edge cases, correctly handling inputs of 0, 1, and 2, and raising an exception for invalid inputs.
