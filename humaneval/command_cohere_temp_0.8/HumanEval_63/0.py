```python
def fibfib(n):
    prev3, prev2, prev1, curr = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for _ in range(n):
        curr = prev3 + prev2 + prev1
        prev3 = prev2
        prev2 = prev1
        prev1 = curr
    return curr
```
This script defines a function `fibfib(n)` that calculates the nth number in the FibFib sequence, as described in the prompt. It uses a loop to iteratively calculate the sequence elements, storing the previous three values in variables to avoid recomputation. This algorithm is efficient because it avoids redundant calculations by reusing computed values, making it a closed-form solution for the FibFib sequence. This approach significantly improves efficiency compared to manually recalculating each element, making it scalable and suitable for large inputs. The self-contained nature of the function makes it easy to use and understand, providing a straightforward solution to the problem.
