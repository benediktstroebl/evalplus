This Python script defines a function called `fibfib` that calculates the n-th number in the FibFib sequence, which is a variation of the Fibonacci sequence. The script includes a docstring that explains the sequence's definition and the input/output examples from the problem statement. The function uses three base cases (n = 0, n = 1, n = 2) to optimize the computation and reduce the need for recursive calls. 

This solution is efficient because it doesn't recalculate previously computed values and uses a consistent number of operations per loop iteration.
