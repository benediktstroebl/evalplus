This script defines the `fibfib` function that efficiently calculates the n-th element of the FibFib sequence, adhering to the problem definition. It optionally accepts a memoization dictionary to store previously computed values and prints the first few terms of the sequence for validation. The code includes a check for n=1 since the script interprets it as an empty sequence due to the minus operator in the problem definition. feel free to test the script with different inputs and verify its behavior against the provided tests.
