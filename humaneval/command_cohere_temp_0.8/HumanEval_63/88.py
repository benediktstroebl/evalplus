```python
def fibfib(n):
    # Create an array to store fibfib values for future computations
    fibfib_array = [0, 0, 1]
    if n >= len(fibfib_array):
        for _ in range(n-len(fibfib_array) + 1):
            fibfib_array.append(fibfib_array[-1] + fibfib_array[-2] + fibfib_array[-3])
    return fibfib_array[n]
```

This Python script defines the `fibfib` function, which returns the n-th element of the FibFib sequence. It initializes an array `fibfib_array` with the first three elements of the sequence. For larger n, it iteratively computes subsequent elements and appends them to the array. This approach efficiently calculates the FibFib value for any `n` via dynamic programming. 

The script passes the given tests since it correctly calculates the FibFib values as expected. 
```python
>>> fibfib(1)
0
>>> fibfib(5)
4
>>> fibfib(8)
24
```
The code's efficiency makes it well-suited for handling practical applications that involve FibFib numbers. Do you need assistance with any further optimizations or complex scenarios? Feel free to ask, and I'll gladly help you enhance this solution further.
