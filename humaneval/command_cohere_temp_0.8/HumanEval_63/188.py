```

This code defines an iterator-based approach to generating the FibFib sequence, which is more efficient than the straightforward recursive approach. This function also passes the provided tests. The code also includes a check to ensure that the input is a non-negative integer, raising a ValueError if necessary. Finally, the code demonstrates how to use the function and handles the iteration correctly, raising a StopIteration once the end of the iterator is reached.
