```python
from typing import List

def fibfib_naive(n: int, memo: List[int] = None) -> int:
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("FibFib is only defined for non-negative integers")
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    if memo is None:
        memo = [0, 0]
    if n <= len(memo):
        return memo[n]
    memo_len = len(memo)
    fibfib_rec = lambda m: fibfib_naive(m, memo)[0] + fibfib_rec(m - 1) + fibfib_rec(m - 2)
    memo[memo_len] = fibfib_rec(n)
    return memo[n]

# These tests will fail for the incorrect implementation
assert fibfib_naive(1) == 0
assert fibfib_naive(5) == 4
assert fibfib_naive(8) == 24

```
This code provides a top-down implementation of the FibFib sequence, also known as the Fibonacci sequence, but with the added element of caching previous values to avoid recalculating them, making the function more efficient. Note that this solution can still be optimized further using bottom-up dynamic programming to further reduce computation time.
