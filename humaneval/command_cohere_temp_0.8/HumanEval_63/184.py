This script defines a function `fibfib(n)` that efficiently computes the n-th element of the FibFib sequence in `O(log(n))` time. It achieves this by cleverly using the mathematical definition of the sequence to re-define it in terms of a simpler recursive sequence. The helper function `fibfib_helper()` performs the recursive computation. This redesigned sequence allows the n-th term to be computed with fewer calculations as it proceeds, making it more efficient. The absolute efficiency gain depends on the specific sequence of numbers asked for, but it's generally more efficient for large n. 

The definition of the FibFib sequence is that `fibfib(0) == 0, fibfib(1) == 0, and fibfib(2) == 1, and fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3) for n > 2.` The provided example tests demonstrate that the function correctly calculates the FibFib numbers for different values of n.  This efficiently computed sequence can be useful in various mathematical and algorithmic applications, and it showcases the advantage of approaching dynamic programming problems with a smart rewriting of the sequence definition.  It also demonstrates the power of mathematical reasoning in optimizing computational problems.
