```python
def change_base(x, base):
    return str(x) in ['0', '1'] and str(x) * int(math.log(x, base)) or str(int(x, base))
```

This function takes two inputs, `x`, and `base`. Using the prompt logic, it first checks if `x` is either `0` or `1`. In this case, it returns the result of `str(x) * int(math.log(x, base))`, which correctly converts the number to the new base. Otherwise, it converts the number to the new base by taking the integer conversion of `x` with base `base` and converts it into a string to return the result.

Here is a test suite that can be used to validate the function:
```python
def test_change_base():
    assert change_base(8, 3) == '22'
    assert change_base(8, 2) == '1000'
    assert change_base(7, 2) == '111'
    assert change_base(2, 2) == '10'
    assert change_base(10, 2) == '101010'
    assert change_base(5, 5) == '101'
    assert change_base(3, 3) == '21'
    assert change_base(0, 10) == '0'
    assert change_base(1, 2) == '1'
```

This test suite contains a variety of tests covering edge cases and different scenarios to ensure that the `change_base` function works correctly. You can use these tests to validate the function and ensure that it behaves as expected.  Assuming the function is stored in a variable called `custom_change_base`, you can use it in the following way:
```python
def test_change_base():
    assert custom_change_base(8, 3) == '22'
    assert custom_change_base(8, 2) == '1000'
    assert custom_change_base(7, 2) == '111'
    assert custom_change_base(2, 2) == '10'
    assert custom_change_base(10, 2) == '101010'
    assert custom_change_base(5, 5) == '101'
    assert custom_change_base(3, 3) == '21'
    assert custom_change_base(0, 10) == '0'
    assert custom_change_base(1, 2) == '1'
``` 
This way, you can reuse the tests to verify the correctness of the function with different implementations in the future.  If the function has multiple inputs, you may want to consider adding tests that validate each input parameter separately to ensure they behave as expected.  This can help catch potential bugs early on and ensure that the function remains stable even after modifications or updates.  Feel free to adapt this test suite to your needs, and let me know if this solution adequately solves the problem or if you need help with anything else!
