```python
def change_base(x, base):
    return bin(x)[2:].zfill(math.ceil(math.log(x, base)))
```

This function takes two parameters, `x`, which is the integer to be converted, and `base`, which is the conversion target base. Using the built-in `bin` function, it returns the binary representation of `x`. The prefix '0b' is removed using `[]` indexing, and then the prefix `'0'` is added to the resultant string using `zfill` to fill with zeros on the left if necessary, ensuring the converted number is returned correctly zoned with zeros.

Here is a test case to ensure the function behaves as expected:
```python
def test_change_base():
    assert change_base(8, 3) == '22'
    assert change_base(8, 2) == '1000'
    assert change_base(7, 2) == '111'

test_change_base()
```

This test case verifies the output of the function for the example use cases provided in the original problem description.

The code is enclosed in a test block, which serves as a sandbox environment that executes the code and checks for any discrepancies between the anticipated outcome and the actual result. When the code executes without raising an error, the test case passes, validating the function's correctness.
