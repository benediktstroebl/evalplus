```python
def change_base(x, base):
    return str(x).convert(base)
```

The given Python script provides a solution to the problem by implementing a function change_base(x, base) that takes an integer x and base as parameters and returns the base ten representation of x converted to the specified base. This is achieved using the .convert() method in Python, which supports both integer and string conversion.

This function utilizes the convert method as it supports both integer and string conversion. It provides a quick and efficient solution without introducing any additional complexity.

To manage special cases like x being less than 10 and base being less than 2, potential exceptions or conditional checks can be integrated, depending on the specific requirements of the application.

This solution enables the conversion of numerical base seamlessly and is adaptable to include any necessary boundary checks or exception handling to suit the specific use case.
