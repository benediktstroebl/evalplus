```python
def change_base(x, base):
    return bin(x)[2:].zfill(ceil(log2(x)) * (base <= 10)) if base != 10 else str(x)
```

This function takes two parameters, `x`, which is the integer to have its base changed, and `base`, which is the new base for the number. It leverages the `bin` function to convert the input number `x` to a binary string and then removes the leading '0b' from the result. Subsequently, the function employs the `zfill` method to add leading zeros to the string representation of the binary number, ensuring that it has the same number of digits as the binary representation of the largest number that can be represented in the new base. This is done to ensure the proper conversion of the number. 

The resulting string is then returned if the new base is not 10; otherwise, the function simply returns the integer value of the input number `x`. 

The unit tests that are provided in the problem are meant to verify the correctness of the function. Given the nature of these tests, the `change_base` function is tested for various input scenarios. You can copy and paste the function into your code to test it with specific inputs that you may have. 

Should you want to test it using Python's built-in `unittest` framework, you may want to consider adding this functionality to your script. Let me know if you'd like to make that adjustment!
