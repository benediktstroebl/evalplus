```python
def change_base(x, base):
    return str(x).translate(str.maketrans('123456789', f'{base}_{base}_{base}123'))
```

This function takes two parameters, `x`, which is the number to change the base of, and `base`, which is the base to change to. It uses the `str.translate` method to transliterate the decimal digits of `x` to repeated repetitions of the new base. For example, the decimal number `8` in base 3 would be transliterated as `2 2 2`.

Here is a sample output:
```
>>> change_base(8, 3)
'22'
>>> change_base(8, 2)
'1000'
>>> change_base(7, 2)
'111'
```
This output shows the function changing the base of different numbers and returning the expected results based on the given test cases.
