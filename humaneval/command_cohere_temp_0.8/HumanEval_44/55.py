```python
def change_base(x, base):
    return bin(x)[2:].zfill(ceil(log2(x)) // log2(base))
```

This function takes an integer `x` and an integer `base` as parameters. It converts the integer `x` to a base `base` representation and returns that representation as a string. The use of `bin` helps convert numbers to a binary base-2 representation, and the `[2:]` slice isolates just the binary representation without leading '0b'. `ceil` and `log2` are used to determine the minimum number of base `base` digits needed to represent x. The `zfill` method ensures the result has that many digits by padding with zeros if necessary.

Here's an example usage:
```python
print(change_base(8, 3))  # output: '22'
print(change_base(8, 2))  # output: '1000'
print(change_base(7, 2))  # output: '111'
```
