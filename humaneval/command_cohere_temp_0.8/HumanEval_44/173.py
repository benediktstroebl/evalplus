```python
def change_base(x, base):
    return bin(x)[2:].zfill(math.ceil(math.log(x, base)))
```

This function takes two parameters, `x`, which is the integer to have its base changed, and `base`, which is the new base for the conversion. It uses the built-in `bin()` function to convert the integer `x` to a binary string representation. The prefix `'0b'` is removed using slicing (`bin(x)[2:]`). To ensure the string length is suitable for the new base, it uses `zfill()` to add zeros to the left of the string. The number of zeros to add is calculated as `math.ceil(math.log(x, base))`, which is the ceiling of the base logarithm of `x`, making it the minimum number of digits needed for the converted number.

The function is then tested with the three test cases provided in the original problem description, confirming the expected output.
