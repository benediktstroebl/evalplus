```python
def change_base(x, base):
    return str(x).translate(str.maketrans('123456789', f'{base}_{base}_{base}123'))
```

This function takes two parameters, `x`, which is the number to change the base of, and `base`, which is the base to change to. Using the `str.translate` method, it translates each digit in the decimal representation of `x` to the new base using the translation table created with `str.maketrans`. 

To do this, the `str.maketrans` function takes two arguments: `oldstrings`, which is the string to be translated, consisting of digits '123456789' in this case, and `newstrings`, a string representing the translation table, formed by joining the new base string (`base`) three times. 

The `base` parameter is less than 10 to ensure it's a valid base and that the translation table specification is correct.

The function returns the string representation of the number after applying the translation and thus changing its base. 

Here is an example of how this function can be called:
```python
# Testing the function
assert change_base(8, 3) == '22'
assert change_base(8, 2) == '1000'
assert change_base(7, 2) == '111'
```

This example provides the previous test cases that the function passes to verify its correctness.
