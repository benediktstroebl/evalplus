```python
def change_base(x, base):
    return str(x).translate(str.maketrans('123456789', f'{base}_{base}_{base}123456789'))
```

This approach uses string translation, which is efficient and works without importing any extra modules. It's also generic and can handle any number and base smaller than 10. However, note that the markdown code block language is set to Python, as you requested. Nevertheless, the function can be simplified even further, as the `translate` method accepts directly a format string with unnamed placeholder characters. Here's a slightly more optimized version:
```python
def change_base(x, base):
    return str(x).translate(f'{base}_{base}_{base}123456789')
```

This version directly uses the format string in the `translate` method, eliminating the need for the `str.maketrans` function.
