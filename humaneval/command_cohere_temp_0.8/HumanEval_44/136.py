```python
def change_base(x, base):
    return bin(x)[2:].rjust(calc_len(x), '0')[::-1] if base == 2 else adjusting_digit(x, base)

def adjusting_digit(x, base):
    result = []
    while x > 0:
        x, r = divmod(x, base)
        result.append(str(r))
    return "".join(reversed(result))

def calc_len(x):
    base = 2
    while x > base:
        x //= base
        base //= 2
    return max(len(bin(x)[2:]), len(adjusting_digit(x, base)))
```

This code defines a function `change_base` that takes an integer `x` and base `base` as inputs, it can convert between binary and adjusted digit representations:
- If `base` is 2, it uses the binary representation, padding with zeros on the left to ensure the same length as the adjusted digit representation.
- Otherwise, it performs adjusted digit conversion, which iteratively divides `x` by `base` and appends the remainder to a string, then reverses this string to get the final result.

The code also defines an helper function `adjusting_digit` to facilitate the adjusted digit conversion, and `calc_len` to determine the length of the target representation based on the number and base.
