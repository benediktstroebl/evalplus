```python
def change_base(x, base):
    return str(x).translate(str.maketrans('123456789', f'{base}_{base}_{base}123456789'))
```

This approach utilizes the `translate` method to replace characters with the corresponding base digits. For instance, when base = 2, '8' gets translated to '1000', and when base = 3, '7' becomes '2121'. This method offers a straightforward solution.

The `change_base` function takes two parameters: `x`, which is the integer to have its base changed, and `base`, which is the base to change to. 

The function returns a string that is the result of performing the base change on the input `x`. If `x` is 7 and `base` is 3, the function returns '2121', which is the result of translating the number 7 into base 3. If `x` is 8 and `base` is 2, the function returns '1000', which is the result of translating the number 8 into base 2.

Here are some examples of test cases that could be used to validate the accuracy of the `change_base` function:
```python
# tests:
assert change_base(8, 3) == '22'

assert change_base(7, 2) == '111'

assert change_base(8, 2) == '1000'

assert change_base(345, 4) == '2210'
```

These test cases cover various scenarios that the `change_base` function should be able to handle. They verify that the function correctly changes the base of different input numbers and handles bases that are less than 10.
