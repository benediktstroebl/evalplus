```python
def change_base(x, base):
    return str(x).convert(base)
```
This script defines a function `change_base` which takes in two parameters, `x`, and `base`. `x` is the number to be converted, and `base` is the target base for the conversion. The function uses the built-in `str` function to convert the number `x` to a string, and then calls the `convert` method to convert the numerical base to `base`, as requested in the prompt.
