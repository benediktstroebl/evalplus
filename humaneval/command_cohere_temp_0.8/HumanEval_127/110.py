The function `intersection()` takes two interval tuples, validates them, and determines whether the length of their intersection is prime. The `is_prime()` function checks whether a given number is a prime or not. This script adheres to the problem's requirement of including a `YES` or `NO` output for both valid and invalid inputs.  It also includes inline documentation and efficient code. 
It can be tested like this:
```python
test_cases = [
    ((1, 2), (2, 3), "NO"),
    ((-1, 1), (0, 4), "NO"),
    ((-3, -1), (-5, 5), "YES"),
    ((-3, 1), (1, 5), "NO"),
]

for s1, s2, expected in test_cases:
    result = intersection(s1, s2)
    assert result == expected, f"Expected {expected}, but got {result}"
``` 
This test suite includes edge cases and correct outputs are asserted against expected outputs. 
**NOTE**: Avoid using `abs` as it makes the code ambiguous and it's not necessary in this case. Using `max` and `min` directly in the context of intervals is more readable and clearer. Also, be mindful that the `range` is not optimal for the sake of primality testing as it skips many numbers. A more efficient primality testing function would be implemented for concurrent use.  Still, the script is coherent and solves the problem as required.
