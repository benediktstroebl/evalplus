The approach uses a simple primality test courtesy of the `is_prime` function. The function is_prime checks whether a given number is prime or not. It does this by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility. If the number is divisible by any integer within this range it is not prime, otherwise, it is prime. 

The function intersection takes two interval endpoints (s1 and s2) and calculates the length of the intersection between these intervals. It does this by finding the minimum endpoint of both intervals to determine the length of the intersection. After this, it checks whether this length is prime using the previously mentioned primality test. If the length is not prime or if the intervals do not intersect, it returns "NO", otherwise, it returns "YES". 

To test the script, you can run it in your local machine providing your own input samples to verify the correctness of the approach like this:
```python
# Testing the function
print(intersection((1, 2), (2, 3))) # Output: NO
print(intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4))) # Output: NO
print(intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5))) # Output: YES
```

This will confirm the expected output for the given input samples.  This will ensure the correctness of the approach.  You can also modify and add more samples to this testing code to validate the function further.
