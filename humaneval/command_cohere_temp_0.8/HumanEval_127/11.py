```

The function `intersection()` takes in two interval pairs and returns "YES" if the length of the intersection is prime, or "NO" otherwise. It also returns "NO" if the intervals do not overlap. This is achieved by first calculating the intersection interval using integer arithmetic and then converting the resulting interval to a tuple. The tuple is then passed to the previously defined `is_prime()` function to determine if the length of the intersection is a prime number or not.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)))  # Expected output: "NO"
print(intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)))  # Expected output: "NO"
print(intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)))  # Expected output: "YES"
```

This script passes all the test cases provided in the original prompt, and the `is_prime()` function serves as an efficient primality checker for positive integers. 

The `is_prime()` function is essential for checking whether an integer is a prime number or not. It does so by iterating through a range of integers from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if the number is divisible by any of them. If it is, then it returns `False`. If it isn't, then it returns `True`. 

This approach has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)), which is the highest for any primality checking algorithm, however it's a very robust method that guarantees accuracy. It's worth noting that the primality test utilized here assumes that the input is a positive integer, and does not handle negative numbers or zero appropriately. Hence, the `intersection()` function initially validates the inputs are two valid intervals, and then proceeds to check their intersection length for primality.
