The `is_prime` function is used to determine if a number is prime. We then use this function to evaluate whether the length of the intersection of two intervals is prime. Two intervals are considered to intersect if the maximum of their starts is less than or equal to the minimum of their ends. The `intersection` function returns "YES" if the intersection length is prime, and "NO" otherwise. Additionally, if the intervals do not intersect, we also return "NO".

This solution passes all the test cases outlined in the problem statement.
