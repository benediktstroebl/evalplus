The algorithm consists of two parts:
1. A helper function `is_prime` checks whether a given number `n` is a prime number or not. The function uses a basic primality testing algorithm which checks if the given number is less than or equal to 1, it returns `False`. If the number is greater than 1, it iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number, if at any point the divisor is 0, meaning that `n % i == 0`, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes, the function returns `True`. 

2. The `intersection` function converts the given intervals to Python intervals, `start` is the maximum start and `end` is the minimum end, meaning that any intersection would be within these limits. The function checks if the length is less than 0, which means there is no intersection, it returns `NO`. Then, it calls the `is_prime` function to determine if the length of the intersection is prime. If it is, it returns `YES`, otherwise, it returns `NO`. 

This algorithm passes all the test cases provided in the original prompt, and the code is self-contained. 
It's important to note that the algorithm provided is simple and straightforward, but it may not be the most efficient option for checking primality in all cases. There are more efficient algorithms with larger time complexity but faster practice performance for larger numbers, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes.  If you are interested in learning more about primality testing algorithms, I'd be happy to provide some information on them!
