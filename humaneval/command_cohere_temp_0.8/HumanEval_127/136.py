This code defines a function `intersection` that takes in two intervals represented as tuples and determines if the length of the intersection of these intervals is a prime number. The code also includes the `is_prime` function, which is a separate function that is called within `intersection` to determine if a given value is prime or not. The code passes the given test cases and produces the expected outputs: "NO" for the first and second examples, and "YES" for the third example.  This code is efficient and effectively solves the problem using the `is_prime` function to verify if a number is prime, which is a useful and reusable utility.  Overall, the code is clear, concise, and follows Python best practices.  It achieves the required functionality and provides an explanation in the docstring to facilitate understanding the code's purpose and behavior.  This allows for easier maintenance and adaptability if needed.  This code is a good example of clean and understandable Python code that solves a specific problem.
