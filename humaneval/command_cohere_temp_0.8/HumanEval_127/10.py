The function relies on the `is_prime` helper function, which determines whether a given integer is a prime number or not. 

For the main challenge, the `intersection` function verifies if the two intervals overlap, with the help of some quick checks to determine whether the intervals have any possibility of intersection. If they do overlap, the function calculates the length of the intersection and passes this length to the `is_prime` function to determine whether it is a prime number or not. 

The overall time complexity of this solution is O(L), where L is the length of the intersection of the two intervals.

This approach allows the code to accurately solve the challenge and pass all the given tests.
