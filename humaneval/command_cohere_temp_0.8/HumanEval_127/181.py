The function relies on the `is_prime` function to determine whether the length of the intersection of the two intervals is prime or not. The `intersection` function checks if the two intervals are not overlapping first, then it uses `is_prime` to check if the length of the intersection is prime or not. The function returns "YES" if the length is prime, and "NO" otherwise.  The code should work correctly for the given inputs and scenarios.  It is important to note that the primary focus is on readability and maintainability in this code, which may result in slightly less efficient code than the optimal one.
