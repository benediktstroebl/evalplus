The `is_prime` function is used to determine if a given positive integer is a prime number or not. It checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, or if it has any divisors between 2 and the square root of the number. If any divisors are found, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. 

The `intersection` function calculates the maximum and minimum values of the two intervals, and if the resulting interval is empty, it returns `NO`. If the interval is not empty, it calculates its length and checks if this length is prime using the `is_prime` function. If it is prime, it returns `YES`; otherwise, it returns `NO`.  This approach guarantees a correct solution in `O(log(min(a, b)))`, where `a` and `b` are the lengths of the input intervals. 

The example tests provided in the prompt reply correctly as follows:
```
intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) ==> "NO"
intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) ==> "NO"
intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) ==> "YES"
``` 
This solution's time complexity is linear w.r.t the size of the input interval at the worst case.
