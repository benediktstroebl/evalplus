The `is_prime` function is used to check if a given number is prime. 

The `intersection` function calculates the length of the intersection of two intervals, and then calls `is_prime` to check if the length of the intersection is prime.

The code also includes some logic to handle cases where the intervals do not intersect or overlap. 

The `intersection` function is called with sample inputs, and the appropriate output is returned based on the scenario.

Thus, the code provides an effective and efficient way of solving the problem and achieves the desired results.
