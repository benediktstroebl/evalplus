The function utilizes a recursive primality testing function, `is_prime`, and a helper function, `intersection`, to determine whether the length of the intersection of two intervals is prime. The function returns "YES" if the intersection is prime and "NO" if it is not. Additionally, the function returns "NO" if the intervals do not intersect.

Let's break down the code: 
- The `is_prime` function implements an optimized primality testing algorithm. It first checks if the input number is less than or equal to `1`, returning `False` if so. The function further checks if the input is `2` or `3`, both of which are prime, and returns `True`. For numbers between `4` and `1000000`, the function performs a fast primality check using the fact that these numbers can be expressed as 6k Â± 1. Finally, for numbers greater than `1000000`, the function uses the Miller-Rabin primality test, a probabilistic algorithm.
- The `intersection` function takes two interval tuples as input and determines whether their intersection is prime. It first checks if the end of the first interval is greater than the second interval's start or vice versa, returning `NO` if they do not intersect. 
- If the intervals intersect, it calculates the length of the intersection and checks if it's prime using the previously defined `is_prime` function. If the length is prime, it returns `YES`; otherwise, it returns `NO`. To handle potential floating-point errors that could lead to inaccurate results, the code employs careful checks and max() and min() functions to ensure the correct values are being evaluated. 

You can test the code by calling the `intersection` function with different intervals as shown in the provided [input/output] samples.  This approach delivers a timely solution for primality testing, ensuring both accuracy and efficiency.  The code has a Time Complexity of O(log(n)) for the is_prime function and O(1) for the intersection function. Additionally, the Space Complexity is O(1) for both functions.  This makes the code practical for
