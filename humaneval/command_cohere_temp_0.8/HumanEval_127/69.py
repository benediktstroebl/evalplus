The function `is_prime` is a helper function used to check if a number is prime. The function `intersection` is the main function that takes in two intervals, s1 and s2, and determines whether the length of their intersection is a prime number. It checks if the maximum end point of either interval is less than the minimum start point of either interval. If this is the case, then there is no intersection and it returns "NO". If not, it calculates the length of the intersection and passes this length to the is_prime function to determine if it's a prime number. It returns "YES" if the length of the intersection is a prime number and "NO" if it is not. 

Here is how you call the function: 
```python
print(intersection((1, 2), (2, 3))) # prints "NO"
print(intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4))) # prints "NO"
print(intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5))) # prints "YES"
```
