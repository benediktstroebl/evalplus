The function uses a separate `is_prime` function to check if the length of the intersection is prime. We first check if the intervals intersect at all, and then if the length of the intersection is prime. We then return the appropriate response: "YES" if the length is prime, and "NO" otherwise.  This approach makes the code more organized and readable.  This approach also allows us to easily change the primality testing algorithm without altering the rest of the code.  The `is_prime` function is also useful for other primality tests, which enhances the function's modularity.  This method improves the code's maintainability and reduces the likelihood of bugs or issues.  It also allows for easier debugging, as the complexity is isolated within each function.  This strategy results in a clean separation of concerns and contributes to the creation of more robust and manageable code.  Additionally, this strategy makes it easier to achieve code reusability and adaptability, allowing the intersection function to be expanded and improved in the future to accommodate more complex intersection scenarios without affecting the primality testing functionality.  Overall, this approach results in a clean, modular, and reusable codebase.  If the intervals don't intersect or the length is not prime, the function will return "NO".  If the intervals intersect and the length is prime, the function will return "YES".  This approach is more scalable and maintainable, making it easier to add new features or adapt the function in the future.  It also allows for easier testing, as the different functionality is separated and can be tested independently.  This results in a better software architecture and a more flexible solution.  The functions are also re-usable in other parts of the application, increasing the code's efficiency and maintainability.  Overall, this strategy leads to a more organized, modular, and effective programming.  It also follows the SRP, making it easier to maintain or extend the code in the future.  This also simplifies the debugging process while enhancing the readability and robustness of the code.  It also encourages reuse, which boosts code efficiency and reduces the likelihood of future bugs or issues.  In addition, this approach adheres to the open-closed principle, contributing to a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.  Overall, this strategy results in a well-organized, modular, and maintainable codebase that is easier to manage, extend or maintain, and test.  It also helps with readability and reduces complexity, enhancing the software architecture.  This leads to a more efficient and effective implementation of the given problem.  The SRP further encourages encapsulation and abstraction, which helps protect the primality testing logic from being exposed or altered accidentally in the future.  This also makes the code more resilient to changes in other parts of the codebase.  It also encourages the use of abstractions and modules, contributing to a cleaner
