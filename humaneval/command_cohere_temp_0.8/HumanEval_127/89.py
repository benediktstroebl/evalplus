The approach used to solve this problem involves:
1. Determining the Intersection: The first step involves calculating the intersection of the two given intervals. This is done by finding the maximum value between the start and end values of both intervals, and subsequent typecasting to integers for handling numerical differences.
2. Sieving Principle: The length of the intersection is then checked for primality using a basic sieve technique. This involves checking the divisibility of the intersection length by all numbers from 2 to the square root of the length. If the length is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is deemed prime. 
3. Outcome Analysis: The final step involves analyzing the outcome: If the length of the intersection is less than or equal to 1, it is not considered a meaningful intersection, so the function returns "NO". If the length is prime, the function returns "YES". If the length is not prime, the function also returns "NO". This approach ensures that the provided problem is accurately solved. 

This function can be optimized further, but this basic version will correctly answer the question you posted.
