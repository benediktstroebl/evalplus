The function uses a separate `is_prime` function to check if the intersection length `interval_length` is prime. It also includes a check to ensure that the intervals overlap at all, returning "NO" if they don't.

This script can be run standalone, and it successfully passes the tests provided in the specification. 
```python
test = lambda : intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) == "NO" and intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) == "NO" and intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) == "YES"
``` 
The overall time complexity of the script is O(sqrt(n)) for both functions, where `n` is the length of the intersection of the two intervals.  This is because the `is_prime` function iterates through every integer between 2 and the square root of `n`, checking for divisibility.  This remains efficient even for large values of `n` as the square root of `n` increases much slower than `n` itself.  The `intersection` function performs a maximum of two integer comparisons and one calculation of the maximum and minimum of the two intervals, leading to an O(1) time complexity.  This makes the overall time complexity of the script dependent on the `is_prime` function, leading to a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)).  This is efficient and allows the script to handle large values of `n`.  This complex Fiction of the script allows it to pass a large number of tests involving different scenarios and values of `n`.  This makes it a robust and efficient solution to the problem asked.  Overall, the script is designed to be efficient and robust, completing the task within a reasonable time complex.
