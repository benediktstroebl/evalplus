The function `intersection()` takes two interval endpoints as input and calculates the length of the intersection of the intervals. Then, the prime checking function `is_prime()` is used to verify if the length of the intersection is prime. 
The code also handles the edge case where the intervals do not intersect or the intersection length is less than or equal to 0.

Let's continue with some further examples to test the edge cases and further understanding of the code.

**Testing Edge Cases:**
```python
print(intersection((2, 3), (4, 6)))  # Intersection is (4, 5) with size 5
print(intersection((-5, 0), (0, 4)))  # No intersection, outputs "NO"
print(intersection((-5, -1), (1, 5)))  # Reverse order of intervals, outputs "YES"
```

This should output:
```
NO
NO
YES
```

**Understanding the Code:**
Here's a breakdown of the code to better explain how it works:
- The function `is_prime()` is a helper function to check if a given number is prime. It iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number, and checks if the number is divisible by any of them. If the number is divisible by any of these factors, it returns `False`. If it's not, it returns `True`.
- The `intersection()` function takes two sets of interval endpoints, s1 and s2. They are sorted to make the computation easier. The size of the intersection is then calculated using the formula:
    - `size_of_intersection = abs(end1 - start2) + abs(end2 - start1) - min(end1, end2) + max(start1, start2)`

It then checks if the size of the intersection is less than or equal to 0, in which case it returns "NO" because there is no intersection or the intersection size is less than or equal to 0.

Then, there's a check if the size of the intersection is prime using the `is_prime()` function. If it is, it returns "YES". If it's not, it returns "NO".

Overall, the code calculates the size of the intersection, checks if it's valid (non-negative), and then determines if it's prime. The strategy is sound and efficient for this problem.
