The function `intersection()` takes two intervals, each represented as a tuple (start, end), and returns "YES" if the length of their intersection is a prime number, "NO" otherwise. The function determines whether the difference between the end and start of the intersection is prime using the `is_prime()` function. The `is_prime()` function implements a primality test tailored for quicker determination of non-primality. It checks whether the number is less than or equal to 1, whether it's 2 or 3, or whether it's divisible by 2 or 3, then begins iterating through numbers of the form 5k Â± 2, starting from 5. It returns False if any divisibility is found before reaching the square root of the number. This approach allows for more efficient prime checking for ranges involved in interval intersections.  The code passes the test cases provided in the prompt, including edge cases.
