The function `intersection()` calculates the length of the intersection of the two given intervals and then calls `is_prime()` to determine if the length of the intersection is prime. 

You can ensure the function `is_prime()` works correctly by testing it with known prime and non-prime numbers. Here is a list of test cases for prime numbers:
- `is_prime(0)` -> `False`
- `is_prime(1)` -> `False`
- `is_prime(2)` -> `True`
- `is_prime(3)` -> `True`
- `is_prime(4)` -> `False`
- `is_prime(5)` -> `True`
- `is_prime(6)` -> `False`
- `is_prime(7)` -> `True`
- `is_prime(8)` -> `False`
- `is_prime(9)` -> `False`
- `is_prime(10)` -> `False`

If you would like to test more prime numbers, you can add more test cases in a similar format to the above. 

The markdown code block in the question prompt can be added at the beginning of the script to provide clarity to the problem statement and specifications of the problem. 

This code can be added at the beginning of the script:
```
```python
# Problem Statement:
def intersection(interval1, interval2):
    """You are given two intervals,
    where each interval is a pair of integers. For example, interval = (start, end) = (1, 2).
    The given intervals are closed which means that the interval (start, end)
    includes both start and end.
    For each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less or equal its end.
    Your task is to determine whether the length of intersection of these two 
    intervals is a prime number.
    Example, the intersection of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3)
    which its length is 1, which not a prime number.
    If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return "YES",
    otherwise, return "NO".
    If the two intervals don't intersect, return "NO".


    [input/output] samples:
    intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) ==> "NO"
    intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) ==> "NO"
    intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) ==> "YES"
    """
```
```

This clearly defines the problem statement and the expected input/output samples for the `intersection()` function.
