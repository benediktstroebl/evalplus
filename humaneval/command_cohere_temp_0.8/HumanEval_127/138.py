The above code includes all necessary functions to solve the given problem. The `is_prime` function is used to determine if a given number is prime. And the `intersection` function is used to determine the intersection between two given intervals. The `intersection` checks if the intervals overlap and the length of the overlap is prime, it returns "YES", otherwise it returns "NO". 
If you want to test it, you can create a file called `test.txt` and add tests like:
```
# Test 1
intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) ==> "NO"

# Test 2
intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) ==> "NO"

# Test 3
intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) ==> "YES"
```
And then run the script with the `python` command and the path to the `test.txt` file:
```
python test.txt
``` 
It should print out the results of the tests, and all of them should return the expected output based on the problem statement.
