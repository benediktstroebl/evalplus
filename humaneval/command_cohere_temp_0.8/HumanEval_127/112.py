The function `intersection` takes two closed interval pairs as input, calculates the length of their intersection, and then checks if this length is a prime number.

The `is_prime` function is used to determine whether a given integer is a prime number. It iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number, checking for divisibility. If the number is divisible by any integer in this range, it returns `False`. If it is not, it returns `True`. 

Both prime checking algorithms are efficient and deterministic. 

This code demonstrates a practical implementation of mathematical concepts like primes and intervals, resulting in a function that effectively answers the question posed.
