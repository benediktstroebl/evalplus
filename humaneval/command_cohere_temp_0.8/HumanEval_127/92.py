```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def intersection(s1, s2):
    st, ed = max(s1[0], s2[0]), min(s1[1], s2[1])
    if st > ed:
        return "NO"
    elif is_prime(st - ed + 1):
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"
```

The approach uses a simple algorithm to determine if a number is prime or not. The algorithm checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, which it is not. Then, it checks if the number is divisible by 2 or 3, and since the number is not divisible by 2 or 3, it is a prime number. 

The function `intersection()` takes two intervals represented by pairs as input. It checks if the intersection exists and if the length of the intersection is prime. The output is either "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions mentioned in the prompt.

This code includes the necessary logic to solve the problem and should work correctly for the given inputs. Feel free to test it with other inputs as well. If you have any doubts or would like to optimize or clarify anything, let's discuss further!
