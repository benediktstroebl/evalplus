The `is_prime` function checks whether a given integer `n` is a prime number or not. It checks if `n` is less than or equal to `1`, in which case it returns `False`. Then, it checks for the divisibility of `n` by all integers from `2` to the square root of `n`, if `n` is divisible by any of them, it returns `False`. If none of these conditions are met, it returns `True`. 

The `intersection` function defines the main logic of the solution. It checks whether the given intervals overlap or not. If they do not overlap, it returns `"NO"`. Then, it calculates the length of the intersection of the two intervals using the `s` variable as the difference between the maximum of the two ends and the minimum of the two starts. If the length of the intersection is not prime, it returns `"NO"`. Otherwise, it returns `"YES"`. 

Here's an example of how you can use the above function:
```python
print(intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)))  # Output: "NO"
print(intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)))  # Output: "NO"
print(intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5))) # Output: "YES"
```

The provided example tests each edge case as described in the problem statement.
