The function `intersection()` takes in two tuple arguments, which represent the two intervals. It then checks whether the interval intersection is valid by comparing the start of each interval to the end of the other interval with the `not (s1[0] <= s2[1] and s2[0] <= s1[1])` statement. Then it calculates the length of the intersection and checks if it's prime with the `is_prime()` function mentioned earlier. If the intersection is prime, it returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO". 
The `is_prime()` function checks whether a given number is prime or not. It starts by handling the case when the input is 1 or less than that, where it returns False. It then iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the input and checks whether the input is divisible by any of them. If the input is divisible by any of them, it returns False. If the input is not divisible by any of the numbers, it returns True. Performing a square root pruning on the divisor checking loop significantly reduces its runtime.

Here is an example of how to use the `intersection()` function:
```python
print(intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)))
```

This would output:
```
YES
```

This is because the intersection of the two intervals (-3, -1) and (-5, 5) is (-4, 1), and the length of the intersection is 2, which is a prime number. 

The `is_prime()` function can also be used separately to check if a given number is prime. 

Note: The `is_prime()` function is an optimized version of the classic Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. It works efficiently for the recommended intervals in the given problem statement.
