The `is_prime` function is used to determine if a number is prime. The `intersection` function determines if the intervals intersect and then checks if the length of the intersection is prime. 

The Python script's self-contained function `intersection` can be used to solve the problem and passes the test cases provided. Let's take a quick look at how the functions work:
1. The `is_prime` function: It takes an integer `n` as an argument and checks if it is prime. The function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, returning False if so, since prime numbers always exceed 1. It then iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of `n`, checking if `n` is divisible by any of them. If it is, False is returned, indicating that `n` is not a prime number. If no divisors are found, True is returned, indicating that `n` is a prime number.
2. The `intersection` function: It takes two tuple arguments, `s1` and `s2`, which represent the start and end values of the two intervals. The function first checks whether the intervals intersect by ensuring that the start of either interval is less than or equal to the end of the other interval. If this condition is met, it calculates the length of the intersection by subtracting the start of the second interval from the end of the first interval and taking the absolute value to handle negative intervals. It then uses the is_prime function to determine whether the length of the intersection is prime. If it is, the function returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO."

A utility function to check for prime numbers is useful and often comes up in various problems. The `intersection` function is specific to the current problem but is a good use of abstraction to handle the nuanced rules of interval intersection.
