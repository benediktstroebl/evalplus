The `is_prime` function checks whether a given positive integer `n` is a prime number or not using a simple iterative primality testing algorithm. It iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of `n`, and if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it returns `False`. If `n` is not divisible by any of them, it returns `True`. 

The `intersection` function calculates the intersection of two intervals, calculates its length, and then calls `is_prime` to determine if the length is prime. If the length is prime, it returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO". Also, if the start of the second interval is after the end of the first interval, it returns "NO" since there is no intersection.  The overall time complexity of this code is O(N^(1/2)), where N is the number of pixels.

Here is how you call these functions to test it:
```python
# Test Cases
print(intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)))
print(intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)))
print(intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)))
```

The output should be:
```
YES
NO
NO
```
