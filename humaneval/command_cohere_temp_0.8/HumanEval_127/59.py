The function relies on the `is_prime` function to determine whether the length of the intersection of the two intervals is prime. We then simply check for intersection and pass the length to is_prime for prime checking. The code also utilizes the `range` function to iterate through numbers efficiently and the `max` and `min` functions to calculate the length of the intersection. 
The `range` function in the `is_prime` function has a limit set to `int(n**0.5) + 1`, which is an optimization that limits the range to sensible values and improves the performance of the algorithm, based on the prime number theory.

This code will compile and run without any errors, and it will correctly solve the problem, as shown in the provided tests.
