The script utilizes the `is_prime` helper function to determine whether a number is prime. The `intersection` function takes in two interval tuples, and returns "YES" if the length of the intersection is prime, and "NO" otherwise. Additionally, if the intervals do not intersect, it also returns "NO". This approach handles all test cases accordingly.  This implementation has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)) for each tested number, where n is the number of pixels, with a maximum of O(n) for the prime testing.  This complexity is justified since the algorithm iterates through each pixel once, and for each pixel, it tests whether it's prime, which takes O(sqrt(n)) time.  Overall, the algorithm is efficient and suitable for handling the given problem.  This approach handles all test cases accordingly.
