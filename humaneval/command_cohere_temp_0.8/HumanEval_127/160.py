The `is_prime` function is used to determine if a given positive integer is a prime number or not. The `intersection` function is the main function that takes in two intervals, calculates the length of the intersection, and then checks if the length of the intersection is a prime number or not. If the length of the intersection is not prime, it returns "NO". If the length of the intersection is prime, it returns "YES". If the two intervals don't intersect, it also returns "NO". 

This implementation has a time complexity of O(1) since the only operation that might take some time is the `is_prime` function, and its time complexity is O(sqrt(n)), but this is not a problem in this case as `length` is always smaller than `n` in this case.
