The `is_prime` function is used to determine if a given positive integer is a prime number or not. It checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, it returns False; and if the number is greater than 1, it checks whether it has any divisors from 2 to the square root of the number, if it does, it returns False. If the number is greater than 1 and doesn't have any divisors in the given range, it returns True.

The `intersection` function calculates the length of the intersection of two given closed intervals a and b, and then calls `is_prime` to determine if the length of the intersection is a prime number or not. If the intersection length is prime, it returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO".

The above solution has a time complexity of O(1) for the `is_prime` function, and a variable time complexity for the `intersection` function, depending on the intervals' sizes.
