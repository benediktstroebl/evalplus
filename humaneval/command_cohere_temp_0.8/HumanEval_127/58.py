The method 'is_prime' is included in the code, which determines whether a given number is prime or not. The 'intersection' function now correctly handles cases where the intervals do not intersect or when the intersection length is prime. Tests are passed accordingly. 

You can test this function with different input intervals to see if it works as expected. You can add more test cases to the markdown code block for further evaluation.
