The `is_prime` function checks whether a number is prime or not. It loops from 2 to the square root of the number and checks for divisibility. If the number is divisible by any integer in that range it returns `False`. If the number is not divisible by any integer in that range it returns `True`. The `intersection` function calculates the intersection of two intervals, then checks whether the length of the intersection is prime using the `is_prime` function. If the length is prime, it returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO". This approach ensures that the length is prime without repeatedly checking primality for each interval that is encountered. 
The following is a sample output of the function when tested:
```
intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) ==> "YES"
intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) ==> "NO"
intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) ==> "NO"
``` 

This output validates that the function behaves accordingly.
