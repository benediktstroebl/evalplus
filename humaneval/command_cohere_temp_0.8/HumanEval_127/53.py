```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def intersection(s1, s2):
    st, ed = max(s1[0], s2[0]), min(s1[1], s2[1])
    if st > ed:
        return "NO"
    elif is_prime(st - ed + 1):
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"
```

The approach works as follows:
1. Determine the maximum and minimum values of the two intervals and calculate the length of the intersection.
2. If the intersection length is less than or equal to 0, return "NO" because there is no intersection.
3. If the intersection's length is prime, return "YES".
4. If the intersection's length is not prime, return "NO".

This problem can be solved using more efficient algorithms; this solution is meant to be self-contained and easy to understand. 
If you'd like a more efficient solution, we can discuss it further. Gebruiker:

To test this function, you can add the following snippet after the function definition:
```python
test_samples = [
    ([1, 2], [2, 3], "NO"),
    ([-1, 1], [0, 4], "NO"),
    ([-3, -1], [-5, 5], "YES"),
    ([1, 3], [2, 4], "NO")
]

for s1, s2, expected in test_samples:
    actual = intersection(s1, s2)
    assert actual == expected, f"Expected {expected}, but got {actual} for inputs {s1} and {s2}"
```

This will ensure that the function behaves as expected and aligns with the problem statement. Adjust the `test_samples` list and expected outputs if needed.
