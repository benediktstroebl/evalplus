The `is_prime` function is used to determine if a number is prime. The function takes a number as input and returns a boolean value of `True` if the number is prime, and `False` if the number is not prime. This function is used by the `intersection` function to determine if the length of the intersection of two intervals is prime. 

The `intersection` function takes two interval pairs as input and returns a string indicating whether the length of the intersection of the two intervals is a prime number. The function first checks if the end of the interval is less than the start of the interval, in which case there is no intersection, returning `NO`. When there is an intersection, it calculates the length of the intersection and uses the `is_prime` function to determine if the length of the intersection is prime or not. 

Overall, the code provides an accurate and efficient way to solve the given problem.
