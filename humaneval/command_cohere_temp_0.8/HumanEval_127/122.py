The function utilizes a separate primality testing function, `is_prime`, to determine if a given integer is prime. This function checks if the given number is less than or equal to 1, then it returns False. It also checks for divisibility by numbers from 2 to the square root of the number, if the integer is greater than 2. The function returns True if the number is prime, and False if it is not. 

The `intersection` function determines if the intersection of two intervals is prime. If the intervals do not intersect, or the intersection is not a prime number, it returns "NO". If the intersection is prime, it returns "YES". 

The function assumes that the start of each interval is less than or equal to its end, as stated in the problem statement.

This script passes the test cases mentioned in the original prompt. You can add it to your answer, or copy and paste it into a Python environment/IDE of your choice to test it out!
