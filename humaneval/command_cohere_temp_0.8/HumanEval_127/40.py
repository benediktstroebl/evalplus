    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False

def intersection(s1, s2):
    st, ed = max(s1[0], s2[0]), min(s1[1], s2[1])
    if st > ed:
        return "NO"
    elif is_prime(st - ed + 1):
        return "YES"
    else:

```

The approach uses a simple algorithm to determine if the intersection's length is prime. The function `is_prime` verifies if a given integer `n` is prime or not. The function employs a combination of conditions to efficiently find divisors and swiftly rule out non-prime values. It starts by checking if `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case it is not prime. For `n` between 2 and 3, it is regarded as prime. The algorithm then checks whether `n` equals 0 (indicating not prime) or whether it is divisible by 2 or 3, both of which are not prime. It then begins a loop starting from 5 (`i = 5`) and examines if the integer is divisible by `i` or `i + 2`. While the loop continues, it systematically rules out multiples of 2 or 3, which are not prime. The loop concludes when `i` exceeds the square root of `n`, ensuring a precise prime determination. If the outcome of the `is_prime` function is `True`, the intersection length is prime; otherwise, it is not prime.
