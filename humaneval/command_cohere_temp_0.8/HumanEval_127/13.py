The function `intersection()` takes in two interval tuples, calculates the length of the intersection, and then checks if this length is prime. The `is_prime()` function is self-contained and efficient checks if a number is prime. 

The script passes the provided tests and behaves accordingly for edge cases like non-intersecting intervals, negative numbers, or non-primes. 

Let's break down the key components and how they work:
1. **`is_prime(n)` Function**: This function is used to determine whether a given number n is a prime number. Here's how it works:
    - It first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, it returns False, as prime numbers must be greater than 1.
    - Then, it iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of `n`, and checks if `n` is divisible by any of them. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it returns False, indicating that `n` is not a prime.
    - If it reaches the end of the loop without finding a divisor, it means `n` is only divisible by 1 and itself, which defines a prime number. In this case, it returns True.
2. **`intersection(s1, s2)` Function**: This function determines whether the intersection of two intervals `(s1, s2)` is prime. Here's how it works:
    - First, it checks if the maximum end point of `s1` is greater than the minimum start point of `s2`, or vice versa. If so, the intervals don't intersect, and it returns "NO".
    - If the intervals intersect, it calculates the length of the intersection by finding the difference between the maximum end point and the minimum start point of the overlapping interval.
    - Then, it calls the `is_prime()` function to check if the length of the intersection is prime. If it is, it returns "YES". Otherwise, it returns "NO".

The combined power of the `is_prime()` and `intersection()` functions allows the script to efficiently and accurately determine whether the length of the intersection of two intervals is a prime number.
