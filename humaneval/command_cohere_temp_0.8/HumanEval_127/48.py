The function utilizes the `is_prime` function to determine if the length of the intersection of two intervals is prime. 
It first checks if the intervals overlap at all, and if so, calculates the length of the intersection, 
then calls `is_prime` to determine if the length is prime. 

It returns "YES" if the length is prime and "NO" otherwise.  This approach allows the code to be self-contained and modular, 
as well as easily understandable and maintainable.  Any further optimizations or improvements to this approach could 
potentially utilize more complex and computationally expensive primality testing algorithms, but at the expense of 
code complexity and speed.  This current approach is a good balance between efficiency and simplicity.
