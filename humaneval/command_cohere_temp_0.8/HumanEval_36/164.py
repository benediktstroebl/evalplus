Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    # Filter out the numbers from 1 to n that are divisible by 11 or 13
    relevant_numbers = [i for i in range(1, n + 1) if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0]
    # Count the number of times the digit 7 appears in the filtered numbers
    return sum(1 for num in relevant_numbers if '7' in str(num))
```
This code leverages Python's distinct capability for list comprehension and regex-like filtering and manipulation using in-built functions. The function iterates through numbers from 1 to n, checking for divisibility by 11 or 13. Upon identifying these numbers, it examines each one's digits for the presence of '7' using a generator expression within the sum function, counting their occurrences. This process allows the function to determine the total count of '7' in numbers up to n that are divisible by 11 or 13. 
```python
assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0
assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2
assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3
``` 
This script addresses the problem in a concise and effective manner, yet provides clarity for fellow programmers to easily comprehend the logic and intent of the code. For easier comprehension, I've included docstrings and commented on the code to elucidate the purpose of each step.
