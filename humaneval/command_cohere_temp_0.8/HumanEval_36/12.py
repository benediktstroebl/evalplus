Here's a Python script with a self-contained function `fizz_buzz` that solves the problem:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    # Filter out numbers less than n, include only those divisible by 11 or 13
    relevant_numbers = [num for num in range(n) if num % 11 == 0 or num % 13 == 0]
    # Count the number of 7s in the filtered numbers
    seven_count = sum(1 for num in relevant_numbers if num % 10 == 7)
    return seven_count

# Test Cases
assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0
assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2
assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3
```

This script defines the `fizz_buzz` function as per the problem statement and includes test cases to verify its correctness against the given expected outputs.
