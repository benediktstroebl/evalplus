Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    less_than_n = [int(x) for x in range(n - 1, 0, -1)]
    return sum(1 for x in less_than_n if x % 11 == 0 or x % 13 == 0 and 7 in str(x))
```
This code defines a function fizz_buzz that calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13. It does this by first creating a list of all the integers from n - 1 down to 1, inclusive. It then iterates through each integer in this list, checking if the integer is divisible by 11 or 13. If the integer is divisible by either of these numbers, it checks if the digit 7 appears in the integer's representation as a string. The function returns the number of such integers, counting the occurrences of 7 as requested. 

Here is a test case to ensure the functionality of the code:
```python
assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0
```

And another test case:
```python
assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2
```

And finally, another test case:
```python
assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3
```
These test cases ensure that the function fizz_buzz returns the expected results for the given inputs.
