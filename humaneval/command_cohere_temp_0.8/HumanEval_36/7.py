Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    # Filter out numbers less than n, include only those divisible by 11 or 13
    relevant_numbers = [num for num in range(n) if num % 11 == 0 or num % 13 == 0]
    # Count the number of 7s in the filtered numbers
    seven_count = sum(1 for num in relevant_numbers if num % 7 == 0)
    return seven_count

# Test Cases
assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0
assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2
assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3
```

This script defines the `fizz_buzz` function, which takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13. The function first filters out the relevant numbers using a list comprehension, then counts the frequency of 7 using a sum function with a generator expression. The test cases verify the function's behavior against the specified conditions. The code includes comments to enhance comprehension.  This solution is efficient and directly answers the problem statement without introducing any extraneous concepts.
