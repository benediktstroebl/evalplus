Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    less_than_n = [int(x) for x in range(n - 1, 1, -1)]
    return sum(1 for x in less_than_n if x % 11 == 0 or x % 13 == 0 and 7 in str(x))
```
This function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of integers less than n and then uses another iteration to count the numbers divisible by 11 or 13 and containing the digit 7. The final result will be the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.

Here's the markdown code block as required:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    less_than_n = [int(x) for x in range(n - 1, 1, -1)]
    return sum(1 for x in less_than_n if x % 11 == 0 or x % 13 == 0 and 7 in str(x))
```
