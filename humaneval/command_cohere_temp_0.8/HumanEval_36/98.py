Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    # Generate a list of integers from 0 to n-1.
    num_list = list(range(n))
    # Filter out numbers that are divisible by 11 or 13.
    div_by_11_or_13 = [num for num in num_list if num % 11 == 0 or num % 13 == 0]
    # Count the number of times 7 appears in the filtered list of integers.
    return sum(1 for num in div_by_11_or_13 if num % 7 == 0)
```
This code solves the problem by creating a list of all the integers from 0 to n-1. It then filters this list to include only those integers that are divisible by 11 or 13. After that, it counts the number of times the digit 7 appears in the filtered list and returns this count.

To follow the test examples provided in the problem statement, the function can be invoked as follows:
```python
>>> fizz_buzz(50)
0
>>> fizz_buzz(78)
2
>>> fizz_buzz(79)
3
```
