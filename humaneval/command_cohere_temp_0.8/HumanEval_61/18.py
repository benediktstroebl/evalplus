```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open_brackets = brackets.count('(')
    close_brackets = brackets.count(')')
    return open_brackets == close_brackets
```

This function counts the number of opening and closing brackets using the built-in `count` method. It then returns `True` if the counts are equal, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

Here is a simpler version using a counter:
```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    balance = 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        elif char == ')':
            balance -= 1
        if balance < 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This version increments the counter when it finds an open bracket and decrements it when it finds a close bracket. When the counter goes negative, it returns false.
