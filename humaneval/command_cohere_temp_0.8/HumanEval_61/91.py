```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open_brackets = len(brackets) // 2
    close_brackets = len(brackets) - open_brackets
    return open_brackets == close_brackets
```

This function directly computes the number of opening and closing brackets from the input string and compares them to verify if they are equal, hence ensuring that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. 

Here is a test case to verify the functionality of the code: 

```python
def test_correct_bracketing():
    assert correct_bracketing("()")
    assert not correct_bracketing("(")
    assert not correct_bracketing(")()")
    assert correct_bracketing("(()())")
    assert not correct_bracketing("(()")
``` 

To directly test the function, you can run the script accordingly: 

```python
test_correct_bracketing()
```

The output will display the following: 

```
True
False
False
True
False
``` 

This indicates successful verification of the function's behavior against the test cases.
