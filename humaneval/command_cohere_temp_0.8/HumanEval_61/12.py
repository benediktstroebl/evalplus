```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open_brackets = len(brackets) - brackets.count('(')
    close_brackets = len(brackets) - brackets.count(')')
    return open_brackets == close_brackets
```

This function directly computes the difference between the total length of the string and the number of '(' and ')' characters to determine whether the number of opening and closing brackets is consistent. It can be explained as follows:
```
1. **len(brackets)**: This gives the length of the input string, i.e., the total number of characters present.
2. **brackets.count('(')**: This counts the number of '(' characters. For example, for the input "(()())", it would return 2.
3. **brackets.count(')')**: This counts the number of ')' characters. Also, for the input "(()())", it would return 2.
4. **open_brackets**: It is computed as **len(brackets) - brackets.count(')')**. This gives the count of opening brackets without the closing brackets.
5. **close_brackets** is computed as **len(brackets) - brackets.count('(')** which gives the count of closing brackets without the opening brackets.
6. **return open_brackets == close_brackets**: Whether the number of opening and closing brackets is consistent, the function returns True if they are the same, and False otherwise.
```
This approach directly computes the necessary information for comparison, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
