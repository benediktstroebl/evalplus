```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open_brackets = brackets.count('(')
    close_brackets = brackets.count(')')
    return open_brackets == close_brackets
```

This function uses the `count` method to efficiently count the occurrences of '(' and ')' in the string and then compares the counts to return the desired result.
