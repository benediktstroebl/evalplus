```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open_brackets = brackets.count("(")
    close_brackets = brackets.count(")")
    return open_brackets == close_brackets
```

This function counts the number of '(' and ')' characters in the input string and returns True if the counts are equal, implying that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and vice versa. This solution employs simple string manipulation and counting methods.

Here is a simple test suite that can be used to validate the function:
```python
def test_correct_bracketing():
    assert correct_bracketing("()") == True
    assert correct_bracketing("(()())") == True
    assert correct_bracketing(")(()") == False
    assert correct_bracketing("()){" == False
```
