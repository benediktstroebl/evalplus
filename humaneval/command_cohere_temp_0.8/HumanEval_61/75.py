```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open_brackets = len(brackets.count('('))
    close_brackets = len(brackets.count(')'))
    return open_brackets == close_brackets
```

This function uses the `count` method to count the number of opening and closing brackets in the given string, and then compares the counts to determine if they are equal, as stipulated by the problem. This approach enables the function to efficiently determine the correct outcome for the given problem without introducing any additional complexities.

Here is a simple test suite that can be used to validate the correctness of the function:
```python
def test_correct_bracketing():
    assert correct_bracketing("()") == True
    assert correct_bracketing("(()())") == True
    assert correct_bracketing(")(())" == False
    assert correct_bracketing("()xx" == False)
    assert correct_bracketing("(xxxx)" == True)

test_correct_bracketing()
``` 
This should return `True` for the first two examples and `False` for the second two. This would confirm the function's correct operation for the given test cases.
