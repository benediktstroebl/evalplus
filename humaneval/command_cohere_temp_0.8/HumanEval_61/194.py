```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open_brackets = len(brackets) - brackets.count('(')
    close_brackets = len(brackets) - brackets.count(')')
    return open_brackets == close_brackets
```

This function directly computes the difference between the total length of the string and the number of '(' and ')' characters to determine whether the number of opening and closing brackets is consistent. It should be noted that this approach has a time complexity of O(n) , where n is the length of the input string, and uses O(1) space to store the input string.

Here is a simple test suite that you can use to validate the functionality of this code:
```python
def test_correct_bracketing():
    assert correct_bracketing("()")
    assert correct_bracketing("(()())")
    assert not correct_bracketing(")(()")
    assert not correct_bracketing("")
    assert not correct_bracketing("(((")
    assert correct_bracketing("((()))"))
``` 
If you want to incorporate these tests into a single script, you can do so by adding the `test_correct_bracketing()` function to the same file as the `correct_bracketing()` function and then running the tests using Python's built-in `unittest` module, e.g., `unittest.main()`.  This approach is commonly used in test-driven development to ensure that the code functions as expected and meets the specified requirements.
