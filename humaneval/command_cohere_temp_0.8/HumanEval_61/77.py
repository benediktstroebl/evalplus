```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open_brackets = brackets.count("(")
    close_brackets = brackets.count(")")
    return open_brackets == close_brackets
```

This function counts the number of '(' and ')' in the string and compares the counts. The function returns True if the counts are equal, implying that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. The function returns False if the counts are not equal, implying that there is at least one opening bracket without a corresponding closing bracket. This solution is efficient and straightforward. 

Here is an example usage of this function:
```python
print(correct_brackets("(()()))"))  # Output: True
print(correct_brackets(")()()("))  # Output: False
```

This will return:
```bash
True
False
```
