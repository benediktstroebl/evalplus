```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open_brackets = brackets.count("(")
    close_brackets = brackets.count(")")
    return open_brackets == close_brackets
```

This function counts the number of '(' and ')' in the string and returns True if they are equal to ensure that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. 

Here is a simple test suite that can be used to validate the functionality of the above function:
```python
def test_correct_bracketing():
    assert correct_bracketing("()")
    assert not correct_bracketing("(")
    assert not correct_bracketing(")()")
    assert correct_bracketing("(()())")
    assert not correct_bracketing(")(()")
    assert not correct_bracketing("(((")
    assert correct_bracketing("((()))"))
``` 
This will help ensure that the function behaves as expected and aligns with the problem statement outlined in the original prompt.
