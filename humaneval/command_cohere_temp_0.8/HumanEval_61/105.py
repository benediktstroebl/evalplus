```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open_brackets = len(brackets.split('('))
    close_brackets = len(brackets.split(')'))
    return open_brackets == close_brackets
```

This function directly analyzes the input string and counts the number of '(' and ')' characters. It then compares the counts of these two types of brackets, and returns `True` if they are equal, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. 

Here is a simple test case to check if the above function works:
```python
print(correct_bracketing("()"))
```

The above should print `True` as the string "()" has one opening bracket and one closing bracket, indicating a balanced set of brackets. 

To further verify the correctness of the above function, you can also check cases where brackets are not balanced, such as:
```python
print(correct_bracketing("()")) # unbalanced: 1 opening bracket, 2 closing brackets
print(correct_brackets("(()")) # unbalanced: 2 opening brackets, 1 closing bracket
```

The above prints will be:
```bash
False
False
```

These results indicate that the function correctly determines if brackets are balanced. 

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) since it requires splitting the string and counting the number of each type of bracket, where n is the length of the input string.
