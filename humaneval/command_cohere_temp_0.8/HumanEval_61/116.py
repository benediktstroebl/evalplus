```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open_brackets = brackets.count("(")
    close_brackets = brackets.count(")")
    return open_brackets == close_brackets
```

This function counts the number of opening and closing brackets using the built-in `count` method. It then returns `True` if the counts are equal, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and `False` otherwise. This solution is concise and straightforward, directly leveraging string counting methods to solve the problem.

Here is a simple test suite that can be used to validate the function:
```python
def test_correct_bracketing():
    assert correct_bracketing("()") == True
    assert correct_bracketing("(()())") == True
    assert correct_bracketing(")(()") == False
    assert correct_bracketing("""(())))(((""")) == False
```

This test suite contains four test cases, each representing a different scenario of opening and closing brackets. By executing these tests, we can verify that the `correct_bracketing` function behaves as expected and aligns with the problem statement.
