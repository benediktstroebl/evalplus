```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open_brackets = len(brackets) - brackets.count('(')
    close_brackets = len(brackets) - brackets.count(')')
    return open_brackets == close_brackets
```

This function calculates the difference between the total length of the given brackets string and the number of '(' and ')' characters respectively. If these two quantities are equal, then every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, thereby ensuring balance. The given tests demonstrate the correctness of the function. 

Here is an example of an usage of this function:
```python
print(correct_brackets("(()"))  # Output: True
print(correct_brackets("())")  # Output: True
print(correct_brackets("()()"))  # Output: True
print(correct_brackets("()(])"))  # Output: False
```
