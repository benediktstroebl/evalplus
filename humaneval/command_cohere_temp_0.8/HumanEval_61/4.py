```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open_brackets = brackets.count("(")
    close_brackets = brackets.count(")")
    return open_brackets == close_brackets
```

This function counts the number of opening and closing brackets using the built-in `count` method. It then returns `True` if the counts are equal, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and `False` otherwise. This solution is efficient and straightforward, providing the desired result without introducing unnecessary complexity.

Here is a simple test suite that can be used to validate the correctness of the function:
```python
def test_correct_bracketing():
    # Basic Test Cases
    assert correct_bracketing("()") == True
    assert correct_bracketing("(()())") == True
    assert correct_bracketing("())") == False
    assert correct_bracketing("()()") == False

    # More Test Cases
    assert correct_bracketing("acci") == False
    assert correct_bracketing(")(())") == False
    assert correct_bracketing("(()") == False
    assert correct_bracketing("())(") == False
    assert correct_bracketing("""(()))""") == True
    assert correct_bracketing("""(((((())))))""") == True

    # Edge Cases
    assert correct_bracketing("") == True
    assert correct_bracketing("(") == False
    assert correct_bracketing(")")) == False
    assert correct_bracketing("""((()))""") == True

test_correct_bracketing()
```

This test suite includes various test cases, including edge cases, to thoroughly validate the function's behavior.
