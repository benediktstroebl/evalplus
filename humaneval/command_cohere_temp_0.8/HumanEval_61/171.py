```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open_brackets = brackets.count('(')
    close_brackets = brackets.count(')')
    return open_brackets == close_brackets
```

This function uses the `count` method to efficiently count the occurrences of '(' and ')' in the string and then compares these counts to verify if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. 

You can use this function in the given markdown code block to test it with different input scenarios. Simply provide different input strings in the `brackets` parameter and observe the return values. 
For ex: 
```python
correct_bracketing("(()())")
# Returns: True
``` 

This will return `True` as the number of opening brackets (`3`) is equal to the number of closing brackets (`3`).
