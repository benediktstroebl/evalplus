```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open_brackets = len(brackets) != 0 and brackets[0] == "("
    close_brackets = len(brackets) != 0 and brackets[-1] == ")"
    return (open_brackets and close_brackets) or len(brackets) == 2
```

This function checks if the string has a well-formed bracketing structure, verifies if it has an opening bracket `(` and a closing bracket `)`, and returns `True` if the both are present in the string irrespective of their position and if the string has a single pair of parentheses `(` and `)`, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Here is a test suite that can be used to validate the functionality of the function:
```python
def test_correct_bracketing():
    assert correct_bracketing("()")
    assert correct_bracketing("(()())")
    assert correct_bracketing(")(()")
    assert not correct_bracketing("(")
    assert not correct_bracketing("()())")
    assert not correct_bracketing("($40")
    assert correct_bracketing("()[])")
    assert correct_bracketing("([])")
```
