```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open_brackets = len(brackets)
    
    if open_brackets == 0:
        return True
    
    odd = open_brackets % 2
    return (not odd and len(brackets) == open_brackets) or (odd and len(brackets) == open_brackets + 1)
```

This function uses the fact that the number of open brackets is always even to decide if a string of brackets is correctly balanced. For example, after opening `(` and `)` brackets, you must eventually close the same number of brackets.

To test this, the function checks whether the number of open brackets is equal to the number of closing brackets, factoring in the requirement that the number of open brackets is always even. If this condition is fulfilled, the function returns `True`, indicating that the brackets are correctly balanced; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Here is a Markdown code block with corresponding test cases to verify its effectiveness: 
```python
test_cases = [
    ("(", "False"),
    ("()", "True"),
    ("(()())", "True"),
    ("())()", "False"),
    ("(((((((())))))))", "True"),
]

for brackets, expectation in test_cases:
    assert correct_bracketing(brackets) == expectation
```

This code uses the function inside a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a string of brackets and the expected result. The `assert` statement checks whether the result of calling the function with the first element of the tuple is equal to the expected result given by the second element of the tuple. 

This should help you validate the correctness of the function with various test cases. Feel free to add more test cases as needed to cover other corner cases.
