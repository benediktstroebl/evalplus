```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def x_or_y(n, x, y):
    if is_prime(n):
        return x
    else:
        return y

# Tests
n = 7
x = 34
y = 12

print(f'x_or_y({n}, {x}, {y}) == {x_or_y(n, x, y)}')
```

The `is_prime` function is used to determine if a number is prime. If the number is prime, the `x_or_y` function returns its corresponding `x`; otherwise, it returns `y`. The example tests are included to verify the functionality of the solution. The script can be run directly to observe the output. 
This approach allows the program to successfully meet the requirements of the problem statement. 
It keeps the code modular and maintainable by separating the prime number determination from the primary logic. 
This makes it easier to verify the program's correctness and facilitates updates or changes to the prime number calculation approach in the future. A  practical technique for handling this kind of dilemma, where distinct outcomes are required depending on the value of a given input.
