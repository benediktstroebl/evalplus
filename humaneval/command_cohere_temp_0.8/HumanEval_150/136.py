```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def x_or_y(n, x, y):
    if is_prime(n):
        return x
    else:
        return y

# Unit tests
tests = [
    (7, 34, 12, 34),
    (15, 8, 5, 5),
    (2, 42, 10, 10),
    (17, 89, 13, 13)
]

for n, x, y, expected in tests:
    assert x_or_y(n, x, y) == expected
```

This code defines a function `x_or_y` that takes in three arguments - an input number `n`, and two values `x` and `y` - and returns `x` if `n` is prime and `y` if it is not. It also incorporates a unit test section that verifies the function against various test cases. You can use this code to solve the problem and even extend it for more comprehensive tests if needed.
