The `is_prime` function is introduced to provide an efficient primality test. It implements a streamlined algorithm based on the Sieve of Eratosthenes, optimized for faster processing by limiting iterations to only primes up to the square root of the number. This is especially beneficial for larger inputs. 

The `x_or_y` function employs the `is_prime` function to deterministically return `x` if `n` is prime and `y` otherwise. This guarantees a straightforward and efficient implementation.

The unit tests have also been expanded to cover a variety range of scenarios, including edge cases and integer values, to rigorously validate the correctness of the solution.

This approach allows for a fast execution time and an elegant solution that maintains the principle of separation of concerns.
