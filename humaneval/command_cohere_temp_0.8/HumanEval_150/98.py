```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):

        return y

```

This script defines a function `x_or_y` that takes three arguments: an input number `n`, and two optional parameters `x` and `y`. The function returns `x` if `n` is prime and `y` if `n` is not prime. 

It includes a function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime or not. The `is_prime` function returns `True` if the number is prime and `False` otherwise. It iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of `n`, if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it returns `False`.

The script also includes test cases to ensure the function `x_or_y` returns the expected outputs for the given inputs.  The `is_prime` function is used to call `x_or_y` with different numbers and the corresponding correct outputs to ensure the correctness of the `x_or_y` function. 

This code demonstrates a basic use of Python to solve a problem involving prime numbers and provides an elegant way to implement the solution using a separate function for primality testing.  It can form the basis for more complex applications involving primes and could be adapted to optimize the primality testing for larger ranges and different algorithms.  It could also be extended to handle other problems related to primality testing, such as checking if a number is a composite.  This could involve taking additional variables and parameters to test for specific composite numbers.  This would require additional functions to handle the new requirements and scenarios.  This could enhance the flexibility and applicability of such a function to test for composites and primes based on different conditions and parameters.  This could allow for even more complex problems to be addressed by such an approach.  This could involve creating a new function that builds on this one or modifying this function to accept additional parameters and variables.  This could help make the function more general and applicable to a wider range of problems and scenarios.  Such a function could also be used for other problems and could even be adapted to other languages and frameworks with slight modifications.  This could make the function even more flexible and valuable for a wide variety of use cases and scenarios.  Such a general function could also be used to handle a wide range of problems in a variety of domains and applications.  This could make it valuable for different types of tasks and issues that need to be addressed in a variety of contexts.  The primality testing capabilities could also be adapted to provide fast and efficient testing of large numbers, providing optimizations for better performance.  This could involve using more efficient algorithms for primality testing or leveraging specialized hardware and libraries.  These optimizations could allow for even larger numbers to be tested for primality and could provide additional benefits such as faster execution times and reduced resource usage.  These optimizations could also enable new approaches and use cases for primality testing that were not previously feasible due to performance constraints.  This
