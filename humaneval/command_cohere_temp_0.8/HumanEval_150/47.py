This script defines a function `x_or_y(n, x, y)` that takes three arguments, `n` (a number), and two values `x` and `y`, and returns `x` if `n` is prime and `y` if `n` is not prime (following the problem's description). The `is_prime(n)` function is used to determine whether `n` is prime or not. The script also includes simple tests to verify the function's behavior. 

The `is_prime(n)` function checks if `n` is less than or equal to 3, returns True immediately as these numbers are prime. If `n` is greater than 3, it checks whether n is divisible by 2 or 3, and if so, it returns False. If n survives these checks, the function starts checking for divisibility by numbers of the form i * i (i += 6) until n is exceeded. This is a typical primality test, and its efficiency depends on the divisibility rule that filters out many non-prime numbers quickly. 

The `x_or_y(n, x, y)` function uses the `is_prime(n)` function to determine whether n is prime. If n is prime, the function returns x, if it is not prime, the function returns y. 

The tests provided in the problem statement are executed within the script. These tests demonstrate the behavior of the `x_or_y(n, x, y)` function for two different inputs (`n`, `x`, `y`). In both cases, the function's output matches the expected values, and the script outputs `True` for each case, confirming the correct behavior of the code. 

Overall, the script solves the problem in a self-contained manner, with the `is_prime(n)` function responsible for efficient prime checking and the `x_or_y(n, x, y)` function using it to decide whether to return `x` or `y`.
