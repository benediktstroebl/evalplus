# Unit tests
tests = [
    (7, 34, 12, 34),
    (15, 8, 5, 5),
    (101, -5, -10, -10),
    (4, 99, 14, 14),
    (0, 1, 2, 2),
    (2, 3, 4, 4),
]

for n, x, y, expected in tests:
    result = x_or_y(n, x, y)
    if result != expected:
        print(f"For n={n}, x={x} y={y} expected={expected} result={result}"+"'"+"!!!ERROR!!!")
    else:
        print(f"For n={n}, x={x} y={y} expected={expected} result={result}")
```

The code contains a function `x_or_y` that takes three arguments `n` (the input number), `x` (the value to be returned if `n` is prime), and `y` (the value to be returned if `n` is not prime). The function uses the `is_prime` function to determine whether `n` is prime or not and returns `x` or `y` accordingly. 

The script also includes unit tests for the `x_or_y` function, which are displayed with their expected results. 

To debug or modify the code, you can change the values in the list `tests` to check new cases and ensure they will yield the expected results.  This way, you can ensure that the function `x_or_y` behaves as expected throughout different inputs.  You can add additional tests to this list to verify its behavior under different conditions.  If you encounter any unexpected results, you can use this list to pinpoint the problem and make the necessary adjustments.
