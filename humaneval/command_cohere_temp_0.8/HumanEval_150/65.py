This script includes a `is_prime` function that determines whether a given number is prime with a simple algorithm and a `x_or_y` function that returns the value of `x` if the number is prime and `y` otherwise. The unit tests verify correct behavior against various test cases, ensuring the logic matches the problem's requirement. You can use this code to solve the problem and test its validity.  This solution is efficient and uses a optimized algorithm to check for prime which is the `for` loop that checks if the number is divisible from 2 to the square root of the number.  If it's not divisible by any of those numbers then it's a prime number.  Otherwise, it's not a prime number.  This is considered a optimized algorithm for checking if a number is prime or not since it has a time complexity of O(sqrt(N)) where N is the number that is being checked.  This is an efficient algorithm especially for large numbers.  The worst-case complexity for checking if a number is prime or not is O(N^sqrt(441)) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theory.  This is why the code uses the sqrt(N) loop since it's a good trade-off between time complexity and space complexity of the algorithm.  The code is also efficient since it uses the `if ... else` statement to safely check if the variable n is prime without having to iterate or use additional spaces for something like a `is_prime` function and it also uses a break statement to stop the for loop immediately once it finds a number that divides evenly with n which also optimizes the code.  These optimizations are great practices for coding and passing the code with flying colors with an efficient solution.  Hope this explanation helps :)
