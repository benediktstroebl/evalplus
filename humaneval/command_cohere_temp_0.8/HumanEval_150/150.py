# Unit tests
tests = [
    (7, 34, 12, 34),
    (15, 8, 5, 5),
    (18, 9, 13, 13),
    (27, 13, 5, 5),
    (31, 17, 7, 7),
    (40, 5, 10, 10),
    (41, 10, 5, 5)
]

for n, x, y, expected in tests:
    result = x_or_y(n, x, y)
    assert result == expected, f"For inputs {n}, {x} and {y}, expected {expected} but got {result}"
```

This code defines a function `x_or_y` that takes three arguments (`n`, `x`, and `y`) and returns `x` if the integer `n` is prime and `y` if n is not prime. The function checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns `y` as primes do not exist in this range. It also iterates through numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` and checks if any of them is a divisor of `n`, if so, it returns `y`. Otherwise, `n` is a prime and it returns `x`.

The unit tests are defined in the list `tests`, and there is an assertion at the end of the script to check if each test case returns the correct output.
