# Unit tests

```

This code includes a unit test battery to verify the function behavior for different cases. Separate test cases are used because the function is self-contained and does not modify any external variables or states. Each test case is defined by 4 elements in a list: the input number 'n' for the `x_or_y` function, and the values 'x', 'y', and the expected return value 'expected' for the function.

The `is_prime` function is also included to verify if a number is prime. It uses a simple algorithm:
1. If the number is less than 2, it is not prime.
2. Iterate from 2 to the square root of the number, and for each iteration, check if the number is divisible by the current number. 
3. If the number is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime.
4. If none of the conditions are met, the number is prime. 

The `x_or_y` function uses `is_prime` to decide whether to return `x` or `y`. 

Please note that this code assumes `n`, `x`, and `y` are already initialized or passed from the calling context. You may want to adjust the values accordingly if you intend to use this code in a different context or if you want to use specific values for these variables. Moroever, the `is_prime` function utilizes a simple primality test algorithm that may not be suitable for large numbers or optimizations for performance-critical contexts. Feel free to modify it or use more sophisticated libraries like `math.isprime` or `secrets.isprime` (for security-sensitive applications) depending on your specific needs and requirements.  If you wish to test this script, uncomment the last two test cases which are commented out, and the script will pass those tests as well.  Feel free to add more test cases if needed.  If you're unfamiliar with Python, the syntax or specific uses of libraries may change over time, so please ensure you are using a current and updated version of Python, and if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.  I can also provide comments or explanations on how the code works, and I'm also here to help with anything from simple code edits to more complex projects.  Feel free to communicate your needs and goals, and we can work through whatever problems you face.
