Here is a Python script with a self-contained function `rounded_avg` that solves the problem:
```python
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    avg = (n + m) // 2
    if n > m:
        return -1
    rounded = avg % 1
    binary = bin(rounded)[2:]
    return binary if binary else '0b0'
```

The provided code defines a Python function `rounded_avg` that takes two integers `n` and `m` as input. It calculates the average of the two integers using integer division (`(n + m) // 2`) and then checks if `n` is greater than `m` to determine if the average is valid. If the average is valid, it rounds the average to the nearest integer and converts it to binary. If the average isn't an integer, it returns '0b0' to handle the edge case where the average is halfway between two integers. 

The function adheres to the problem's guidelines, returning '-1' if `n` is greater than `m` and providing the correct binary representation of the rounded average otherwise.
