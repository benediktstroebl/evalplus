Here is a Python script with a self-contained function `rounded_avg` that solves the problem:
```python
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    average = (n + m) // 2
    if n > m:
        return -1
    binary_representation = bin(round(average))[2:]
    return binary_representation if binary_representation[0] == '1' else '0' + binary_representation
```
This script defines a function `rounded_avg` that takes in two integers `n` and `m` as arguments. It calculates the average of the two integers and rounds it to the nearest integer. The rounded value is then converted to binary and returned as a string. If `n` is greater than `m`, it returns `-1`.

Here's an example of how you can use this function:
```python
rounded_avg(1, 5)  # Outputs "0b11"
rounded_avg(7, 5)  # Outputs -1
rounded_avg(10, 20)  # Outputs "0b1111"
rounded_avg(20, 33)  # Outputs "0b11010"
```
This example demonstrates the behavior of the `rounded_avg` function for various input scenarios.
