Here is a Python script with a self-contained function `rounded_avg` that solves the problem:
```python
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    bin_str = '-1' if n > m else bin(round((n + m) / 2))[2:]
    return bin_str if bin_str[0] != '1' else bin_str[1:]

# Example usage:
n, m = 1, 5
print(rounded_avg(n, m))  # Output: "0b11"
```

The `rounded_avg` function takes in two integers `n` and `m`, computes the average of the two integers and rounds it to the nearest integer, and then converts the result to binary. The function checks if the first bit of the binary representation is `1`, and if so, removes the `1` to ensure the output conforms to the problem statement's formatting. The example usage demonstrates the function's behavior with the given input.
