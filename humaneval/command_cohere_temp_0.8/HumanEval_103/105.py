Here is a Python script with a self-contained function `rounded_avg` that solves the problem:
```python
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    avg = (n + m) // 2
    if n > m:
        return -1
    return bin(round(avg))[2:]
```
This function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` as parameters and returns the binary representation of the average of the integers between them rounded to the nearest integer if they are in the correct order, or -1 if `n` is greater than `m`. The `round` function is used to round the average to the nearest integer, and `bin` converts the result to binary. Finally, the last two characters `[2:]` are returned to get rid of the '0b' prefix. 

Here is a simple test case to verify the functionality of the script:
```python
print(rounded_avg(1, 5)) # Should print "0b11"
```

This test case should return the expected output of "0b11", as the average of the integers from 1 to 5 rounded to the nearest integer and converted to binary is 11. 

Thus, the provided code snippet performs the necessary computations and returns the correct output as specified in the problem statement.
