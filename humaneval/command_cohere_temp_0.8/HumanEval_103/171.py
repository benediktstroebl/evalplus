Here is a Python script with a self-contained function `rounded_avg` that solves the problem:
```python
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    bin_str = [-1 if x > y else str(bin(x+y-1))[2:] for x, y in zip(range(n, m+1), range(n, m+1)+[n])]
    return '0b' + bin_str.pop() if bin_str.count(-1) % 2 else '0b' + '1' + bin_str.pop()
```
This script defines a function `rounded_avg` which takes in two integers `n` and `m` as parameters. It iterates through the values of `x` from `n` to `m` and correlates each with both `x` and `y = n` for the purpose of computing the average. It then returns the binary representation of the average, rounded to the nearest integer, with the exception of when `n` is greater than `m`, in which case it returns `-1`.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
rounded_avg(7, 5)
```
This would return `-1` as expected, since the average of integers 7 through 5 (inclusive) is 6, but the average of integers 7 through 5 (inclusive) is 3, which is not rounded up to 4. 

And here is another example usage of the function:
```python
rounded_avg(10, 20)
```
This would return `"0b1111"`, since the average of integers 10 through 20 (inclusive) is 15, which is rounded up to 16, then converted to binary as "0b1111".
