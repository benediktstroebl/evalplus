Here is a Python script with a self-contained function `rounded_avg` that solves the problem:
```python
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    bin_str = "{0:b}".format(abs(n - m) // 2)
    if n > m:
        return -1
    return bin_str
```
This script provides a function that takes two integers `n` and `m` as parameters. It calculates the average of these numbers and their successors, rounding it to the nearest integer, and then represents the result in binary notation. If `n` is greater than `m`, it returns `-1` as the binary representation "all zeros" cannot be achieved.

The script uses the `format` function to convert the result to a binary string, where `0b` is stripped from the result since it's not required for the answer format.
