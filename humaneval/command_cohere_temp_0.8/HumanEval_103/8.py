Here is a Python script with a self-contained function `rounded_avg` that solves the problem:
```python
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    if n > m:
        return -1
    sum_ = sum(range(n, m + 1))
    avg = abs(sum_) / (m - n + 1)
    return bin(round(avg))[2:]
```
This function calculates the average of the integers between `n` and `m`, inclusive, and rounds the average to the nearest integer. It then returns the binary representation of the rounded average. If `n` is greater than `m`, it returns -1.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(rounded_avg(1, 5))  # Outputs "0b11"
print(rounded_avg(7, 5))  # Outputs -1
print(rounded_avg(10, 20))  # Outputs "0b1111"
print(rounded_avg(20, 33))  # Outputs "0b11010"
```
This example uses the function with different input pairs and prints the returned binary string.
