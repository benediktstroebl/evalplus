Here's a Python script with a self-contained function `rounded_avg` that solves the problem:
```python
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    if n > m:
        return -1
    total = (n + m) // 2
    count = m - n + 1
    avg = total // count
    return bin(round(avg))[2:]
```

The provided example uses the `round` function to achieve the rounding behavior as described in the prompt, which is consistent with the specification. And the function `bin` is used to convert the result to binary. 

The function handles the case where `n` is greater than `m` by returning -1, as stated in the problem. 
To round the average to the nearest integer, the function leverages Python's built-in `round` function, which is a part of the language's extensive collection of built-in functions that help simplify and concisely accomplish various mathematical and logical operations. 

This approach ensures correctness and robustness while keeping the code concise and readable.
