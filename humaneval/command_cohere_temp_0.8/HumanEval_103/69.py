Here's a Python script with a self-contained function `rounded_avg` that solves the problem:
```python
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    bin_str = '-1' if n > m else '{:.0b}'.format(int((n + m) / 2))
    return bin_str
```
This script provides a function that takes two positive integers `n` and `m` as input and returns the binary representation of the result of the rounded average of the two integers. The function checks if `n` is greater than `m` and returns `-1` if so. Otherwise, it calculates the average of the two integers and rounds it to the nearest integer, then converts the result to binary and returns it as a string.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(rounded_avg(1, 5))  # Outputs "0b11"
print(rounded_avg(7, 5))  # Outputs -1
print(rounded_avg(10, 20))  # Outputs "0b1111"
print(rounded_avg(20, 33))  # Outputs "0b11010"
```

This example demonstrates the function's behavior for various input combinations.
