Here is a Python script with a self-contained function `rounded_avg` that solves the problem:
```python
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    avg = (n + m) // 2
    if n > m:
        return -1
    return bin(round(avg))[2:]
```
This function calculates the average of the integers between `n` and `m`, inclusive. If `n` is greater than `m`, it returns -1. Otherwise, it rounds the average to the nearest integer and converts the result to binary.

The code includes a test suite to ensure correct behavior:
```python
# Test suite
def test_rounded_avg():
    assert rounded_avg(1, 5) == "0b11"
    assert rounded_avg(7, 5) == -1
    assert rounded_avg(10, 20) == "0b1111"
    assert rounded_avg(20, 33) == "0b11010"

test_rounded_avg()
```

To run the test suite, simply include it within the script and execute.
