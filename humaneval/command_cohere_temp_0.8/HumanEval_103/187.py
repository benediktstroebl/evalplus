Here is a Python script with a self-contained function `rounded_avg` that solves the problem:
```python
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    if n > m:
        return -1
    sum_ = sum(range(n, m + 1))
    avg = round(sum_ / (m - n + 1))
    return bin(avg)[2:]
```

The script provides a function that takes in two positive integers `n` and `m` and computes the average of the integers from `n` through `m` (including `n` and `m`). The function then rounds the answer to the nearest integer and converts that result to binary. The function handles the case where `n` is greater than `m` by returning -1.

The script also includes corresponding tests in the code snippet, which are designed to verify the correct behavior of the `rounded_avg` function. You can use these tests to ensure that the function is working correctly and the output is as expected. 

You can execute this code to see the test suite in action and verify the accuracy of the function. 
```python
import unittest

def rounded_avg(n, m):
    if n > m:
        return -1
    sum_ = sum(range(n, m + 1))
    avg = round(sum_ / (m - n + 1))
    return bin(avg)[2:]

class TestRoundedAvg(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_rounded_avg(self):
        self.assertEqual(rounded_avg(1, 5), "0b11")
        self.assertEqual(rounded_avg(7, 5), -1)
        self.assertEqual(rounded_avg(10, 20), "0b1111")
        self.assertEqual(rounded_avg(20, 33), "0b11010")

    def test_exceptions(self):
        self.assertRaises(ValueError, rounded_avg, -1, 5)
        self.assertRaises(ValueError, rounded_avg, 1, -5)
        self.assertRaises(ValueError, rounded_avg, -1, -5)
        self.assertRaises(ValueError, rounded_avg, 10, 20, 30)
