Here's a Python script with a self-contained function `rounded_avg` that solves the problem:
```python
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    if n > m:
        return -1
    total = (n + m) // 2
    count = m - n + 1
    avg = total // count
    return bin(round(avg))[2:]
```

The provided example uses the floor division `(//)` to calculate the average of numbers and the modulo operator `(%)` to find the remainder for rounding. The binary string is extracted using string slicing `(bin(round(avg))[2:])`.
