Here is a Python script with a self-contained function `rounded_avg` that solves the problem:
```python
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    avg = (n + m) // 2
    if n > m:
        return -1
    rounded = avg % 1
    return "-1" if rounded < 0 else f"0b{int(rounded):b}"
```

The provided Python script defines a function `rounded_avg` that takes in two integers `n` and `m` as parameters. It computes the average of the two integers using the formula `(n + m) // 2` and checks if `n` is greater than `m`. If `n` is greater than `m`, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it proceeds to round the average to the nearest integer using the modulo operator (`%`). If the rounded value is negative, it returns `-1`, otherwise, it converts the rounded value to binary and returns it as a string prefixed with "0b". 

The script encapsulates the problem's logic, ensuring it provides the required output for the given inputs, and is readily usable and accessible in other Python programs that may need a function to solve this specific problem.
