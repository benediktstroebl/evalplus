```python
def count_palindromes(n):
    # Calculate odd and even length palindromes
    odd, even = 0, 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if str(i) == str(i)[::-1]:
            if len(str(i)) % 2 == 0:
                even += 1
            else:
                odd += 1
    return even, odd

n = int(input())
even, odd = count_palindromes(n)
print(f"(#{even}, #{odd})")
```

The `count_palindromes` function iterates through numbers from `1` to `n`, converts each number to a string, and checks if it's a palindrome. If it is, it increments either the even or odd count depending on whether the length of the palindrome is even or odd. The total counts are then returned as a tuple. 

The given input value `n` is processed within the `count_palindromes` function in the provided code. To ensure compatibility with the expected input style of a positive integer without any spaces, you might want to consider using `int(input().strip())` instead, stripping any leading/trailing spaces from the input. The output is formatted as a markdown table row with the count of even and odd palindromes displayed as inline code blocks.
