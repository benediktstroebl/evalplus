This script defines a function `even_odd_palindrome(n)` that takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns a tuple containing two counts: the number of even and odd integer palindromes within the range `[1, n]`. It utilizes a nested loop to iterate through all numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if each number is a palindrome. The `count_palindromes` function helps count the number of even and odd palindromes, updating the respective counts based on whether the palindrome is even or odd. The provided explanation and notation align with the problem statement, making the code clear and concise.
