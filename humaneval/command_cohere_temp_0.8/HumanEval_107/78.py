Here's a Python script that includes a self-contained function to solve the problem:
```python
def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    # collect all positive integer palindromes and categorize them based on parity
    count_odd = 0
    count_even = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if str(i) == str(i)[::-1]:
            if i % 2 == 0:
                count_even += 1
            else:
                count_odd += 1
    return (count_even, count_odd)
```
The approach is straightforward. We iterate through all numbers from 1 to n and check if each number is a palindrome. We also keep track of the parities of the palindromes and return the count of even and odd ones.

This script defines the `even_odd_palindrome` function as specified in the prompt and should work correctly for the given input range. Let's assume the test suite has the tests outlined in the `Note` section of the prompt to verify the correctness of the function.
