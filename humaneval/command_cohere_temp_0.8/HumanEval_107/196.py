This script defines a function `even_odd_palindrome(n)` that takes in a positive integer `n` and returns a tuple with the count of even and odd-length integer palindromes within the range `[1, n]` (inclusive). It employs a recursive approach, counting even and odd palindromes using memoization to optimize performance. The script includes test cases to validate its behavior. The expected output is:
```bash
(1, 2)
(4, 6)
```
