Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the problem:
```python
def count_palindromes(n):
    # Count even palindromes
    even = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if str(i) == str(i)[::-1]:
            if i % 2 == 0:
                even += 1
    # Count odd palindromes
    odd = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if str(i) == str(i)[::-1]:
            if i % 2 != 0:
                odd += 1
    return even, odd

def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd
    integer palindromes that fall within the range(1, n), inclusive.
    """
    return count_palindromes(n)

# Test Cases
print(even_odd_palindrome(3))  # Output: (1, 2)
print(even_odd_palindrome(12))  # Output: (4, 6)
```

This script defines a function `even_odd_palindrome(n)` that takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns a tuple containing the count of even and odd integer palindromes within the range `[1, n]`. It uses `count_palindromes(n)` to count the even and odd palindromes and returns them in a tuple. The script includes test cases to help verify its correctness. You can use it as a self-contained Python script to solve the problem.  This solution has a time complexity of `O(n^2)` due to the nested loop structure and palindrome checks.  It has a space complexity of `O(1)` since it does not require any additional data storage apart from the variables used for counting.  You can improve the time complexity to `O(n)` by using a single loop and incrementing counters based on the parities, but the original problem statement doesn't require any optimization.  This version is very concise and easy to understand.
