Here's a Python script that contains a function called `even_odd_palindrome` which takes in a positive integer `n` and returns a tuple with the count of even and odd integer palindromes within the range(1, n+1), the function is further explained below:
```python
def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    even, odd = 0, 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if str(i) == str(i)[::-1]:
            if i % 2 == 0:
                even += 1
            else:
                odd += 1
    return (even, odd)
```
The function initiates two counters, `even` and `odd`, to zero at the start of the iteration. It then iterates through numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if each number is a palindrome. If it is, the function checks if the number is even or odd and increments the respective counter. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the two counters.

This code should solve the problem and pass all the test cases since it is structured to handle positive integers, iterate through all numbers up to `n` while accurately counting the even and odd palindromes, and returning the results as a tuple, such aerospace constraints. 
Let's verify with test cases once you have a proper test suite in place. Do let me know if you'd like to generate test cases or if you have any other follow-up questions.
