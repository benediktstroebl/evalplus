Here's a Python script that contains a function called `even_odd_palindrome` that solves the problem you've described:
```python
def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    even, odd = 0, 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if str(i) == str(i)[::-1]:
            if i % 2 == 0:
                even += 1
            else:
                odd += 1
    return (even, odd)
```

This function iterates through numbers from 1 to `n` and counts the number of palindromes, differentiating between even and odd ones. The result is returned as a tuple.
