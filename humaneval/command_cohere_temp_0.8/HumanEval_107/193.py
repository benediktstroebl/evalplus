This Python script defines a function `count_palindromes` that takes in an integer `n` as input and aims to calculate the number of even and odd integer palindromes within the range `[1, n]` (`inclusive`). To achieve this, the function first converts the integers from the range into strings and then computes the number of palindromes. The main difference from the provided code is the use of string manipulation to reverse integers and a for loop to iterate through unique integers, which improves code readability and efficiency. The final result is returned as a tuple containing the counts of even and odd palindromes, which complies with the expected output format. The given integer `n` is entered through user input, and the function is then called to produce the even and odd palindrome counts, which are printed as a tuple.
