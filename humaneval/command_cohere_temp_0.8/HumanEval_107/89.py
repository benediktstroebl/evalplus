Here's a Python script that contains a function called `even_odd_palindrome` which takes in a positive integer `n` and returns a tuple with the count of even and odd integer palindromes within the range(1, n+1), the function is also accompanied by detailed comments to make it more comprehensible:
```python
def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    """
    This function takes a positive integer n and returns a tuple containing the count of even and odd integer palindromes in the range(1, n+1).
    
    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit for the range of integers to consider.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing two integers representing the count of even and odd palindromes respectively.
    """

    # Ensure that the input is a positive integer.
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Input n should be a positive integer.")

    # Initialize counts for even and odd palindromes.
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0

    # Iterate through the range from 1 to n (inclusive).
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        # Check if the current number is a palindrome.
        if is_palindrome(num):
            # If it is, check if it's even or odd.
            if num % 2 == 0:
                even_count += 1
            else:
                odd_count += 1

    return (even_count, odd_count)


def is_palindrome(number):
    """
    Check if a given number is a palindrome.

    Args:
        number (int): Number to be checked.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the number is a palindrome, False otherwise.
    """
    # Convert the number to a string to simplify the comparison.
    num_str = str(number)
    # Check if the number is equal to its reverse.
    return num_str == num_str[::-1]

# Test cases
print(even_odd_palindrome(3))  # Output: (1, 2)
print(even_odd_palindrome(12))  # Output: (4, 6)
```
This script includes a separate function `is_palindrome` to efficiently check if a given number is a palindrome, it iterates through the numbers from 1 to `n` and keeps track of whether they are even or odd palindromes. The provided test cases output the correct values for the given problem, and the code should smoothly run with Python versions that are widely used. 
The `is_palindrome` function is utilized in this problem, but it's worth mentioning that a more intricate method could be employed to determine a number's palindromic status more effectively.
