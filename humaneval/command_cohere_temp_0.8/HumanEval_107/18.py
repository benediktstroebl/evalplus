```python
def count_palindromes(n):
    # memoization
    memo = {}
    def count_internal(num):
        if num > n:
            return 0, 0
        if num <= 1:
            return 1, 0
        if (num, ) in memo:
            return memo[(num, )]
        odd, even = count_internal(num // 2)
        if num == num[::-1]:
            memo[(num, )] = (even + 1, odd + 1)
        else:
            memo[(num, )] = (even, odd + 1)
        return memo[(num, )]
    return count_internal(n)
```

The code uses a recursive approach with memoization to avoid redundant calculations. The inner function `count_internal` takes a single integer `num` as input and returns the counts of even and odd palindromes in the range `[1, num]`. It checks if `num` is greater than `n`, which would lead to an incorrect result. It also handles base cases where `num` is 0 or 1.

The main logic revolves around the recursive calls to `count_internal`. It calculates the counts for `num // 2` and then accumulates the counts based on whether `num` is a palindrome or not. The result is stored in the `memo` dictionary to avoid recalculations. 

Finally, the function returns the results of `count_internal(n)` which provides the counts of even and odd palindromes in the range `[1, n]`.
