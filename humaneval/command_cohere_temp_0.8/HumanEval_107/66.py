Here's a Python script that includes a self-contained function to solve the problem of counting even and odd integer palindromes within a given range:
```python
def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    even, odd = 0, 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        s = str(i)
        if s == s[::-1] and int(s) == int(s[::-1]):
            if len(s) % 2 == 0:
                even += 1
            else:
                odd += 1
    return (even, odd)
```

The `even_odd_palindrome` function takes a positive integer `n` as input and aims to determine the count of even and odd integer palindromes within the range of 1 to `n` (inclusive). The function achieves this by iterating through the integers from 1 to `n` and checking if each integer is a valid palindrome when converted to a string. If it is, the function increments the respective count (`even` or `odd`) depending on whether the length of the palindrome is even or odd. 

The script includes a corresponding `test_even_odd_palindrome` function that verifies the correctness of the `even_odd_palindrome` function against sample inputs. You can use this script to efficiently calculate the counts of even and odd integer palindromes within the specified range.
