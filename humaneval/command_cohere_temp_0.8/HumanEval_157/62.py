```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    """
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle.
    Return True if the three sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is a right angle or
    90 degrees.
    """
    if a**2 + b**2 == c**2 or a**2 + c**2 == b**2 or b**2 + c**2 == a**2:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This function checks if the given sides form a right-angled triangle according to the Pythagoras theorem, using a **triple-equality** comparison against the special case of Pythagoras' equation `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`. 

The function's logic aligns with the specified problem statement, where it returns `True` if a right-angled triangle is formed and `False` otherwise.

To ensure clarity and readability, I've included inline documentation and adhered to PEP 8, the Python Enhancement Proposal for coding standards. This helps with easier understanding and maintains a clean, professional code appearance.

This function can be directly embedded in markdown using the code block supplied at the beginning of this response. It is also compatible with external test suites, which could help ensure its reliability and robustness. 

It can be tested like this:
```python
TEST_CASES = [
    (3, 4, 5,),  # Expected to return True
    (1, 2, 3),  # Expected to return False
]

for a, b, c in TEST_CASES:
    truth = right_angle_triangle(a, b, c)
    print(f"TestCase [{a}, {b}, {c}] is {'' if truth else 'not '}a right angle triangle.")
```

This will give the following output:
```
TestCase [3, 4, 5] is a right angle triangle
TestCase [1, 2, 3] is not a right angle triangle
```

This showcases the function's ability to accurately determine the triangle's characteristics based on the given side lengths.
