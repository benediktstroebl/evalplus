The given problem is a common algorithm and math problem involving the concept of a right triangle and the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This theorem is generalized and checked in the provided Python script for all combinations of side lengths in a triangle and returns True if any of these conditions are met.

The script tests the function with good test cases like the ones provided in the problem statement as well as more general cases. 

```python
def test_right_angle_triangle():
    assert right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    assert right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    assert right_angle_triangle(5, 12, 13) == True
    assert right_angle_triangle(0, 0, 0) == False
    assert right_angle_triangle(7, 24, 25) == True

test_right_angle_triangle()
```

The assert statements will throw an error if the function returns True or False depending on if the corresponding test case forms a right-angled triangle or not. 

This script provides a clear and concise way to solve the problem and pass the corresponding tests.  It's a good example of how to utilize the Pythagorean theorem to solve real-world problems involving right triangles.
