```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    if a**2 + b**2 == c**2 or a**2 + c**2 == b**2 or b**2 + c**2 == a**2:
        return True
    else: 
        return False
```

This function checks the lengths of the three sides of a triangle using the Pythagorean theorem, ths theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. If the lengths of these sides meet the condition, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`. 

Here is a test suite that can be used to validate the functionality of the code:
```python
def test_right_angle_triangle():
    assert right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    assert right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    assert right_angle_triangle(10, 10, 5) == False
    assert right_angle_triangle(7, 8, 10) == True
```

You can run this test suite to see the `right_angle_triangle` function works as expected.  This approach uses a simple mathematical condition, which helps to reduce code complexity and improve readability, making it easier to understand the purpose of the code at a glance.  This is a key benefit of using conditional statements in Python and other similar languages. 

This code demonstrates a practical application of Python logic and mathematical conditions, making it easier to understand the purpose of the code at a glance. Test driven development (TDD) is a software development process that is often used in Agile development methodologies. The basic idea is to write tests before writing the actual code, which helps to ensure that the code meets the requirements and behaves correctly. In this case, the test suite helps to verify the functionality of the `right_angle_triangle` function and ensures that it behaves as expected.  This approach can help to catch issues early in the development process, improving the overall quality of the code.
