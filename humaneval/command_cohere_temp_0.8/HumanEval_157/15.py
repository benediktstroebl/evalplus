```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    """
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle.
    Return True if the three sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is a right angle or 
    90 degrees.
    """
    if a**2 + b**2 == c**2 or a**2 + c**2 == b**2 or b**2 + c**2 == a**2:
        return True
    else: 
        return False
```
The above right_angle_triangle() function checks ascientifica's posting about the topic and implements the logic. 

The following is a test suite that can be used to validate the correctness of the implementation:
```python
# Test Case for True Output
assert right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
assert right_angle_triangle(5, 12, 13) == True

# Test Case for False Output
assert right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
assert right_angle_triangle(10, 2, 5) == False
```
To test the functionality, three test cases are included: one for a True result and two for False results. 

This code snippet can be installed as a module and imported for use in other Python scripts. Alternatively, it may be run directly as a script in the Python environment. 

To sum up, the code provides a self-contained solution to the problem in the given Python script, with a function that accurately determines whether a triangle has a right angle or not.
