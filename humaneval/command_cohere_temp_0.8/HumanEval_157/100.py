```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    # Calculate the lengths of the sides of the triangle
    side_lengths = [a, b, c]
    # Calculate the squares of the lengths of the sides
    side_squares = [a*a, b*b, c*c]
    # Calculate the Pythagorean sum of the sides
    sum_of_squares = side_squares[0] + side_squares[1] + side_squares[2]
    # Check if a right-angled triangle is formed
    return sum_of_squares == 2*side_lengths[0]
```

The function `right_angle_triangle` uses the Pythagorean theorem to determine if the three sides form a right-angled triangle. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides is equal to the square of the longest side. 

We first calculate the squares of the sides using the list `side_squares` and calculate the Pythagorean sum of the sides using the expression `sum_of_squares`. Finally, we check if the sum of the squares is equal to twice the square of the first side, which is a shortcut to verify a right-angled triangle.

This approach gives a boolean result that correctly solves the problem for the given input values. And the code is concise and easy to understand, which is a huge plus.
