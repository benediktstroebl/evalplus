```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    # Calculate the lengths of the sides of the triangle
    side_lengths = [a, b, c]
    # Calculate the square of each length
    squares = [a**2, b**2, c**2]
    # Calculate the cross product
    cross = squares[0] * squares[1] - squares[2] * sides[1] * sides[2]
    # Determine if the triangle is right-angled
    if cross > 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

The function assesses the relationship between the sides and the squares of the sides to determine if it forms a right-angled triangle. 

This approach follows the logic of the Pythagorean theorem, where the square of the longest side of a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the two other sides. 

It returns True if the triangle is right-angled and False otherwise.

To use this code, you can copy and paste it into a Python environment or script, and then you can call the `right_angle_triangle` function with the appropriate arguments to determine if a given set of side lengths forms a right-angled triangle. 

This approach should help tackle the problem statement in a self-contained manner.
