```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    # Calculate the lengths of the two sides of the triangle's right angle
    s = (a ** 2 + b ** 2) ** 0.5
    t = (b ** 2 + c ** 2) ** 0.5

    # Check if the lengths form a right-angled triangle
    return s == t or s == c or t == a
```

The function `right_angle_triangle` determines the lengths of the two sides of the right angle in the given triangle, using the Pythagorean theorem. Then it checks whether these sides are equal to the other two sides of the triangle. It returns 'True' if any of these conditions are met, indicating that the three sides form a right-angled triangle. Otherwise, it returns 'False'.

This approach gives an optimized solution to the problem, avoiding redundant calculations and leading to more efficient execution, especially important when dealing with large values or in a practical scenario. 

This code can be used as a base for more advanced solutions involving more complex conditions or optimizations, and it can also be adapted to handle other triangle-related problems.
