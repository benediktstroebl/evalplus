```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    if a**2 + b**2 == c**2 or a**2 + c**2 == b**2 or b**2 + c**2 == a**2:
        return True
    else: 
        return False
```

This function checks the Pythagorean equality constraints required to identify a right-angled triangle. It returns True if any of these conditions are met, and False otherwise. To ensure correctness, this function leverages the principle that the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides of a right-angled triangle is equal to the square of the longest side. 

To use this code, you can copy and paste it into a Python environment or script and invoke the `right_angle_triangle` function with the appropriate arguments to determine if a given set of side lengths forms a right-angled triangle.

This approach ensures that the function is self-contained and does not rely on external resources or modules. It provides a standalone solution to the problem and can be easily incorporated into other projects or used for testing.
