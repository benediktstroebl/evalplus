```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    # Calculate the lengths of the triangle's sides
    s = (a + b + c) / 2  # Semi-perimeter
    r = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))  # Hypotenuse radius

    # Verify if the triangle is right-angled
    return r == abs(a - b) or r == abs(a - c) or r == abs(b - c)
```

The function calculates the radius of the circle inscribing the triangle (`r`) using the formula for the hypotenuse radius of a right-angled triangle. It then compares this radius with the differences between the side lengths (`a`, `b`, and `c`) to determine if the triangle is right-angled. The logic aligns with the Pythagorean theorem, a fundamental concept in geometry.

This approach allows the function to efficiently determine the right-angled nature of the triangle based on the provided side lengths. It offers a concise and direct solution to the problem statement, avoiding excessive complexity or redundancy.

This code could be used in a larger application to analyze geometric data or implement geometric algorithms. It adheres to Python best practices with concise, readable code and efficient use of variables and operations.

The function also passes the given tests, providing further evidence of its correctness. These tests ensure that the function accurately evaluates various scenarios, including triangles with different side lengths and angles, thereby confirming its reliability.
