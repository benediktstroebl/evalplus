```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    """
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle.
    Return True if the three sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is a right angle or
    90 degrees.
    """
    if a**2 + b**2 = c**2 or a**2 + c**2 = b**2 or b**2 + c**2 = a**2:
        return True
    else: 
        return False
```

This function checks if the given sides of the triangle form a right-angled triangle according to the Pythagorean theorem,  `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`. If any of these conditions are met, the function returns True, and False otherwise. 

To follow the prompt, this script also has inline documentation and an example use case that can be easily modified. 

This function can be easily adapted for use in educational contexts, teaching Python and related mathematical concepts. It may be useful to include instructions on how to apply the function and explain the underlying mathematical principles to make it accessible to a broad audience.
