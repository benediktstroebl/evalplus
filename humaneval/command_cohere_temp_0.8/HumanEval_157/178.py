```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    # Calculate the lengths of the triangle's sides
    s = (a + b + c) / 2  # Semi-perimeter
    h = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))  # Height

    # Check if the triangle is right-angled using the Pythagorean theorem
    return h == b or h == c or h == a
```

This function calculates the height `h` using the formula for the hypotenuse of a right triangle (Pythagorean theorem), where `s` is the semi-perimeter of the triangle. It then compares the calculated height to each side length (`a`, `b`, and `c`) to determine if the triangle is right-angled. The unit tests will check for correct behavior against the given examples and edge cases. 
The test cases ensure various scenarios are correctly identified as right-angled or not, helping enhance accuracy and handle potential bugs. You can add these test cases to complete the implementation.
