```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    # Calculate the length of the hypotenuse
    hypotenuse = (a ** 2 + b ** 2) ** 0.5

    # Check if the lengths form a right-angled triangle
    return hypotenuse == c and hypotenuse ** 2 == a ** 2 + b ** 2
```

The function `right_angle_triangle` leverages the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the length of the hypotenuse and then compares it to the provided third side. It also ensures that the hypotenuse is the sum of the squares of the other two sides, which are orthogonal. This approach allows for a determination of whether the given sides can form a right-angled triangle, consistent with the problem statement. 

This approach checks both conditions mentioned in the problem statement, giving a True result for valid right-angle triangles. Meanwhile, any input that doesn't meet both conditions will result in a False, catching a variety of invalid cases. For example:
```python
print(right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5))  # True
print(right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3))  # False
``` 

One suggestion to enhance the function further, consider implementing input validation to check if any of the sides is less than zero. This wouldn't affect the functionality but would provide more comprehensive feedback to the user, as below: 
```python
print(right_angle_triangle(-3, 4, 5))  # ValueError: Input sides must not be less than zero.
```
