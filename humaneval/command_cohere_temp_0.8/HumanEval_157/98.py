```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    # Calculate the length of the hypotenuse
    hypotenuse = (a**2 + b**2)**0.5
    
    # Check if the lengths form a right-angled triangle
    return hypotenuse == c and hypotenuse * hypotenuse == a**2 + b**2
```

The function checks if the triangle formed by a, b, and c is a right triangle. It calculates the length of the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem and then compares it to the provided length c. It also checks if the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. If both conditions are met, it returns True, indicating a right triangle; otherwise, it returns False. 

To follow the prompt, the function includes a docstring that describes the behavior of the function and provides example queries.

To asses the function's behavior against edge cases, consider adding tests to a test suite, such as:
```python
def test_right_angle_triangle():
    # Tests
    assert right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    assert right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    assert right_angle_triangle(10, 10, 1) == False
    assert right_angle_triangle(0, 0, 0) == False
    assert right_angle_triangle(7, 24, 25) == True
```

This test suite covers different cases, including a valid right triangle, two invalid triangles, and a triangle with an invalid angle. 
```python
test_right_angle_triangle()
```
