```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    total = a + b + c
    if total == 180:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This function evaluates the sum of the three given sides of the triangle against the sum of the angles of a triangle (180 degrees) to determine if the triangle represents a right angle. 

Here are some example calls to this function:
```python
# These should return True
right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5)
right_angle_triangle(5, 12, 13)
right_angle_triangle(7, 24, 25)

# These should return False
right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)
right_angle_triangle(0, 1, 2)
right_angle_triangle(10, 5, 15)
```

This script will return the correct value for whether a given triangle represents a right angle.
