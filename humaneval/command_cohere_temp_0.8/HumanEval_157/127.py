```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    # Calculate the length of the hypotenuse
    hypotenuse = (a ** 2 + b ** 2) ** 0.5
    
    # Check if the triangle is right-angled
    if hypotenuse == c or hypotenuse == abs(a - c) or hypotenuse == abs(b - c):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

The function `right_angle_triangle` leverages the Pythagoras theorem to calculate the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle. Subsequently, it compares the calculated hypotenuse against the remaining two side lengths. The function returns 'True' if any of these comparisons match, rightly indicating a right-angled triangle. If none of these conditions are met, the function returns 'False', signifying no right angle. This approach allows the function to accurately determine whether the given sides form a right-angled triangle. 

This logic can be extended to other scenarios to optimize the checks. For example, we don't need to calculate the hypotenuse again when checking the differences between the sides as these differences are already accounted for in the equation. This subtle optimization can improve the performance and accuracy, especially when dealing with larger side lengths. 

To test this function, you can call it with different side lengths and verify the returned results:
```python
# Test example 1
test_case_1 = right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5)
print(test_case_1)  # Output: True

# Test example 2
test_case_2 = right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)
print(test_case_2)  # Output: False
```

This provides an accurate, efficient way to verify whether the sides form a right-angled triangle without enumerating all possible cases.
