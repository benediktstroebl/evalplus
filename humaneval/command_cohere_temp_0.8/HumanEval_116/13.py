```python
def sort_array(arr):
    arr.sort(key=lambda x: (-bin(x).count('1'), x))
    return arr
```

The `key` argument in the `sort` function is used to specify a function that defines the sort order. In this case, the function `lambda x: (-bin(x).count('1'), x)` returns a tuple where the first element is the number of ones in the binary representation of the number, and the second element is the decimal value of the number. The numbers are sorted in ascending order based on the number of ones in their binary representation. If the number of ones is the same, they are sorted based on their decimal value.
