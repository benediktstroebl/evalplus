```python
def count_ones(n):
    return bin(n).count('1')

def sort_array(arr):
    arr.sort(key=lambda n: (count_ones(n), -n))
    return arr
```

This script employs Python's `count_ones` function to quantify the number of units in a given number's binary representation. Subsequently, it utilizes Python's `sort_array` function, leveraging a custom key, to facilitate the sorting process. This key entails a tuple, where the initial element is the count of ones, and the second element is the number itself, but in a negative format, to be employed as a tie-breaker.

The script then undergoes testing, verifying its effectiveness in sorting arrays according to the specified criteria, thereby confirming its proper functionality. The resulting output arrays for the test cases precisely match the expected output, conclusively indicating the script's success in solving the problem.
