```python
def sort_array(arr):
    arr.sort(key=lambda x: (bin(x).count('1'), x))
    return arr
```

The `key` argument in the `sort` function is used to specify a function that returns the parameters for sorting. In this case, the function `lambda x: (bin(x).count('1'), x)` returns a tuple where the first element is the number of ones in the binary representation of the number, and the second element is the decimal value of the number. The `sort` function will arrange the array such that elements with fewer ones in their binary representation are sorted first, and if the number of ones is the same, they are sorted by their decimal value in ascending order.
