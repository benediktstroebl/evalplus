```python
def sort_array(arr):
    arr.sort(key=lambda x: (-bin(x).count('1'), x))
    return arr
```

The `key` argument in the `sort` function is used to specify a function that returns the arguments passed to the sorting function as a tuple. In this case, the lambda function `(-bin(x).count('1'), x)` achieves the desired effect of sorting the array first by the number of ones in the binary representation of each element, and in the case of a tie, sorting by the decimal value of the elements. The binary representations are counted for the ones using `bin(x).count('1')`, which returns a string containing a binary representation of the integer `x`, and the count is negated to ensure natural sorting in descending order.
