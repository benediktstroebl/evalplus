```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    arr = [i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n+1)]
    
    # Calculate occurrences 3 in arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k]
    occur = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            for k in range(j+1, n):
                if (arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k]) % 3 == 0:
                    occur += 1
    
    return occur
```

The script uses a list comprehension to generate the array `arr` of numbers as described in the problem statement. It then creates three nested loops to iterate over the list and checks if the sum of any three elements is a multiple of 3. The output is the number of such triples. 

To ensure correctness and edge case coverage, it is essential to thoroughly test the function with various input sizes and validate that the expected output matches the problem statement. Test cases can be created to cover different scenarios, including smaller and larger input sizes and validate the expected behavior.  This ensures that the function is not just correct but also robust and efficient in handling various inputs.
