```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    arr = [i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    triples = 0
    for i in range(n - 2):
        for j in range(i + 1, n - 1):
            if (arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[j + 1]) % 3 == 0:
                triples += 1
    return triples
```

The code defines a function `get_max_triples` which takes in a positive integer `n` and returns the number of triples from the list `arr` where `a[i] + a[j] + a[k]` is a multiple of 3. It first creates an array `arr` of length `n` with values equal to `i * i - i + 1` for all `i`. The code then iterates through all triples of elements in the list, and counts the number of triples where the sum is a multiple of 3. This value is then returned. 

To better understand the implementation, let's break down the logic into steps:
1. We first create an array `arr` composed of `n` elements, where each element `i` corresponds to `i * i - i + 1`. This is the core logic of generating the array as described in the prompt.
2. Next, we will be iterating through all pairs of elements in the array to count valid triples. Specifically, we will be using two indices `i` and `j` that iterates through all pairs where `i` is less than `j`. 
3. For each pair of elements `(arr[i], arr[j])`, we need to consider whether the third element `arr[j + 1]` would make the sum a multiple of 3. If so, we increment the count by 1. We do this by using a separate counter and checking if `arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[j + 1]` is divisible by 3.
4. After counting all valid triples for a certain pair `(arr[i], arr[j])`, we then move on to consider all possible pairs of elements in the array by moving the index `i` ahead by 1. We continue this process until `i` is less than `n - 2`, as we are limited to considering only three elements in the array for the purpose of this problem. 

Overall, the code provides an efficient solution by directly solving the problem without any recursive or dynamic programming approaches.
