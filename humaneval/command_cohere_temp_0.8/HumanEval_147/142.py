```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    arr = [i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n+1)]
    
    # Calculate the maximum number of triples where a[i] + a[j] + a[k] is a multiple of 3.
    # We count for each a[i] the number of corresponding valid pairs (j, k)
    cache = [0] * (n + 1)
    for j in range(1, n):
        for k in range(j + 1, n):
            if (arr[j] + arr[k]) % 3 == 0:
                cache[j] += 1
    
    # The answer is the sum of valid pairs for a[1..n]
    return sum(cache) - cache[0]
```

The solution is based on calculating the `cache` array, which contains the number of `valid pairs` for each a[i] value.  A `valid pair` is a pair (j, k) where `arr[j] + arr[k] % 3 == 0` and `j < k`. Then the solution returns the sum of valid pairs for a[1..n] minus the number of valid pairs for a[0] since a[0] is not included in any valid triple.
