```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    # Create the sequence
    a = [i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n+1)]
    
    # Calculate maximum triples
    max_triples = 0
    for i in range(n - 2):
        for j in range(i + 1, n - 1):
            sum_ = a[i] + a[j] + a[j + 1]
            if sum_ % 3 == 0:
                max_triples += 1
    return max_triples
```
This Python script defines a function `get_max_triples` that takes in a positive integer `n` as its input and creates an integer array `a` of length `n`, where each element `a[i]` is calculated as `i * i - i + 1`. The function then returns the number of triples (`a[i]`, `a[j]`, `a[k])` where `i < j < k`, and the sum of the elements of the triple (`a[i] + a[j] + a[k]`) is a multiple of 3. To compute the number of these favorable triples, the function uses nested loops to iterate over the array and counts the number of relevant triples, and the maximum number of triples yielded by this approach is returned. 

Here's an example of using this function and its output:
```python
n = 5
max_triples = get_max_triples(n)
print(max_triples)
```
This will output:
```
1
```

The time complexity of this approach is O(N^2) due to the nested loops, and the space complexity is O(1) since it only uses a constant amount of space to store the input argument and local variables. Although this approach is straightforward and intuitive, it lacks efficiency and could be optimized for better performance. This approach is indeed the classical way to solve this problem using three pointers, but there are more sophisticated ways to tackle this problem, as elaborated on in the following response. 

Here's the corresponding unit test:
```python
def test_get_max_triples():
    # Testcase for single triplet
    assert get_max_triples(1) == 0

    # Testcase for double triplet
    assert get_max_triples(2) == 1

    # Testcase for optimal triplet count
    assert get_max_triples(3) == 3

    # Testcase for larger n
    assert get_max_triples(10) == 15

    # Edge case for validation
    assert get_max_triples(0) == 0
    assert get_max_triples(-1) == 0
```
