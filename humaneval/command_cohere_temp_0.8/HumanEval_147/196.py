```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    arr = [i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n+1)]
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n-2):
        for j in range(i+1, n-1):
            if arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[j+1] >= 0 and arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[j+1] % 3 == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```
The code defines a Python function `get_max_triples` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of triples (a[i], a[j], a[k]) from an array `a` where `i < j < k` and `a[i] + a[j] + a[k]` is a multiple of 3. The function creates an array `arr` of length `n` where each element is calculated as `i * i - i + 1` (the task's description). It then iterates through the array and checks if `a[i] + a[j] + a[k]` is a multiple of 3 and is a valid triple. The inner loop runs ahead one step so it can account for combinations like (`1`, `4`, `7`) and (`4`, `7`, `1`) as one valid triple. The count is then returned. 

The solution's time complexity is O(N^2) due to the nested loop structure, which is necessary to count valid triples. The space complexity is O(N) as it creates an array of size N.
