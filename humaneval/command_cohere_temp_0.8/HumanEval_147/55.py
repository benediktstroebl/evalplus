```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    arr = [i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    triples = 0
    for i in range(n - 2):
        for j in range(i + 1, n - 1):
            if (arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[j + 1]) % 3 == 0:
                triples += 1
    return triples
```

The solution leverages nested loops to iterate through all valid triples (where the sum is divisible by 3). To improve efficiency, the outer loop skips the last index (since it's not possible to have a valid triple with only one element). This optimized approach ensures that the number of valid triples is calculated correctly.
