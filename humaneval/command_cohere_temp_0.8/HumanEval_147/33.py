```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    arr = [i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n+1)]
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n-2):
        for j in range(i+1, n-1):
            if (arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[j+1]) % 3 == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```
The Python script provided solves the problem by generating an array of integers as per the problem statement. It then counts the number of unique triples in this array where the sum of the three numbers is divisible by three. This is done using two nested loops, and the @fixed-size container is updated whenever a valid triplet is encountered. The final count of valid triples is returned as the output of the function. 
This code is efficient and has a time complexity of O(N^2), where N is the size of the array and has a space complexity of O(N). It is self-contained, meaning it does not rely on external variables or functions, making it easier to understand and transfer to other projects as needed. GPT-4] 
Please let me know if you would like me to explain any part of the code in detail, or provide any further insights.
