```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    arr = [i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n+1)]
    
    # Calculate max triples where a[i] + a[j] + a[k] is a multiple of 3
    # By observing that the necessary conditions are:
    # - The sum of two values (a[i] and a[j]) is a multiple of 3
    # - The difference between the two values is also a multiple of 3
    # We can derive the maximum number of valid triples for each a[i]
    max_triples = [sum([1 for i in range(n) if (arr[i] - arr[j]) % 3 == 0 and (arr[i] + arr[j]) % 3 == 0]) for j in range(n)]
    return max(max_triples)
```
This approach efficiently solves the problem by directly analyzing the necessary conditions for valid triples, eliminating the need for explicit triple traversal and counting. The function returns the maximum number of triples satisfying the given conditions in the integer array `a` of length `n`.
