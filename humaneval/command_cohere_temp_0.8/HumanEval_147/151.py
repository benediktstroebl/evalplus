```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    arr = [i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n+1)]
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n-2):
        for j in range(i+1, n-1):
            if (arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[j+1]) % 3 == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```
The code defines a Python function get_max_triples that takes an integer n as input. This function creates an array a of length n, where each element a[i] is computed as i*i-i+1. It calculates the number of unique triples (a[i], a[j], a[k]) where i < j < k and the sum of these three array elements is divisible by 3. It achieves this by iterating through all pairs of elements in the array and checking if their sum is divisible by 3. The overall time complexity is O(N^2), and the space complexity is O(N) as it creates an array of size N.
