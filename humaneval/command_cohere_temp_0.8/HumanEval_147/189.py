```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    # Create the sequence
    a = [i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n+1)]
    
    # Calculate max triples
    triples = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            curr = a[i] + a[j]
            if curr % 3 == 0:
                triples += 1
    return triples
```

The solution is based on generating the array `a` as required in the prompt, and then iterating through all triples of elements from `a`, checking if their sum is a multiple of 3. The function returns the maximum number of triples found.

To better explain the approach, let's break down the code:
1. The nested loop is used to iterate through all possible pairs of elements `a[i]` and `a[j]` where `i < j`. This allows us to examine each pair's sum and check if it's a multiple of 3.
2. Within the nested loop, the sum of `a[i]` and `a[j]` is calculated and stored in the variable `curr`.
3. The condition `curr % 3 == 0` checks if the sum is divisible by 3. If this condition is met, it means that the pair `(a[i], a[j])` forms part of a triple that satisfies the problem's condition.
4. Whenever a valid pair `(a[i], a[j])` is found, it contributes to the count of triples that satisfy the condition, so `triples` is incremented.
5. The function returns the final count of triples found, which represents the maximum number of valid triples in the array `a`.
