```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    arr = [i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n+1)]
    triples = 0
    for i in range(n-2):
        for j in range(i+1, n-1):
            if (arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[j+1]) % 3 == 0:
                triples += 1
    return triples
```
The code defines a Python function `get_max_triples` that takes an integer `n` as input. It aims to create an array `a` where each element `a[i]` is computed as `i * i - i + 1`. The problem asks to return the number of triples (a[i], a[j], a[k]) where `i < j < k`, and `a[i] + a[j] + a[k]` is a multiple of 3.

The function creates the array `arr` of length `n` with the specified elements. It then calculates the number of triples that satisfy the condition and returns their count. To do this, it uses two nested loops to pair elements that are closer in the array, and it checks if their sum is divisible by 3.

The time complexity of this code is O(N^2) due to the nested loops traversing the array, and the space complexity is O(N) as it creates an additional list `arr`.
