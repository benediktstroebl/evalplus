```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    arr = [i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n - 2):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if (arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[j + 1]) % 3 == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```
The code defines a Python function `get_max_triples` that takes an integer `n` as input. This function calculates the integer array `arr` of length `n`, where each element `a[i]` is calculated as `i * i - i + 1` for all `i` from 1 to `n`. It then iterates through the array and counts the number of distinct triples `(a[i], a[j], a[k])` where `i < j < k` and the sum of the three array elements is divisible by 3. The function returns the count of these qualifying triples. 

The time complexity of the code is O(n^2) due to the nested loop structure, and the space complexity is O(n) to store the array `arr`.
