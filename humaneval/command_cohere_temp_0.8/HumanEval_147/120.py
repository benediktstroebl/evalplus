```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    arr = [i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n+1)]
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n-2):
        for j in range(i+1, n-1):
            if arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[j+1] == 3:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```
This Python script defines a function called `get_max_triples` that takes in a positive integer n as its input. This function creates an integer array `a` of length n, where each element `a[i]` is calculated as `i * i - i + 1`. The goal is to count the number of unique triples (a[i], a[j], a[k]) where `i < j < k` and the sum of these three array elements is divisible by 3. This script then proceeds to iterate through the array `arr` and counts the number of valid triples that satisfy these conditions, and the result is returned as the output of the function. 

This code should be self-contained and capable of being executed as-is to achieve the desired result.
