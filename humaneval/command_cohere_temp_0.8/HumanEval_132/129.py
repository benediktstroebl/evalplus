```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[':
            open += 1
        elif char == ']':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open != closed
```

The function counts the open and closed brackets accordingly while traversing through the given string. Once it finishes checking, it compares the counts of open and closed brackets. If they are not equal, there exists a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested. 

The provided example test cases demonstrate the functionality of the implemented solution.
