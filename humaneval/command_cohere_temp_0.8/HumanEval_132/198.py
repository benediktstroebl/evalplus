```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == ']':
            closed += 1
            open -= 1
        else:
            open += 1
    return closed > open
```

The code defines a function `is_nested()` that takes a string as an input and checks whether the number of closed brackets is greater than or equal to the number of open brackets. It returns `True` if there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(is_nested('[]'))  # Output: False
print(is_nested('([])'))  # Output: True
print(is_nested('[[[[[['))  # Output: True
``` 

The provided examples demonstrate how the function works.
