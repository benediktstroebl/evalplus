```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[' :
            open += 1
        elif char == ']':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False 
    return open != 0
```

The script uses a simple `sliding window` approach, where `open` and `close` counters are used to track the occurrences of opening and closing brackets respectively. The algorithm iterates through the string, incrementing the appropriate counter every time an opening or closing bracket is encountered.

The key insight is that a valid bracket sequence necessarily has at least one nested bracket. So, the algorithm returns `True` if the `open` counter is nonzero at the end, indicating the presence of at least one nested bracket. And it returns `False` otherwise. This means the simplest valid bracket sequence `[[[]]]` will return True because of the nested bracket sequence `[]` within. And any string with a single unbalanced bracket, such as `[](`, `{}`, or `())`, will return False since there is no valid subsequence with nested brackets.
