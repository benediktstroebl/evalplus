```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[' :
            open += 1
        elif char == ']' :
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open != closed
```

The function counts the open and closed brackets until now it encounters a closing bracket ']'. If at any point the number of open brackets exceeds the number of closed brackets, the function returns `False` since there is no valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested. Otherwise, return `True` since at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested.

Let's break down the code:
1. `def is_nested(s):` declares a new function called `is_nested` that takes a single argument `s`, which is the string containing only square brackets that we want to analyze.
2. `open, closed = 0, 0` initializes two variables `open` and `closed` to keep track of the count of opening and closing brackets respectively. They are both initialized to 0.
3. `for char in s:` iterates through each character in the input string `s`.
4. `if char == '[':` if the current character is an opening bracket '[', it increments the `open` counter by 1.
5. `elif char == ']':` if the current character is a closing bracket ']', it increments the `closed` counter by 1.
6. `if open > closed:` checks if at any point the number of open brackets is greater than the number of closed brackets. If this condition is met, it returns `False` since there is no valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested.
7. `return open != closed:` if the code reaches the end of the loop, it means there are equal numbers of opening and closing brackets, and at least one bracket must be nested in the valid subsequence of brackets. So, it returns `True` in this case.

This function can be used to efficiently solve the problem as shown in the given test cases.
