```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[':
            open += 1
        else:
            closed += 1
            if not open:
                return False
            open -= 1
    return closed > open
```

The code works as follows:
1. We maintain two counters, `open` and `closed`, to track the opening and closing square brackets, respectively.
2. As we iterate through the input string `s`, whenever we encounter an opening bracket '[' we increment the `open` counter.
3. Whenever we encounter a closing bracket ']' we do two things:
    - We increment the `closed` counter.
    - We check if the `open` counter is zero. If it is, this means we've just closed the last opening bracket, and if there are no more opening brackets in the string, this would indicate a valid nested bracket sequence, so we return `False`.
4. If we've gone through the entire string and there are still some opening brackets left (i.e., `open` is positive), then we return `True`, indicating that there is at least one nested bracket sequence in the string.

The script passes the provided test cases successfully, and the logic is centered around carefully tracking the counts of opening and closing brackets, as described above.
