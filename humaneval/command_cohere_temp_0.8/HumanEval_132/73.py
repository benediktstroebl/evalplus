```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[':
            open += 1
        else:
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open != close
```

The function counts the opening and closing square brackets using two counters `open` and `close`. With each character read, the respective counter is increased or decreased. Once the function has reached the end of the string, the values of `open` and `close` are checked; if they differ, there is a valid nested bracket sequence and the function returns `True`. If both values are equal, no nested sequence was found, and the function returns `False`. 

Note: this implementation has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), where n is the number of characters in the string `s`. It is also worth noting that the code is deterministic and will not change between runs, as the algorithm is purely based on the provided input.
