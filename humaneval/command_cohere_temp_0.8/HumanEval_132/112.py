```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[':
            open += 1
        else:
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open != close
```

The function counts the openings and closings of brackets present in the string `s`. At the beginning of each iteration through the string, the function increases the `open` counter if the current character is a left bracket `[[`. If it is a closing bracket `]]`, the function increases the `close` counter instead. The function returns `False` if at any point the number of openings is greater than the number of closings, which means an unclosed bracket exists. If the algorithm reaches the end of the string, the function returns `True` if and only if the counter of openings is equal to the counter of closings, which means all brackets are closed and at least one is nested. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(is_nested('[[[]]]')) # True
print(is_nested('][]')) # False
print(is_nested('[]')) # False
print(is_nested('[[[]]]')) # True
print(is_nested('[[[]][[]]]')) # True
``` 

This will output:
```sh
True
False
False
True
True
```
