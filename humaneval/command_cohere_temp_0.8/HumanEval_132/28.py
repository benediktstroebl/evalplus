```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[':
            open += 1
        elif char == ']':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open != close
```

The function counts the opening and closing brackets `[` and `]` as it iterates over the input string. The algorithm returns `False` immediately if there's a imbalance between open and closed brackets. If there's no imbalance, and the algorithm reaches the end of the string, it checks if there's any nesting by verifying that the number of open brackets is not equal to the number of closed brackets (open != close). If this condition is true, then the algorithm returns `True`. 

This algorithm is encapsulated in a self-contained Python function that solves the specified problem. It can be easily dropped into a Python environment or script to test against other strings. 

Note: this approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of characters in the string, and a space complexity of O(1).
