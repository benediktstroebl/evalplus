```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[':
            open += 1
        elif char == ']':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open != closed
```

The function counts the open and closed brackets until it reaches the end of the string. If at any point the number of open brackets is greater than the number of closed brackets, the function returns False, otherwise, it returns True. The additional logic to count the brackets is necessary to ensure that the problem statement's conditions are met, e.g. the existence of a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested.
