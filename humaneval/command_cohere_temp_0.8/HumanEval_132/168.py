```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == ']':
            closed += 1
        else:
            open += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open != closed
```

The function counts the open and closed brackets incrementally, and test if the total open brackets are not equal to the total closed brackets at the end. The function returns `True` if there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested, and `False` otherwise.
