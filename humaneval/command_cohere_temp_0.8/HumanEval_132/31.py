```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[':
            open += 1
        else:
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open != close
```

The function counts the openings '[' and closings ']' as it iterates through the string. The valid sequences of brackets the code is looking for may form a pyramid-like structure where each level has fewer openings than closings, with at least one level having more openings than closings. The base case of the recursion is when the closings are longer at every step, in which case it returns False as there are no possibilities for valid sequences. Otherwise, it returns True, indicating at least one valid bracket sequence.
