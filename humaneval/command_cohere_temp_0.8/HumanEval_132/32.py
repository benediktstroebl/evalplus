```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[' :
            open += 1
        elif char == ']':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False 
    return open != 0
```

The code works as follows:
1. We initialize two counters, `open` and `close`, to track the opening and closing brackets respectively.
2. We iterate through each character in the input string `s`.
3. If the character is `'['` (opening bracket), we increment the `open` counter. This signifies that we've encountered an opening bracket, and we're "opening" an interval.
4. If the character is `']'` (closing bracket), we increment the `close` counter. This signifies that we've encountered a closing bracket, and we're "closing" an interval.
5. The algorithm keeps track of the overall balance of brackets through the interaction of the `open` and `close` counters. A closing bracket only matches an opening one if they are paired and nested within each other. 
6. If at any point the `open` counter is greater than the `close` counter, it means there are unmatched opening brackets. In this case, we return `False` since there is no valid subsequence of brackets with at least one nested bracket.
7. If the statement is true, this indicates that all opening brackets have been matched by closing brackets, and there might be a valid nested bracket sequence. In this case, we return `True`.

The script will return `True` for inputs such as `'[[][]]'` and `'[[]][['`, but will return `False` for inputs like `'[]']]` and `'[][]`".
