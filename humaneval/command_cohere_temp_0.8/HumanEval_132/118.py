```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == ']':
            closed += 1
        else:
            open += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open == closed
```

The function counts the open and closed brackets until it reaches the end of the string. It constantly checks if the number of closed brackets is greater or equal to the number of open brackets, if it is, the function returns False, if the opposite is true, the function returns True. In case the number of open brackets is greater at the end, then there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested.

### Here are examples of function calls and their corresponding outputs:
```python
print(is_nested('[]'))  # Output: False
print(is_nested('[][]'))  # Output: False
print(is_nested('([])'))  # Output: True
print(is_nested(')[])'))  # Output: True
print(is_nested('[])'))  # Output: False
print(is_nested('[]'))  # Output: False
print(is_nested('[[[[[[[[['))  # Output: False
```
