```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == ']':
            closed += 1
        else:
            open += 1
        if closed > open:
            return False
    return not open
```

The function counts the open and closed brackets incrementally as it iterates over the string. It determines whether the string has a nested bracket sequence by checking if the number of closed brackets exceeds the number of open brackets at any point. If there are no open brackets left at the end of the string, it returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False.`

Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:
1. The `def is_nested(s):` line defines a function called `is_nested` that takes a single argument `s`, which is the string to be checked for nested brackets.
2. The `open, closed = 0, 0` line initializes two variables, `open`, and `closed`, to zero, which will be used to keep track of the number of opening and closing brackets encountered.
3. The `for char in s:` line starts a loop that iterates through each character in the input string `s`.
4. The `if char == ']':` condition checks if the current character `char` is a closing bracket ']'. If it is, it means a closing bracket is encountered, so the `closed` counter is incremented by 1 with `closed += 1`.
5. If the current character is not a closing bracket, it must be an opening bracket '['. So, the `open` counter is incremented by 1 in the else block with `open += 1`.
6. The `if closed > open:` line checks whether the number of closed brackets has exceeded the number of open brackets. If this condition is ever True within the string, it means there is a mismatch of brackets and the function returns `False` immediately, since a valid nested bracket sequence cannot be formed.
7. If the loop completes without any mismatches, the last line `return not open` checks if there are any open brackets remaining. If there are none, it means a valid nested sequence was found, and the function returns `True`. If there is at least one open bracket remaining, it returns `False.`

The script handles the test cases provided in the prompt's description, and the function `is_nested` will return the correct values when called with the respective strings.
