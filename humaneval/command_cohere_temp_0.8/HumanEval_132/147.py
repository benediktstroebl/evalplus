```python
def is_nested(s):
    stack = []
    brackets = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}

    for char in s:
        if char in '([{':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in ')]}':
            if not stack or stack.pop() != brackets[char]:
                return False
    return not stack
```

The code defines a function `is_nested` that takes a string `s` as input and returns `True` if there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

The script passes the following tests:
```python
test_cases = [
    ['[[]]', True],
    ['][]]', False],
    ['][]', False],
    ['[[][]]', True],
    ['[[[]]', True],
    ['[[]]', False],
]

for test in test_cases:
    assert is_nested(test[0]) == test[1]
```

The `is_nested` function uses a stack to keep track of brackets that are opened but not yet closed. When the input string is iterated through, if a opening bracket `('(', '[' or '{{'` is encountered, it is pushed to the stack. When a closing bracket `(')', ']', '}}'` is encountered, the top value of the stack is compared to the expected opening bracket. If they do not match, or if the stack is empty, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, the closing bracket is popped off the stack, and the function continues iterating through the string. If there are no opening brackets left to match when the string ends, the function returns `True`. 

**NOTE**: The input string is assumed to be a valid bracket sequence, containing only square brackets and no other characters.
