```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[':
            open += 1
        elif char == ']':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open != closed
```

The function counts the opening and closing brackets `[` and `]` as it iterates over the input string. The algorithm quickly determines whether the number of opening brackets exceeds the number of closing brackets at any point; if it does, the function returns False since a valid subsequence with nested brackets cannot exist. The algorithm also correctly handles cases where the number of opening and closing brackets is equal but not nested, achieving a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

To validate the performance, you can test the function with various input strings that include square brackets, like so:
```python
# Test Suite
assert is_nested('[[[])'] == True
assert is_nested('[]') == False
assert is_nested('[][]') == False
assert is_nested('[][]]') == True
assert is_nested('[[][]]') == True
assert is_nested('[][][[[]') == True
assert is_nested('[][][[[]') == True
assert is_nested('[][]]]]') == False
```
