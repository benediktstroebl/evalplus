```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == ']':
            close += 1
        else:
            open += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

The function counts the open and close brackets accordingly during the iteration through the string. Finally, it compares both counts, returning False if the count of open brackets is greater than the count of close brackets, which indicates an invalid subsequence of brackets.

To ensure that at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested, the algorithm verifies if the count of open brackets is equal to the count of close brackets, and if it is, returns True indicating a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested.
