```python
def is_nested(s):
    stack = []
    brackets = {']': '[', '}': '{{', ')': '('}

    for bracket in s:
        if bracket in brackets.values():
            stack.append(bracket)
        else:
            try:
                top_bracket = stack.pop()
            except IndexError:
                return False
            if brackets[top_bracket] != bracket:
                return False
    return not stack
```

The provided code defines a function `is_nested` that takes a string `s` as input and returns `True` if there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested, and `False` otherwise.

The code uses a stack to keep track of opened brackets and checks each bracket in the input string against the top bracket in the stack. If they do not form a valid pair, the stack will be empty, and the function will return False. Otherwise, if there's at least one nested bracket pair, the function will return True.
