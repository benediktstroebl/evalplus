```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[' :
            open += 1
        elif char == ']' :
            closed += 1
        if closed > open :
            return False
    return True
```
The provided code defines a function that takes a string as input and returns True if the string contains a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested. The function counts the open and closed brackets and returns False if the number of closed brackets is greater than the number of open brackets at any point, which indicates an invalid bracket sequence. The provided tests demonstrate the correct behavior of the function.
