```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[':
            open += 1
        elif char == ']':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open != closed
```

The function uses two counters to track the difference between open and closed brackets in the given string. The code works by iterating through the characters of the input string and incrementing the appropriate counter depending on whether the character is an open or closed bracket. If at any point the number of open brackets exceeds the number of closed brackets, the function returns False since there is no possible valid subsequence of nested brackets. Otherwise, if the end of the string is reached and the counters are equal, it returns True, indicating the presence of at least one nested bracket in the sequence.

Here is a test drive code to test the above function:
```python
def test_is_nested():
    assert is_nested("[[[]]")
    assert not is_nested("[][]")
    assert is_nested("[]")
    assert not is_nested("[[[]]]")
    assert is_nested("[][[]]")
    assert is_nested("[[[]]][[[]]]")
    assert not is_nested("[][][[[]]]")
``` 

 Executing this test drive code ensures that the function behaves as expected and aligns with the problem statement's requirements.
