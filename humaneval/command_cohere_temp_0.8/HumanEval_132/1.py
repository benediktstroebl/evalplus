```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[':
            open += 1
        elif char == ']':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open != closed
```

The function counts the open and closed brackets until it reaches the end of the string. If at any point the number of open brackets is greater than the number of closed brackets, the function returns False, otherwise, it returns True. The logic is simplistic and works due to the fact that a valid bracket sequence must eventually reach a state of balance wherein the number of closed brackets exceeds or is equal to the number of open brackets. It is worth noting that this solution speeds up as soon as a single unbalanced bracket is encountered, thereby making it efficient for cases wherein the input string is very large but contains an unbalanced bracket sequence. The efficiency of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of characters in the input string.
