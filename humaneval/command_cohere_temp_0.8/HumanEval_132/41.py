```python
def is_nested(s):
    stack = []
    for i, br in enumerate(s):
        if br == '[':
            stack.append(i)
        elif br == ']':
            if not stack or stack.pop() != i - 1:
                return False
    return not stack
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `is_nested` that takes a string as input. This function is designed to determine if the input string contains a valid subsequence of square brackets, where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested. The function achieves this by maintaining a stack of indices where opening brackets are encountered and traversing the input string. When a closing bracket ']' is encountered, the function checks if it matches the most recent opening bracket or if the stack is empty, indicating an improperly closed bracket. If any such discrepancies are found, the function returns False, indicating the absence of a valid nested bracket sequence. Otherwise, if the stack is empty at the end of the string, it returns True, confirming the presence of at least one nested bracket in the valid subsequence.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the `is_nested` function operates:
1. The function starts with an empty stack called `stack`, which is a data structure that will be used to keep track of opening brackets.
2. The function iterates through each character of the input string `s` using a loop.
3. Inside the loop, the function checks if the current character is an opening bracket '[' with the help of the `br` variable, which is set to the current character in each iteration.
4. If the current character is an opening bracket, the function pushes the current index `i` onto the stack. This step records the position of each opening bracket encountered in the input string.
5. If the current character is a closing bracket ']', the function performs a series of checks:
   a. It checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means there is no matching opening bracket to pair with the current closing bracket, so the function returns False immediately.
   b. If the stack is not empty, the function pops an element from the stack. This operation retrieves the index of the matching opening bracket that should correspond to the current closing bracket.
   c. The function compares the popped index with the current index `i`. If they do not match, it means the current closing bracket ']' does not correctly match with the most recent opening bracket, or it is mismatched in terms of nesting levels. In this case, the function returns False immediately.
6. If the loop completes without returning False, it means that all closing brackets ']' in the string have correctly matched with their respective opening brackets '[' and there are no extra closing brackets without matching openings. In this case, the function returns True, indicating the presence of at least one nested bracket sequence in the input string.

Additionally, here are test cases that can be used to verify the correctness of the `is_nested` function:
```python
test_cases = [
    "[[]]",
    "[][]",
    "[]]",
    "[[][]]",
    "[[]][[]]",
    "[[[[[[[[[[[[]]]]]]]]]]]]",
    "[[[[[[[[]]]])]]]",
]

for case in test_cases:
    assert is_nested(case) == True

invalid_cases = [
    "[]]",
    "[][]",
    "[[[[[[[[[[[[]]]]]]]]]]]]",
    "[[[[[[[[]]]])]]]",
]

for case in invalid_cases:
    assert is_nested(case) == False
```
