```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[':
            open += 1
        elif char == ']':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open != close
```

The function counts the open and closed brackets `[` and `]` as it iterates over the input string. If the count of open brackets ever exceeds the count of closed brackets, the function returns `False` since a nested bracket cannot form. Otherwise, if the counts are equal, it returns `True` indicating the presence of at least one nested bracket in the sequence.

Let's break down the code:
1. `def is_nested(s):`: This line defines a function named `is_nested` that takes a single argument `s`, which is the string containing only square brackets that we want to analyze.
2. `open, close = 0, 0`: These lines initialize two variables `open` and `close` with an initial value of 0. They are used to keep track of the count of opening and closing brackets encountered in the string.
3. `for char in s:`: This line starts a loop that iterates through each character in the input string `s`.
4. `if char == '[':`: If the current character is an open bracket `[']`, the `open` counter is incremented by 1, reflecting that an open bracket has been encountered.
5. `elif char == ']':`: If the current character is a closing bracket `[']`, the `close` counter is incremented by 1, indicating a closing bracket has been encountered.
6. `if open > close:`: After iterating through the string, this line checks to see if the count of open brackets is greater than the count of closed brackets. If this condition is true, it means there is no valid way to close all opening brackets with corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns `False`.
7. `return open != close`: If the count of openings and closings is equal (meaning there is at least one nested bracket), the function returns `True`. 

This solution is succinct and directly answers the problem statement without extra complexities. It also has a minimal time complexity of O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string, since it basically counts occurrences of characters once.
