```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[' :
            open += 1
        elif char == ']':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open != closed
```

The function counts the opening and closing brackets accordingly to make the decision. It increases the `open` counter whenever it encounters an opening bracket `[`, and decreases the `closed` counter whenever it encounters a closing bracket `]`. If at any point the counter `open` is larger than `closed`, it means there arent enough closing brackets, and the function returns `False`. If at the end of the string the counters are not equal, meaning that one bracket is nested, the function returns `True`. 

Such a logic can be considered a variation of the **Depth-First Search** algorithm, also known as **Stack Overflow**. Using the stack to keep track of braces will lead to a correct solution, however, it may not be the most efficient approach. 

The given code takes linear time, meaning that its performance is proportional to the size of the input string `s`.
