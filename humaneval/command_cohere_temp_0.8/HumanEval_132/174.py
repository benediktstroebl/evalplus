```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[':
            open += 1
        elif char == ']':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open != closed
```

The function counts the opening and closing brackets and checks if the balance is maintained. The opening bracket '[' is incremented by 1 when encountered, and the closing bracket ']' is incremented by 1 when encountered. The function returns False if the count of open brackets is greater than the count of closed brackets at any point, indicating an imbalanced or improperly nested sequence. It returns True if the count remains balanced throughout the sequence, indicating the presence of at least one nested bracket sequence.
