```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[':
            open += 1
        elif char == ']':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open != closed
```

The function counts the opening and closing brackets respectively whenever it encounters a '[' or a ']' in the string. Once it finishes going through the string, the function returns False if the count of opening brackets is not equal to the count of closing brackets, implying no valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested. The function returns True if the counts are equal, implying at least one bracket is nested in the sequence.

The given examples test cases correspond to:
```
is_nested('[[]]') -> True
is_nested('[]]]]]]][[[[[]') -> False
is_nested('[][]') -> False
is_nested('[]') -> False
is_nested('[[][]]') -> True
is_nested('[[]][[') -> True
```
