```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[' :
            open += 1
        elif char == ']' :
            close += 1
        if open > close :
            return False
        elif close > open :
            return True
    return open == close
```

The provided code defines a function `is_nested` that determines whether a given square bracket string contains a valid nested bracket sequence. It counts the opening and closing brackets encountered through its iteration and returns `True` if these counts are equal, implying a balanced or nested sequence. The function returns `False` if the closing brackets exceed the opening ones, indicating an unbalanced or incomplete sequence, or if the opening brackets exceed the closing ones, suggesting extra opening brackets.
