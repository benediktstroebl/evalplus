```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[':
            open += 1
        elif char == ']':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open != closed
```

The function counts the opening and closing brackets respectively whenever it encounters a '[', and whenever it encounters a ']'. If at any point the number of openings is greater than the number of closings, this indicates the presence of at least one unsynchronized bracket, and the function returns False. If at any point the stack of openings exceeds the stack of closings, the function returns True, as long as the total count of openings and closings is equal at the end. The provided code solves the problem accordingly.
