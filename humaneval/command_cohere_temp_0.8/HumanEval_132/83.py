```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[':
            open += 1
        elif char == ']':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open != closed
```

The function counts the opening and closing brackets accordingly to validate the presence of a nested bracket. It keeps tracking the balance of brackets and verifies if the result is not zero to ensure there is at least one nested bracket. 

This solution works accordingly to the algorithm provided in the use case. 

To ensure that this solution works correctly, you can test it against the provided examples, which include edge cases, and verify that it returns the expected outputs.
