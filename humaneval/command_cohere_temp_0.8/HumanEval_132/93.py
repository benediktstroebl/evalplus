```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[':
            open += 1
        elif char == ']':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open != close
```

The function counts the open and close brackets with two counters. The code then compares the values of both counters at the end to determine if it is a valid sequence and if any brackets are nested. The function returns `True` if there is a valid subsequence with at least one nested bracket as requested. 

Is there anything else I can help you with? Let me know if you would like me to explain any part of the code in detail.
