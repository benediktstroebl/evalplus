```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[':
            open += 1
        elif char == ']':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open != closed
```

The function counts the opening and closing brackets `[]` in the string `s` as it iterates through it. If at any point the number of open brackets is greater than the number of closed brackets, the function returns `False` since there is no possible valid subsequence of nested brackets. Otherwise, if at the end of the string the counts are equal, it returns `True` since there is at least one valid subsequence of nested brackets. 

This solution works for both single and multiple characters (e.g. '[]' vs. '[][]').
