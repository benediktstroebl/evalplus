```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[':
            open += 1
        else:
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open != close
```

The function counts the opening and closing square brackets and checks if the balance is maintained. The requirement of having at least one nested bracket is accounted for by checking that the balance is not strictly maintained.
