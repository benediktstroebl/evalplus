The following code snippet efficiently determines whether a square bracket string contains a nested bracket sequence. It utilizes a stack to track open brackets and checks if there is at least one nested bracket pair in the sequence. The function returns True if there is at least one nested bracket pair and False otherwise. Feel free to test the function with various input strings to verify its correctness.  The given problem can be effectively solved using techniques related to stacks and DFS. A stack is a data structure that follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle. In this problem, we can use a stack to keep track of opened brackets. 

Then we can iterate through the input string and do the following: 
1. If the character is an opening bracket, push it to the stack. 
2. If the character is a closing bracket and the stack is not empty, we check if it matches the top element of the stack. If it does, we pop the stack. 
3. If the character is a closing bracket and the stack is empty, return False since it signifies an unbalanced bracket. 

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code: 
1. The `def is_nested(s)` function takes a string s as input, which contains only square brackets. 
2. The `stack = []` creates an empty stack data structure to keep track of opened brackets. `brackets = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}` creates a dictionary to store the pair of opening and closing brackets. 
3. The `for char in s:` loop iterates through each character in the input string s. 
4. Inside the loop, if the `char` is an opening bracket, it is pushed onto the `stack` with `stack.append(char)`. If it is a closing bracket, we check if the stack is empty or not. 

Here we use the `not` operator to check if the stack is empty at the beginning, which is more efficient than checking if the length of the stack is 0. If the stack is not empty, we check if the closing bracket matches the top element of the stack. If it does, we pop the top element from the stack. If the closing bracket does not match the top element of the stack, it means there is an unbalanced bracket, and we return False. If the loop completes without finding any unbalanced brackets, it means there is at least one nested bracket pair, and we return True. Mention the time complexity to the closest Big Oh. Would it be O(N), O(N log N), or O(1)? Please explain any assumptions. 
The provided solution employs a stack data structure to keep track of opening brackets and iterates through the input string just once, making the time complexity O(N), where N is the size of the input string. During the single pass through the string, operations like pushing to the stack (O(1)) and popping the stack (O(1)) are performed. The stack operations are linear to the number of opening brackets encountered, hence the overall complexity is linearly proportional to the size of the input string.

This solution is efficient because it avoids recursion and uses a single loop, resulting in
