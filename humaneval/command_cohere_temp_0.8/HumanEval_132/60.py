```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == ']':
            closed += 1
            open -= 1
        else:
            open += 1
    return closed > open
```

The code defines a function `is_nested()` that takes a string as an input and checks whether the number of closed brackets (`closed`) is greater than or equal to the number of open brackets (`open`), if so, at least one bracket in the sequence is nested. The function returns `True` in this case; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

The markdown code block describes a few test scenarios to validate the correctness of the provided solution. The implementation of the function can be combined with the test cases in one script to verify the correct implementation of the solution. 

For example, the first test case `'[[]]'` checks if the function correctly identifies a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested. The expected output for this test case is `True`, indicating that the function should return `True` as there is a valid subsequence of brackets `[` and `]` where `[` is nested within `]`. 

The other test cases assess different scenarios where the function's behavior is appropriately evaluated against the problem's requirements.
