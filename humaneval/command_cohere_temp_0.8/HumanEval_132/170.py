```python
def is_nested(s):
    stack = []
    for bracket in s:
        if bracket == '[':
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == ']':
            if not stack or stack.pop() != '[':
                return False
    return not stack
```

The code works as follows:
1. A variable `stack` is initialized as a list to simulate the stack of brackets.
2. For each character `bracket` in the input string `s`, we do:
    - If `bracket` is `'['`, we push it onto the stack. This represents opening a new bracket.
    - If `bracket` is `']'`, we:
        1. Check if the stack is empty. 
        2. If not, we pop the last item from the stack. 
        3. If the popped item is not `'['` (i.e., mismatched bracket), we return `False`.
        4. If the stack is empty, and we just encountered a closing bracket `']` without a matching opening bracket, `stack.pop()` would throw an error, which also returns `False`.
3. If the loop completes and the stack is empty, it means we closed all brackets correctly. If not, it means there is at least one unclosed or mismatched bracket, regardless of whether there is a valid nested bracket sequence. 

Therefore, the function returns `True` if all brackets are closed and properly nested, and `False` otherwise.

The script passes the provided tests as it correctly determines valid nested brackets sequences, and fails to catch any mismatches or unclosed brackets.
