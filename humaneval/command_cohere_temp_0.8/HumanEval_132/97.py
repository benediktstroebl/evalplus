```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == ']':
            closed += 1
            open -= 1
        else:
            open += 1
    return closed > open
```

The function counts the open and closed brackets and checks if the number of closed brackets is greater than the number of open brackets. The steps to solve the problem are the following:
- Define a function `is_nested()` that takes a string as an input and returns a boolean.
- Initialize two counters, `open` and `closed`, which track the number of open and closed brackets respectively.
- Iterate through each character in the string.
- If the character is a closing bracket ']':
    - Increment the closed bracket counter by 1.
    - Decrement the open bracket counter by 1, this accounts for the fact that a closed bracket ']' corresponds to an open bracket '[' that is now closed.
- Otherwise, if the character is an opening bracket '[':
    - Increment the open bracket counter by 1.
- Return `closed > open`, this checks if there is at least one nested bracket in the sequence, as described in the problem statement.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, since it iterates through each character in the string once and performs a constant amount of operations for each character. It can efficiently handle various input scenarios and produce the correct results accordingly.
