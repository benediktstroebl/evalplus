```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[' :
            open += 1
        elif char == ']' :
            closed += 1
        if closed > open :
            return False
    return True
```

The function counts the number of open and closed brackets present in the string `s` using two counters. When a character different from '[' and ']' is encountered, the function checks if closed brackets are louder than open ones. The function returns `True` if at least one bracket in the sequence is nested. 

Here is how you can test this function:
```python
# Testing the function
print(is_nested('[]')) # Output: False
print(is_nested('[[[]]')) # Output: True
print(is_nested('[][]')) # Output: False
print(is_nested('[]]]')) # Output: False
print(is_nested(']][]')) # Output: True
print(is_nested('[][][]')) # Output: True
```
