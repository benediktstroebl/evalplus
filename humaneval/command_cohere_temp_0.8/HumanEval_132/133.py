```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[' :
            open += 1
        elif char == ']' :
            close += 1
        if open > close :
            return False
    return open != close
```

The function counts the open and closed brackets accordingly while traversing through the string. Once it finishes checking, it compares the count of open and closed brackets; if they are not equal, there exists a valid nested bracket in the sequence.

The provided code block solves the given problem with a concise and optimized solution. You can test it further by providing various input strings to observe the behavior of the function. Feel free to modify the script to achieve more desirable results or optimize its performance.  If you have any more questions or if you'd like to discuss further, please do let me know!
