```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[' :
            open += 1
        elif char == ']' :
            close += 1
        if open > close :
            return False
        elif close > open :
            return True
    return open == close
```

The function uses two counters to track the quantities of open and closed brackets. The logic behind this algorithm is that a valid bracket sequence must have a closing bracket for every open bracket, and at least one close bracket should be opened. The function returns false if the closing brackets exceed the opening brackets at any moment. Otherwise, it returns true after traversing the entire string, if the number of opening brackets is equal to that of the closing ones. 

For better readability, the code includes comments that describe the purpose of the algorithm and the conditions under which it returns true or false.
