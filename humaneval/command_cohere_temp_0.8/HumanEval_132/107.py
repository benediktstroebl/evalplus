```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[':
            open += 1
        elif char == ']':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open != close
```

The function counts the openings and closings of brackets as it iterates through the string. The bracket sequence is valid if these counts have different values at some point during the iteration. The returned value corresponds to whether the bracket sequence has a valid subsequence as described in the prompt.
