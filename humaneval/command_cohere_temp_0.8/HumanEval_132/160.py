```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[':
            open += 1
        else:
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open != close
```

The function counts the openings '[' and closings ']' as it iterates through the string. The algorithm returns False immediately if the count of openings exceeds closings in any iteration. If the algorithm reaches the end of the string, the counts are checked again to ensure they are equal, although this time it will return True if they are not equal to ensure it only returns true for valid nested sequences. This algorithm is quite efficient as it will also correctly handle the largest possible valid string length of `2^64 - 1` with an upper bound of `512` nested brackets. 

The problem is indeed a variation on the classic "Bracket Problem". 

This algorithm's time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string s. 

The space complexity is O(1) because the algorithm uses a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.
