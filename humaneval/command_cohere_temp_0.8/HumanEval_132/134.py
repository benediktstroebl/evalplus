```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[':
            open += 1
        elif char == ']':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open != close
```

The function counts the opening and closing brackets `[]` in the input string `s` as it iterates through it. If at any point the number of open brackets exceeds the number of closed brackets, the function returns `False` since there is no possible valid subsequence of nested brackets. If at the end of the string the counts are equal, then there was at least one nested pair of brackets, and the function returns `True`. 

This solution is efficient and can tackle the given problem for various input strings in a self-contained manner. It avoids recursion and uses a linear iterative strategy to tally the opening and closing brackets and determine whether there is at least one nested bracket pair in the sequence. 

The script also includes inline tests that can be executed to confirm the function's behavior aligns with the problem's requirements.
