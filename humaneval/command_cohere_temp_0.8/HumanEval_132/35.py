```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[':
            open += 1
        elif char == ']':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open != closed
```

The function counts the open and closed brackets incrementally as it iterates through the string. If at any point the number of open brackets exceeds the number of closed brackets, the function returns `False` since a valid subsequence with nested brackets cannot exist. If at the end the number of open and closed brackets is not equal, then at least one bracket must be nested, and the function returns `True`. 

This solution works because every open bracket must be closed by a subsequent closed bracket. Therefore, if a valid subsequence of brackets exists where at least one bracket is nested, the total count of open and closed brackets throughout the entire sequence must be equal to each other.
