```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[':
            open += 1
        elif char == ']':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open != closed
```

The function counts the open and closed brackets incrementally as it traverses the string. If at any point the number of open brackets exceeds the number of closed brackets, the function returns `False` since a valid subsequence with nested brackets cannot exist. If at the end of the string the counts are equal, then a valid subsequence with nested brackets exists, and the function returns `True`.
