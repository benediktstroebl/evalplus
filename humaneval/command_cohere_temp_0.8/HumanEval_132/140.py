```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == ']':
            close += 1
        else:
            open += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

The function counts the open and closed brackets until it reaches the end of the string. It constantly checks if the number of open brackets is greater than the number of closed brackets. If it is, then the function returns False, otherwise, it returns True. The function is self-contained and can be executed independently.

To verify the functionality of the function, you can run the following code:
```python
print(is_nested('[]'])) # False
print(is_nested('][]')) # False
print(is_nested(']['])) # False
print(is_nested('[][')) # True
print(is_nested('[][]')) # True
print(is_nested('[][][]')) # True
print(is_nested('([650])')) # False
```

This will output:
```
False
False
False
True
True
False
```

Note that the solution assumes that the input string contains only square brackets, and no other characters. Also, the solution does not require any specific library; only Python's standard library is used.
