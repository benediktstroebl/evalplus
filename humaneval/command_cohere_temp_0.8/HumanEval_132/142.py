```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[' :
            open += 1
        elif char == ']' :
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return True
```

The provided code defines a function `is_nested` which takes a string as an input and returns `True` if the string contains a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

The algorithm counts the open and closed brackets as it iterates through the string. Once an unbalanced segment is detected (where `open > closed`), the algorithm returns `False` immediately, since an unbalanced segment implies that no valid subsequence exists. If the loop completes without encountering an imbalance, the algorithm returns `True`, indicating the presence of at least one correctly nested subsequence.
