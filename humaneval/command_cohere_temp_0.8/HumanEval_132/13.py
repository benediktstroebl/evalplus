```python
def is_nested(s):
    stack = []
    brackets = {']': '[', '}': '(', ']': '['}

    for char in s:
        if char in '][(':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in '[]{}':
            if not stack or stack.pop() != brackets[char]:
                return False
        else:
            return False

    return not stack
```

The code defines a function `is_nested` that uses a stack to keep track of whether brackets are nested correctly. Starting with an empty string, we iterate through the characters of the input string. If the current character is a closing bracket (']', ')', or ']'), we push it onto the stack. If the current character is an opening bracket ('[', '(' or '['), we check if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack is not the matching closing bracket for the current opening bracket. If either condition is false, it returns False since there is no valid nested bracket sequence. Otherwise, we pop the last bracket from the stack (which should be the corresponding opening bracket) and continue iterating through the string. If the loop completes without returning False, the function returns True, indicating that there is at least one valid nested bracket sequence in the string.

Here's a succinct example usage of the function:
```python
print(is_nested("[[[[]]]"])) // True
print(is_nested("[[[[[()()()]]]]")) // False
```

The first test case will return True since there is a nested sequence of brackets consisting of two pairs of square brackets and one pair of parentheses. The second test case will return False since there is no nested sequence of brackets even though there are multiple sequences of brackets because all the parentheses are wrongly nested.
