```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[':
            open += 1
        elif char == ']':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open != closed
```

The function counts the open and closed brackets accordingly while traversing through the given string. Once it finishes traversing, if the count of open brackets differs from the count of closed brackets, then there exists a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested.
