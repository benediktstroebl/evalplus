```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[':
            open += 1
        elif char == ']':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open != closed
```

The function uses two counters to track the difference between open and closed brackets in the given string. The code works thanks to the following reasoning:
- We know that any valid bracket sequence must reach an equilibrium state in which open and closed brackets differ at most by one (due to the requirement of the problem that at least one bracket in the subsequence must be nested).
- Therefore, if we count the number of open and closed brackets as we traverse the input string, and at any point open is greater than closed, it means that we are in a violated state, and the bracket sequence cannot reach a valid equilibrium state, so we return False.
- If we successfully traverse the entire string without the open count ever exceeding the closed count, then we guarantee that a valid equilibrium state where open == closed + 1 or open == closed - 1 will be reached, and so we return True.

The provided code is the most direct and most efficient way to solve this problem, using only two counters and a state machine transiting through the string. There are no other complex optimizations or mathematical approaches needed.
