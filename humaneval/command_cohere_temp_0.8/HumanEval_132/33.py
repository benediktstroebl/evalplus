```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == ']':
            closed += 1
        else:
            open += 1
        if closed > open:
            return False
    return not open
```

The code defines a function `is_nested` that takes a string as input and checks if it contains a valid subsequence of square brackets, where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested. The function counts the opening and closing brackets encountered in the string using two counters `open` and `closed`. If at any point the `closed` counter is greater than the `open` counter, it indicates an unbalanced bracket sequence, and the function returns `False`. Otherwise, if there are no opening brackets remaining at the end of the string, it returns `True`, indicating a valid nested sequence.

Here is a test drive code to test the above function:
```python
# Test drive code
assert is_nested('[[[])'] == True
assert is_nested('[[[]') == True
assert is_nested('[][]') == False
assert is_nested(']][]') == False
assert is_nested(']]]])') == False
assert is_nested('[[[[[[[]]]]]]]') == True
``` 

This test drive code exercises the `is_nested` function with different test cases and validates its correctness against the specified conditions.
