```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[' :
            open += 1
        elif char == ']':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open != closed
```

The function counts the open and closed brackets initiated by the variable `open` and `closed` respectively. It increases or decreases these counters depending on whether the current character is an open or closed bracket. At the end, there must be a difference of at least 1 between the counters for there to be a valid nested bracket. The function returns `False` in all other cases, including an empty string, unbalanced brackets, or too many closing brackets. 

Here is a nested version of the original markdown code:
```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[': 
            open += 1
        elif char == ']': 
            closed += 1
        if open > closed: 
            return False
        elif open == closed: 
            if open != 0 and closed != 0: 
                return False
            open += 1
            closed += 1
    return open != closed
```

This new test case further emphasizes the need for at least one nested bracket. As long as there is at least one valid subsequence of nested brackets, the function will return `True`. It also prevents the possibility of an infinite loop as it is not necessary to check for strictly increasing opening brackets. 

The given code is concise and elegant as it is, but certain edge cases can always be added for the function to handle. These could be added in the form of additional test cases to further improve the code and ensure it handles all scenarios correctly.
