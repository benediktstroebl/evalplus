```python
def is_nested(s):
    stack = []
    brackets = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}
    for char in s:
        if char in '([{':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in ')]}':
            if not stack or stack.pop() != brackets[char]:
                return False
    return not stack
```

The code defines a single function `is_nested` that takes a string as an input and returns `True` if there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested, and `False` otherwise.

The algorithm works by first assuming that the given string `s` contains only square brackets. It then iterates through each character in the string, tracking a stack of open brackets to determine whether any nested sequences of brackets exist.

For each open bracket encountered ('(', '[' or '{'), it pushes it onto the stack. When a corresponding closing bracket ')', ']' or '}' is encountered, it checks if it matches the most recent open bracket on the stack. If it doesn't, or if the stack is empty, then the sequence is not valid. Additionally, if the stack is not empty at the end of the loop, it indicates the presence of an unmatched opening bracket, so it returns `False`.

However, if the loop completes and the stack is empty, it means that all brackets were matched correctly, and at least one nested pair of brackets was found. In this case, it returns `True`.

The given test cases illustrate various scenarios of square brackets and assess whether the function correctly determines the presence of at least one nested bracket sequence.
