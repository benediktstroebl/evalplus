```python
def is_nested(s):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '[' :
            open += 1
        elif char == ']' :
            closed += 1
        if closed > open:
            return False
    return True
```

The provided code defines a Python function called `is_nested` that takes a string as input. This function is designed to determine if the provided string contains a valid subsequence of square brackets, where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested. The function counts the opening and closing square brackets as it iterates through the string and checks if the number of closed brackets is always greater than or equal to the number of open brackets. If this condition is met throughout the entire string, it returns `True`, indicating the presence of at least one nested bracket sequence. If at any point the number of closed brackets falls behind the number of open brackets, indicating an unbalanced bracket sequence, it returns `False`. This function encapsulates the logic needed to solve the problem statement completely within the code block, making it self-contained and easily executable as is for testing or usage in other scripts.
