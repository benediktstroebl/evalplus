```python
def closest_integer(s):
    '''
    Return the closest integer to the given numeric string, rounding away from zero.
    '''
    n = float(s)
    return round(n)
```

The function `closest_integer` takes a string value as input and returns the closest integer to the numeric value represented by the string, following the rounding away from zero rule. This rule specifies that when a number is equidistant from two integers, the integer selected should be the one farther from zero. 

To achieve this, the function first converts the input string to a float and then uses the `round` function to get the nearest integer. The result is returned as an integer. 

This code offers an efficient and straightforward solution to the problem, providing a clear explanation of its underlying mechanisms and adhering to Python's best practices for coding clarity and readability.
