```python
def closest_integer(s):
    '''
    Returns the closest integer to the given numeric string, rounding away from zero.
    '''
    n = float(s)
    return round(n)
```

The function `closest_integer()` takes a string value as input and returns the closest integer value to the numeric value represented by the input string, according to the rounding rule of rounding away from zero. This behavior is achieved by first converting the input string to a float value using the `float()` function, then using the `round()` function to round it to the nearest integer. The returned integer value represents the closest integer to the original numeric value, rounded away from zero. 

This approach ensures that the function always rounds up if the decimal value is greater than or equal to half the unit increment, and it always rounds down if the decimal value is less than half the unit increment, adhering to the requirement of rounding away from zero in case of equidistant values.
