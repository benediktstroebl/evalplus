```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): The input value as a string representing a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the input value.
    """
    n = float(s)
    io = int(n)
    if n - io == 0:
        return io

    else:
        return io - 1
```

The function `closest_integer` takes a string `s` as input, which represents a number. It first converts the input value to a floating-point number `n` and then checks if the floating-point number is equally distant from two integers `io` (integer version of `n`) round away from zero. If so, it returns the integer version of `n`. If not, it returns `io + 1` or `io - 1`, depending on whether the number is closer to the next higher integer or the next lower integer. It thereby adheres to the "round away from zero" rule. 

The `round_to_closest_integer` function provides an example of how to use the `closest_integer` function to round a float to the closest integer according to the specified rules.
