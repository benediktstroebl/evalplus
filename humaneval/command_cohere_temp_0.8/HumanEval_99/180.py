```python
def closest_integer(s):
    '''
    Returns the closest integer to the given numeric string, rounding away from zero.
    '''
    return round(float(s), 0, -1)
```

The function `round` is utilized with the parameters `float(s)`, `0` for rounding away from zero, and `-1` to utilize the "floor" mode, which rounds the closest integer down in case of a tie. Furthermore, the docstring provides detailed information about the function, including examples and a note that highlights the rounding strategy.
