    n = float(s)
    i = int(n)
    d = n - i
    if d == 0:

```

The function takes a string `s` as input, representing a number, and follows the requirement of rounding away from zero while considering equidistant values. It first converts the input string to a float `n`, and then checks if the difference between `n` and its closest integer `i` is zero, in which case it returns `i`. If the difference `d` is greater than zero, it rounds up to the next integer, and conversely, if `d` is less than zero, it rounds down to the previous integer.
