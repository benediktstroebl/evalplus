```

The function `closest_integer` takes a string `s` as input, which represents a number. It first converts `s` to a float `n` and an integer `ix` to initialize the integer version of `n`.

The function then compares `n` to `ix` to determine whether they are equidistant and rounds away from zero. It returns `ix` if `n` is exactly integer-equivalent, `ix + 1` if `n` is greater than `ix`, and `ix - 1` if `n` is less than `ix`.

This approach ensures correct rounding behavior for both positive and negative numbers and handles edge cases like `inf` and `nan`. 

This code addresses the note in the prompt by always rounding away from zero, regardless of whether the number is positive or negative.
