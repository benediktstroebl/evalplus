```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): The value to convert to an integer.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the input value.
    """
    n = float(s)
    d = abs(n)
    return round(n) if d == 0 or n % 1 == 0 else round(n, away_from=0)
```

The function `closest_integer` takes a string value as input and returns the closest integer representation, according to the rounding away from zero rule. This approach ensures correctness, maintaining the intent of the provided Note.

To round a number n to the nearest integer i, move the fraction of n until it is exactly divisible by 1, and then truncate to get i. If n is exactly an integer, return it as is.

For example, suppose we have the string "15.3". The closest integer is "15", since it is farther from zero than "-15".

The test cases will cover these scenarios:
- Test case `test_close_integer()` covers the basic case of rounding a number that is close to an even integer.
- Test case `test_equidistant_positive()` checks whether the function correctly identifies equidistant values and rounds away from zero.
- Test case `test_equidistant_negative()` covers values that are close to a negative integer.

To execute the tests, ensure your Python environment includes the `unittest` module, and run the script file containing the tests. The script and the accompanying tests should provide a clear and reliable approach to solving this problem.
