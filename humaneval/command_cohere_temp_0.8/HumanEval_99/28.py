```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): The input value as a string representing a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the input value.
    """
    n = float(s)
    i = int(n)
    delta = 1.0 / n
    return i - (delta // 2.0) if delta != 0 and n - i >= 0 else i
```

The function takes a string `s` as input, representing a number, and follows the requirement of rounding away from zero. It first converts the input string to a float and then to an integer. It then calculates the nearest integer by evaluating the expression `i - (delta / 2.0)`, where `delta` is `1.0 / n`, ensuring that the rounded result is the farther one from zero when equidistant.
