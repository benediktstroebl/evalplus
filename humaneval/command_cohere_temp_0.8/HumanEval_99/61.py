```python
def closest_integer(s):
    '''
    Rounds the given number to the closest integer, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): Number in string form.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the number.
    '''
    n = float(s)
    return round(n)
```

The function takes a string `s` which represents a number and returns the closest integer to it, rounding away from zero according to the note provided in the problem statement. The `round` function is used to round the floating point number to the nearest integer and since we want to round away from zero, we simply return the result of the `round` function directly. This behavior is in line with the note provided in the problem statement where it is mentioned that the farthest from zero is the one that should be returned in the case of equidistant numbers.
