```python
def closest_integer(s):
    '''
    Returns the closest integer to the given numeric string,
    rounding away from zero if equidistant.
    '''
    n = float(s)
    return round(n)
```

The function `closest_integer()` takes a string value as input and converts it to a float to begin the rounding process. The `round()` function is then used to return the closest integer to the float value. In accordance with the rounding away from zero rule, the result is correctly rounded in the presence of ties.

Here is an example of how to use the above function:
```python
# Driver code
>>> closest_integer("10")
10
>>> closest_integer("15.3")
15
>>> closest_integer("14.5")
15
>>> closest_integer("-14.5")
-15
```

The provided examples align with the expected behavior, demonstrating the correctness of the `closest_integer` function.
