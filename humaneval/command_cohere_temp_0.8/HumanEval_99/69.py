```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given numeric string, rounding away from zero.
    
    Args:
        s (str): Numeric string representing a number.
    
    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the given number.
    """
    n = float(s)  # Convert string to float to handle decimal values
    # Check if the number is equidistant from two integers and round away from zero
    if n % 1 == 0.5:
        return round(n)
    return int(n)
```

This function initially transforms the input string into a float to accommodate decimal values. Subsequently, it examines whether the number is equidistant from two integers and employs the `round()` function to round it away from zero. If not equidistant, it is immediately returned as an integer. This handling ensures the function's compliance with the given note regarding rounding toward zero.
