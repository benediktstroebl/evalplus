```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given numeric string, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): Numeric string representing a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the input number.
    """
    n = float(s)
    return round(n)
```

The function `closest_integer` takes a string `s` representing a number as its argument and returns the closest integer to that number as an integer. By applying the `round` function on the converted number, it ensures the rounding behavior meets the specification of rounding away from zero. This behavior is crucial when dealing with numbers that are equidistant from two integers, ensuring consistency and avoiding unexpected outcomes.
