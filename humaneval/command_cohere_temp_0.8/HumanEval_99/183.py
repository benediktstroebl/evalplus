```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): A string representing a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the given value.
    """
    n = float(s)
    ix = int(n)  # Attempt to convert to integer,
    # and if it fails, float(n) is n (no exception raised)
    return round(n - (ix if ix == n else 0), 0) + (ix if ix == n else 0)
```

The function takes a string `s` as input and converts it to a float `n`. It then attempts to convert it to an integer using `int(n)`. If the conversion is successful and the integer value is equal to `n`, then it means that the number is already an integer, and we return it unchanged.

However, if the conversion to an integer succeeds and the resulting integer is not equal to `n`, it means we need to round it. In this case, we calculate `n - ix` where `ix` is the integer value. This difference is rounded (away from zero) using `round()`. The rounded difference is added back to the original integer `ix` to get the desired rounded integer value.

The code handles the edge case where the input is already an integer by ensuring that the float creation (`float(s)`) does not raise an exception. Thus, `ix` will equal `n` and the function will return the unchanged integer value.
