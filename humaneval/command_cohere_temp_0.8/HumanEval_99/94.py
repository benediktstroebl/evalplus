The function `closest_integer` uses a combination of conditional statements and basic arithmetic to round the number to the closest integer. It checks the absolute value of the number, and if the absolute value is less than or equal to 1, it returns the number as is (since any deviation from 1 would move it away from the integer it is closest to). 

If the absolute value is greater than 1, it checks if the number is equidistant from two integers and therefore must be rounded away from zero. It does this by checking if the number minus 1 and the number plus 1 are equal, in which case it rounds down if the original number is even, and up if the original number is odd. If the absolute value is not greater than 1, it returns the closest integer to the number. 

The conditional statements and simple mathematical principles used in this code enable it to accurately round numbers to the closest integer. 

To use this function:
1. Copy the function into your Python file.
2. Run the function with example inputs to verify it works as expected. 

For example:
```python
closest_integer("10")  # Expected output: 10
closest_integer("15.3")  # Expected output: 15
closest_integer("14.5")  # Expected output: 15
closest_integer("-14.5")  # Expected output: -15
```

This way, you can confirm that the function meets the criteria of the prompt, which is rounding the numbers to the closest integer with rounding away from zero for equidistant values.
