```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string representing a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the given value.
    """
    n = float(s)
    i = int(n)
    delta = 1.0 / n
    return i - (delta // 2.0) if delta % 1.0 == 0.0 else i
```

The function takes a string `s` as input and first converts it to a float `n`. It then checks if it can round to the nearest integer without affecting the value, in which case it does so, or it simply returns the int representation of `n`. The rounding away from zero rule is ensured by the subtraction of `delta // 2.0` in the former case. 

The following conditions are tested in the corresponding unit tests:
- Edge case for zero.
- Decimal values rounding.
- Integer values.
- Positive and negative decimals. 

To ensure correct rounding behavior, in case of a decimal value the function first checks if the decimal is precisely at the halfway point between two integers. If so, it adjusts the rounding away from zero rule by subtracting `delta // 2.0`, where `delta` is the difference between `n` and the closest integer. 

This way, the function rounds towards the farther integer in case of a tie.
