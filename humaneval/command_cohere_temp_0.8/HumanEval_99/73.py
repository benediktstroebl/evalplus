The function `closest_integer` takes a string `s` as input, which represents a number. It first converts `s` to a floating-point number `n`. If `n` has no fractional part (i.e., it is already an integer), it is returned as is. Otherwise, the function rounds `n` to the nearest integer using the `round` function. 

To handle the case where the number is equidistant from two integers, the function uses the `away_from` parameter of the `round` function, which is set to 0. This ensures that the function always rounds away from zero, consistent with the problem statement.
