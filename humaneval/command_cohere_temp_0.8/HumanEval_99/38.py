The function works by first converting the input string n to a float and int values. If the float is equidistant from two integers, it adjusts the integer value i and a delta value that indicates the direction of the closest integer. It then enters a loop where it repeatedly adjusts i and delta until the difference between the float and integer values is less than 0.5, ensuring it has converged on the correct answer. This approach avoids infinite looping and correctly handles both positive and negative numbers.
