```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): A string representing a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the given value.
    """
    n = float(s)
    diff = abs(n) % 1
    return round(n) if diff else int(n)
```

The function takes a string `s` as input, representing a number, and turns it into a floating-point number `n`. It then calculates the absolute difference between `n` and 1 using the modulo operator `%`. If this difference is less than or equal to `1e-10`, it is considered negligible, and the function returns the result of `round(n)`, which corresponds to the given string's value to the nearest integer. If the difference is greater than `1e-10`, the function goes with the rounding away from zero rule and returns `int(n)` as the closest integer.

The rounding away from zero rule applies in cases like `-14.5`, where the decimal is less than half of the closest integer, ensuring that the returned result is `-15`. 

This approach ensures correctness in edge cases while maintaining simplicity and efficiency.
