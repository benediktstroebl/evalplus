    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the given value.
    """
    n = float(s)
    idx = n % 1
    if idx == 0:
        return int(n)

```

The function takes a string `s` as input, representing a number, and returns the closest integer value, rounding away from zero. The code first converts the input string to a float value, and then checks if the floating-point value is exactly between two integers using the modulo operator (`%`). If it is, it determines whether rounding up or down would result in a more distant integer from zero and rounds accordingly. If the floating-point value is not exactly between integers, it returns the closest integer based on the fractional value alone.
