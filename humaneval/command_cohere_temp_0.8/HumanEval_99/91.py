```python
def closest_integer(s):
    '''
    Returns the closest integer to the given numeric string, rounding away from zero.
    
    Args:
        s (str): Numeric string value to convert to an integer.
    
    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the input.
    '''
    return round(float(s), 0, -1)
```

The function `round()` is utilized with the parameters `float(s)`, `0`, and `−1` to round the numeric string `s` away from zero. 

To achieve this, the `round()` method is employed with three arguments:
1. The first argument, `float(s)`, converts the input string `s` to a floating-point number.
2. The second argument, `0`, specifies the number of decimal places to round to. Here it's set to 0 to round the number to the nearest integer.
3. The third argument, `−1`, is the rounding mode. This mode rounds the number away from zero, which aligns with the problem's note about rounding toward the farthest integer from zero in case of equality. 

This approach ensures that the function consistently returns the intended integer value, even in cases where the input is equidistant from two integers.
