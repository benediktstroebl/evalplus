```

The function takes a string representing a number as input and returns the closest integer value, considering the rounding-away-from-zero rule. It first converts the input string to a float and then to an integer to determine the closest integer. Subsequently, it calculates the difference between the original number and the rounded integer. If the difference is zero, it means the number is already an integer; if the difference is greater than zero, it rounds up; and if it's less than zero, it rounds down.
