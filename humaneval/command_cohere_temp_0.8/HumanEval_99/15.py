```python
def closest_integer(s):
    '''
    Returns the closest integer to the given numeric string, rounding away from zero.
    
    Args:
        s (str): Numeric string representation of a number.
        
    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the given number.
    '''
    n = float(s)
    return round(n)
```

The `round` function is used to return the closest integer, taking care to round away from zero as per the problem's note. The float value `n` is obtained by converting the input string `s` to a float, which allows the `round` function to function correctly. 

This code assumes that the given string `s` is a valid numeric representation. If you would like to account for invalid inputs, you may want to add additional validation and error handling.
