```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given numeric string, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): Numeric string representing a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the input number.
    """
    n = float(s)
    return round(n)
```

The function `closest_integer` takes a string representation of a number as input and returns the closest integer value, rounding away from zero according to the rounding rule specified in the note. This behavior ensures consistency and complies with the provided example cases. 

The function relies on the rounding mechanism of the `round` function, which by default rounds away from zero in case of tie values. Thus, it eliminates the need for explicit conditional checks, making the code more concise and efficient.
