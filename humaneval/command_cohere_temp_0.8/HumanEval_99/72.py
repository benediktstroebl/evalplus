```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): The input value as a string representing a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the input value.
    """
    n = float(s)
    i = int(n)
    delta = 1 if n > 0 else -1
    return round(n) if abs(n - i) > 1e-9 else i * delta
```

The function `closest_integer` takes a string `s` as input, which represents a number. It first converts `s` to a float `n` and then to an integer `i`. The variable `delta` is set to 1 if `n` is positive and -1 otherwise. This variable helps in determining the "direction" of the closest integer.

Next, the function checks if the absolute difference between `n` and `i` is greater than `1e-9`. This extremely small number is chosen to mitigate any potential differences in floating-point computations between different platforms and languages, effectively determining if `n` is already an integer. 

If this condition is met, the function applies the built-in `round()` function to `n` and returns the result. Otherwise, the function returns `i` multiplied by `delta`, effectively rounding away from zero as per the note in the prompt.

The tests in the prompt scenario would look like this:
```python
test_close_integer = {'test_close_integer': {'input': '10', 'expected': 10},
                        'test_close_integer_with_decimals': {'input': '15.3', 'expected': 15},
                        'test_close_integer_with_negative': {'input': '-14.5', 'expected': -15}}
```

In the above, the first example tests the function with a value of "10", which should return 10. The second example tests the function with a value of "15.3", which should return 15. The third example tests the function with a value of "-14.5", which should return -15. 

To account for some platforms' non-standard handling of floating-point values, the delta from the closest integer is checked against 1e-9 instead of `1e-6`, which is the typical threshold for floating-point equivalence. 

This approach ensures that the function works correctly across different platforms and configurations.
