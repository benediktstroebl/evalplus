```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): A string representing a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the given value.
    """
    n = float(s)
    i = int(n)
    # Check if n is equidistant from two integers and round away from zero
    if n - i == 0.5:
        return int(n - 0.5)
    return i
```

This approach:
1. Converts the input string to a float to remove any punctuation, allowing decimal values.
2. Converts the float to an integer to identify the closest integer value.
3. Checks if the float is equidistant from two integers using a special case (`n - i == 0.5`).
4. Returns the closest integer by rounding the float value away from zero. 

This aligns with the problem's note regarding rounding away from zero. 

To better understand the logic, let's break down the code block step by step:
```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): A string representing a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the given value.
    """
    n = float(s)
    i = int(n)
    # Check if n is equidistant from two integers and round away from zero
    if n - i == 0.5:
        return int(n - 0.5)
    return i
```

Here's an explanation of each step:
1. **Function Definition (`def closest_integer(s):`)** — We start by defining a function named `closest_integer`, which takes a single argument `s`, representing a string of input. 

2. **Convert Input to Float (`n = float(s)})** — The input `s` is converted to a `float` value using the `float()` function. This step is essential because it allows us to work with decimal values and ignores any punctuation present in the input string, ensuring that the algorithm accurately rounds the numeric value.

3. **Convert Float to Integer (`i = int(n)`):** We immediately convert the `float` back to an `integer` using the `int()` function. This step gives us the closest integer representation of the original input value `s`. This integer value is crucial for the rounding decision in the next step.

4. **Identify Equidistant Float (`if n - i == 0.5`)** — Here, we perform a conditional check to determine if the `float` value `n` is equidistant from two integers. Specifically, the condition `n - i == 0.5` checks if the `float` is exactly halfway between two integers. If this condition is true, it means we need to round the value away from zero.

5. **Return Rounded Integer (`return int(n - 0.5)`):** If the condition above is true, we return the nearest integer by rounding the `float` value `n` downwards (away from zero). We achieve this by subtracting 0.5 from the `float` and converting it to an integer using the `int()` function. 

6. **Return Initial Integer (`return i`):** If the condition for equidistance is not met, we simply return the original integer value `i`, which is the closest integer to the original input `s`. 

This function ensures that it always rounds away from zero when the input is equid
