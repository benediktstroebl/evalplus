This script uses the `re` module to remove trailing decimal zeros and non-numeric characters from the input string. Then, it checks for infinity cases. Next, it converts the string to a float, rounding to the nearest integer using the `round` function with the `ROUND_HALF_UP` rounding strategy, which rounds away from zero in case of decimal values. Lastly, test cases are defined and executed to validate the function. 

Let's break down the solution further:
1. **Input Cleaning**: The initial step takes the cleaning of the input value to remove non-numeric and trailing decimal zeros from the input. This is done using the `re.sub` method, which replaces patterns matched with the specified substitute.
    
2. **Handling Infinity**: This part handles the edge case where the input is 'Infinity' or '-Infinity'. These strings evaluate as valid numeric values in Python, and the function should return infinity since there is no closest integer in this case.
    
3. **Rounding Strategy**: The `round` function is used to convert the float to the nearest integer. The `rounding` parameter is set to `ROUND_HALF_UP`, which is a built-in constant representing the rounding strategy. In case of a decimal value, this strategy rounds away from zero, as specified in the note in the problem statement.
    
4. **Test Cases**: The function is tested using a list of test cases, `tests`, where input-output pairs are defined. The `assert` statement checks if the output of the function matches the expected output for each test case.

The solution efficiently addresses the specified problem and ensures the correct rounding behavior, specifically rounding away from zero for decimal values that are equidistant from two integers.
