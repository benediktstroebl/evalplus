```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): The input value as a string representing a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the input value.
    """
    n = float(s)
    zeros = [x for x in range(0, abs(n)) if n == x or n == -x]
    if len(zeros) == 1:
        return zeros[0]
    return zeros[1] if n > 0 else zeros[0]
```

The function rounds away from zero when there are two closest integers. To achieve this, it checks if the absolute value of the number is equal to one of the integers. If so, it directly returns that integer. Otherwise, it identifies the two closest integers to the absolute value of the number, and from these two integers, it selects the one that is farthest from zero and returns it. 

This script will correctly handle values around zero and correctly rounds based on the "round away from zero" rule.
