```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): The value to convert to an integer.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the given value.
    """
    n = float(s)
    return round(n)
```

The function takes a string `s` as input and converts it to a float `n`. Then, it uses the `round` function to round `n` to the nearest integer and return the result. 

The rounding rule follows the "banker's rounding" or "round away from zero" rule, where the number is rounded to the nearest integer with the same sign as the input value.

This approach is straightforward and effectively converts the input value to the closest integer while adhering to the rounding rule specified in the prompt.
