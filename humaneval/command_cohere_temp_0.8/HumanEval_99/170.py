# Testing:
test_cases = [
    ("10", 10),
    ("15.3", 15),
    ("14.5", 15),
    ("-14.5", -15),
    ("17.9", 18),
    ("-17.9", -18),

    actual = closest_integer(input)
    assert actual == expected, f"For {input}, expected {expected}, got {actual}"
```

In the function, we first convert the string to a float, then to an integer to figure out the closest integer and the distance between the float and the integer.

If the distance is less than 1e-5 (effectively zero), we return the integer itself, treating the float as an integer.

If the number is positive, we return the integer `i+1` if the distance is 0.5 to round up, or `i` otherwise.

If the number is negative, we do the same but subtract 1 to round down, i.e., we return `i-1` if the distance is 0.5, and `i` otherwise.

The test cases cover different scenarios to ensure the function behaves as expected.
