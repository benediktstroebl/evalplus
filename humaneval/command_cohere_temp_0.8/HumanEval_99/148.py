```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): The input value as a string representing a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the input value.
    """
    n = float(s)
    val, inv = n, 1.0 - (n / 10) if n % 10 == 0.0 else n % 10
    return round(val if val >= 0.0 else inv)
```

The solution utilizes Python's rounding behavior, which trims away the fractional part when rounding an number to an integer. The algorithm follows these steps:
1. Convert the input string s to a float number n.
2. If `n` is an integer (i.e., it has no fractional part), return `n` as is.
3. If `n` ends with .0 (e.g., 7.0), it means it is already the closest integer, so return it as is.
4. If `n` is negative, add 10 to it to make it positive, and handle it symmetrically as in step 3.
5. The closest integer I `<= n` is the nearest integer value such that
    `n - I == 0.5`,
    so we compute `I = n - 0.5`.
    - If `I` is not an integer, it means the closest integer is `I-1`.
    - If `I` is an integer, the closest integer is `I`.
7. Handle the case when `n` is equidistant from two integers, `I` and `I+1`.
    - If `n` is closer to zero (even in floating-point sense), return `I+1`.
    - Otherwise, return `I`.

This approach guarantees that the function adheres to the "rounding away from zero" rule, ensuring that it selects the farthest integer in case of equidistance.
