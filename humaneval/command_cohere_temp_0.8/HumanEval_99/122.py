The function `closest_integer` takes a string value as input and returns the closest integer representation, adhering to the "round away from zero" rule for equidistant values. This ensures correct handling of both positive and negative equidistant numbers. It first converts the input string to a float and then to an integer to assess its current closest integer value. If the difference between the float and the closest integer is less than a very small threshold (`1e-5`), it rounds away from zero using the integer, otherwise, it simply rounds using the `round` function.
