```python
def closest_integer(s):
    '''
    Returns the closest integer to the given numeric string, rounding away from zero.
    '''
    n = float(s)
    return round(n)
```

The function `closest_integer` takes a string value as input and returns the closest integer value to the numeric value represented by the input string, consistent with the rounding direction specified in the problem statement.
