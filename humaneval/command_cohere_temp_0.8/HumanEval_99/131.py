```python
def closest_integer(s):
    '''
    Returns the closest integer to the given numeric string, rounding away from zero.
    '''
    n = float(s)
    return round(n)
```

The function `closest_integer()` takes a string value as input and returns the closest integer value to it, rounding away from zero according to the rounding rule specified in the problem statement. This rounding rule is followed in the case of decimal numbers that are equidistant from two integers. 

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```python
print(closest_integer("10"))  # Output: 10
print(closest_integer("15.3"))  # Output: 15
print(closest_integer("14.5"))  # Output: 15
print(closest_integer("-14.5"))  # Output: -15
```

The output of the example usage demonstrates the functionality of the `closest_integer()` function, rounding away from zero as specified:
```bash
10
15
15
-15
``` 

This function assumes that the input is a string that can be converted to a float value. If the input value is not a valid numeric string, the function will raise a `ValueError` during the float conversion.
