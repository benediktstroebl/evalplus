```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): The input value as a string representing a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the input value.
    """
    n = float(s)
    i = int(n)
    # Check if n is equidistant from integers and round away from zero
    if n - i == 0.5:
        return i if i >= 0 else -i
    return int(n)
```

This function takes a string s representing a number as input, converts it to a float to facilitate comparisons and rounding, and then checks if the float is equidistant from two integers. If it is, it follows the specification of rounding away from zero, ensuring that the result is the integer farther from zero. Otherwise, it simply returns the integer representation of the float. 

The test cases can be conducted using the following commands:
```python
test_cases = [
    ("10", 10),
    ("15.3", 15),
    ("14.5", 15),
    ("-14.5", -15),
    ("0", 0),
    ("-0.1", 0),
    ("1.9999", 2),
    ("-1.9999", -2),
]

for s, expected in test_cases:
    actual = closest_integer(s)
    assert actual == expected, f"For input {s}, expected {expected} but got {actual}"
```

This code will ensure that the function closest_integer behaves as expected across different input scenarios.
