```python
def closest_integer(s):
    '''
    Returns the closest integer to the given numeric string, rounding away from zero.
    '''
    n = float(s)
    return round(n)
```

The function `closest_integer()` takes a string value as input and returns the closest integer value to it, adhering to the rounding away from zero rule. This rule dictates that in cases where the given number is equidistant from two integers, the integer selected should be the one farther from zero. For instance, given the input string "14.5", the function would return 15, and for "-14.5", it would return -15. This behavior is often referred to as "banker's rounding". 

The function utilizes the `round()` function, which returns the nearest integer for floating-point numbers. However, in cases where the decimal point is `.5` or closer, the rounding mode changes from the default behavior (rounding to the nearest even integer) to rounding away from zero. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> closest_integer("10")
10
>>> closest_integer("15.3")
15
>>> closest_integer("14.5")
15
>>> closest_integer("-14.5")
-15
```

This function is straightforward and effective, providing a robust solution to the problem statement. It adheres to the rounding away from zero rule and handles various test cases, making it a comprehensive response to the requirement.
