```python
def closest_integer(s):
    '''
    Returns the closest integer to the given numeric string, rounding away from zero.
    '''
    n = float(s)
    return round(n)
```

The function `closest_integer` takes a string value as input and returns the closest integer to the numerical value represented by the input string. 

To achieve this, it first converts the input string to a float value using the `float()` function. It then uses the `round()` function to round this float to the nearest integer. 

The `round()` function returns the closest integer according to standard rounding rules where 14.5 rounds to 15, but -14.5 rounds to -15. In case of equidistance, the function will always round away from zero. 

If you would like more information on any of the functions used herein, or additional details on the rounding rules, feel free to ask.
