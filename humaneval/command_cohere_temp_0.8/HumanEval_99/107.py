```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given numeric string.
    
    Round away from zero if tied.
    """
    n = float(s)
    return round(n)
```

The function `closest_integer` takes a string value as input and returns the closest integer to the numerical value represented by the input string. The function utilizes the built-in `round` function to round the result to the nearest integer. If the number is equidistant from two integers, the function rounds away from zero, as specified in the problem statement. This behavior is consistent with the guideline that the integer value returned should be the one that is farther from zero in the case of ties. 

The `round` function takes a floating-point number and returns a rounded integer, or `float` if the rounding involves a fraction. In this specific implementation, it is recommended to initially cast the input `s` to a `float` to ensure that fractions are handled appropriately, enabling the `round` function to operate effectively. 

Please note, the code assumes that the input string `s` is a valid numeric string representation that can be converted successfully to a float number. If the input validation is a requirement, additional error handling can be incorporated to handle any non-convertible strings or invalid input types.
