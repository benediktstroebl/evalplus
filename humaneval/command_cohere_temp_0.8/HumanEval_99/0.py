```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given numeric string, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): Numeric string to be converted to an integer.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the input.
    """
    n = float(s)
    return round(n)
```

The function `closest_integer` takes a string `s` representing a number as its argument, floats back to the nearest integer using the `round()` function, and returns the result, complying with the rounding away-from-zero rule, as mentioned in the note. This algorithm provides an effortless and effective approach to transform a string representing a number into its closest integer.
