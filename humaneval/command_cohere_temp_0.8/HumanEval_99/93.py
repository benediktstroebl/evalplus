```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): The input value as a string representing a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the input value.

    n = float(s)

```

The function `closest_integer` takes a string `s` as input, representing a number, and returns the closest integer to that number. The `round` function is used to round the floating-point value `n` to the nearest integer, and the rounding away from zero rule is applied. This rule states that if the number is equidistant from two integers, the rounding up is chosen when the number is positive, and rounding down is chosen when the number is negative.
