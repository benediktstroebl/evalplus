```python
def closest_integer(s):
    '''
    Rounds the given string representation of a number to the closest
    integer, rounding away from zero if equidistant.

    Args:
        s (str): String representation of a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the given number.
    '''
    n = float(s)
    return round(n)
```

The `round` function is used to round the number to the nearest integer. In Python 3, `round` rounds away from zero as stated in the note of the problem. Therefore, there is no need for additional code to handle equidistant cases as the language default behavior already satisfies the requirement.
