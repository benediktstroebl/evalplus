```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): The value to convert to an integer.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the input value.
    """
    n = float(s)
    idx = n % 1
    if idx == 0:
        return int(n)
    elif idx < 0:
        return int(n - idx)
    else:
        return int(n + idx)
```

The function takes a string `s` as input, which represents a number, and returns the closest integer value considering the rounding away from zero rule. It first converts the input string to a float value, and then checks if the decimal portion of the float (`n % 1`) is zero. If the decimal portion is zero, it simply returns the integer value of `n`.

If the decimal portion is not zero, it further checks whether it's negative or positive. If it's negative, the function rounds down to the previous integer, which is achieved by subtracting the decimal portion and then converting to an integer using `int()`. If the decimal portion is positive, the function rounds up to the next integer, which is achieved by adding the decimal portion and then converting to an integer.

The approach ensures that the function always rounds away from zero as specified in the problem statement. For example, for the input "14.5", the function returns 15, and for the input "-14.5", it returns -15.
