```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): The input value as a string representing a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the input value.
    """
    n = float(s)
    i = int(n)
    delta = abs(n - i)
    if delta < 1e-6:
        return i
    elif n > i:
        return i + 1
    else:
        return i - 1
```

The function takes a string `s` as input, representing a number, and follows the mandate to return the closest integer value. It first converts the string to a float and then to an integer. It then calculates the absolute difference between the float and the integer values. If the difference is miniscule (`<1e-6`), it returns the integer value. If the float value is greater than the integer, it returns the integer augmented by 1, effectively rounding up. Conversely, if the float is smaller than the integer, it returns the integer minus 1, rounding down. This rounding strategy is in line with the problem's note about equidistant values, always rounding away from zero.
