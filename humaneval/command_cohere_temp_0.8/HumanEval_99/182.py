```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): The input value as a string representing a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the input value.
    """
    n = float(s)
    i = int(n)
    if n - i == 0:
        return i
    elif n - i > 0:
        return i + 1
    else:
        return i - 1
```

The function takes a string s as input and first converts it to a float n,
then to an integer i. If the difference between n and i is 0, it means
the number is already an integer, so it returns i. If n is closer to
i + 1, it returns i + 1, and if n is closer to i - 1, it returns i - 1. 

This algorithm guarantees that the function always rounds away from zero. 

The provided documentation explains the function's purpose, arguments,
and return values.
