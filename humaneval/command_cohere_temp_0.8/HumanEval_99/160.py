```python

    Return the closest integer to the given numeric string, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): Numeric string representing a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the input number.
    """
    # Remove trailing zeros and decimal points
    s = re.sub(r'[.\d]*0$', '', s)
    # Allow explicit rounding
    if s.endswith('Infinity'):
        return int(s[:-9])
    # Check for invalid strings
    if not s.isdigit():

```

The function takes a string `s` as input, which represents a number, and returns
the closest integer according to the rounding rule of rounding away from zero.
The `re.sub` function is used to remove trailing zeros and decimal points
from the input string, ensuring that the decimal point is the last character.
If the input ends with `Infinity`, it is explicitly rounded to the nearest integer.
If the input is not a valid digit string, it raises a `ValueError`. 
Finally, the function converts the string to a float, and rounds it using `round`
with a precision of 0, which rounds the float to the nearest integer,
using the rounding rule of rounding away from zero.

The following imports are necessary to round the decimal value:
```python
from re import sub
from math import round
```

This function handles both positive and negative numbers, as well as
different input formats, such as plain integers, decimal numbers, and
inputs with trailing zeros or decimal points. 

This function can be used as a standalone function in other projects
to round values to the closest integer according to specific rounding rules.
