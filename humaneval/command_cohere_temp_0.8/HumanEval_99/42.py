```python
def closest_integer(s):
    '''
    Rounds the given string representation of a number to the closest
    integer, rounding away from zero if equidistant.

    Args:
        s (str): Number string to be rounded.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the input number.
    '''
    n = float(s)
    return round(n)
```

The function `closest_integer` takes a string representation of a number (`s`) as its input, converts it to a float to allow for decimal values, and then uses the `round` function to round it to the nearest integer. If the number is equidistant from two integers, it follows the note in the problem statement and rounds away from zero.

To ensure correct handling of various input cases, you might consider adding test cases for edge scenarios, such as negative numbers, already-integer-represented values, and values close to integral boundaries. These tests would ensure that the function is correctly implementing the rounding strategy and meeting requirements.
