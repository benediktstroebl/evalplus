```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): The input value as a string representing a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the input value.
    """
    n = float(s)
    # Check if the number is equidistant from two integers
    # and round it away from zero
    if n % 1 == 0.5:
        return round(n)
    return int(n)
```

This function `closest_integer(s)` takes a string `s` representing a number and returns the closest integer to it, according to the problem's requirements of rounding away from zero in cases of equidistance. It first converts the input string to a float, then checks if the number is equidistant from two integers using the condition `n % 1 == 0.5`, and accordingly rounds it to the closest integer while maintaining the rounding away from zero rule.

The tests for this function can be done simply by calling it with a few input values and comparing the results to the expected output, as shown below:
```python
# Testing the function
assert closest_integer("10") == 10
assert closest_integer("15.3") == 15
assert closest_integer("14.5") == 15
assert closest_integer("-14.5") == -15
``` 

This would ensure that the function `closest_integer(s)` correctly implements the rounding rule and provides the desired output for the given inputs.
