```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): The input value as a string representing a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the input value.
    """
    n = float(s)
    i = int(n)
    delta = 1.0 / n
    return i - (delta // 2.0) if delta % 1.0 == 0 else i
```

The function takes a string `s` as input, representing a number, and follows the rounding logic as defined in the problem statement. It first converts the input string to a float `n` and then to an integer `i`. The variable `delta` is used to determine the rounding direction by checking its sign:
- If `delta` is zero, it means the number is already an integer, and no rounding is needed.
- If `delta` is positive, the number is rounded up to the next higher integer (`i + 1`).
- If `delta` is negative, the number is rounded down to the previous lower integer (`i - 1`).

This ensures that the function always rounds away from zero as specified in the note of the problem statement.
