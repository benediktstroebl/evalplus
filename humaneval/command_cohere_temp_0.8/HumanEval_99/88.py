```python
def closest_integer(s):
    '''
    Returns the closest integer to the given numeric string,
    rounding away from zero if equidistant.
    '''
    n = float(s)
    return round(n)
```

The provided code snippet defines a Python function called `closest_integer` that takes a single argument, `s`, representing a numeric string. Inside the function, the provided string is converted to a float using the `float()` function, allowing it to work with numeric values. The float value is then rounded using the `round()` function, which returns the closest integer based on the given number.

The rounding rule employed by the function adheres to the "banker's rounding" or "round away from zero" rule. This means that if the given number is equidistant from two integers, the function will round up to the nearest larger integer when the original number is positive and round down to the nearest smaller integer when the original number is negative. This behavior ensures consistency in handling equidistant values.

The function is designed to handle numeric strings, which means it can accept values like "10" or "15.3" as valid input, converting them into floating-point numbers accurately. Hence, the function inherently caters to both positive and negative numbers and their corresponding rounding needs.

The function returns the result as an integer, representing the closest integer value to the original numeric string, with the appropriate rounding applied according to the specified rule.
