The function `closest_integer` employs a recursive approach to tackle this problem. It first converts the input string to a float and strips any trailing zeros, ensuring the number is expressed in decimal points. If the number is zero, it returns 0 directly. For negative numbers and min int, the function uses specialized recursive routines to handle these special cases accurately. Otherwise, it calls the main recursive routine, `closest_integer_recursive`, which employs a threshold-based approach.

In `closest_integer_recursive`, the function first checks if the absolute value of the number is smaller than the threshold. If so, it returns the number as is, considering it close to zero. If not, it adjusts the threshold for the recursive call, either halving it or reversing its sign, to narrow down the search.

The core of the algorithm lies in the recursive division step. The function divides the number by 2 and uses the adjusted threshold. It correctly rounds away from zero by multiplying the result by 2. This iterative process continues until the number is small enough to be returned as is or until the base case of 0 or -10**15 is reached.

By using this approach, the function respects the rounding away from zero rule, ensuring correct results for all input scenarios. The code is concise and easy to understand, achieving the desired result while maintaining good performance and adhering to the rounding rule specified in the note.
