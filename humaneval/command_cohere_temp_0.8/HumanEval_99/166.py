```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): The input value as a string representing a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the input value.

    n = float(s)
    zero_cutoff = 0.5
    return round(n / zero_cutoff) * zero_cutoff
```

The approach designed here is to determine the nearest integer value by dividing the float value by `0.5` (trickiest at `0.5`). Next, we use rounding to ensure the nearest integer is allocated to it. Ultimately, we multiply the outcome by `0.5` to restore the original value. By using this approach, the decimal point is moved only a decimal place away, resulting in the correct rounding behavior when equidistant from two integers.
