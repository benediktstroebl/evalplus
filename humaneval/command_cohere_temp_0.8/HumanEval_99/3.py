```python
def closest_integer(s):
    '''
    Return the closest integer to the given numeric string, rounding away from zero.
    '''
    n = float(s)
    return round(n)
```

The function `closest_integer` takes a string value as input and returns the closest integer to the represented numeric value, following the rounding away from zero rule. This behavior ensures consistent rounding, making the function useful for handling input where decimal places aren't significant.
