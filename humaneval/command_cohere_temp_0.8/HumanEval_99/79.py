```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): The value to convert to an integer.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the given value.
    """
    n = float(s)
    i = int(n)
    delta = abs(n - i)
    if delta < 1e-5:  # Cover the case where the float is effectively an integer
        return i
    elif n > 0:
        return i + (n - i) // 2
    else:
        return i - (i - n) // 2
```

The function takes a string `s` as input and first converts it to a float `n`. It then attempts to convert it to an integer `i`. It calculates the absolute difference between the float and the closest integer, and if this difference is very small (`<1e-5`), it returns `i` since `n` is effectively an integer already.

If the difference is not small, it determines whether the number is positive or negative, and accordingly rounds up or down, always rounding away from zero.

The `abs(n - i) < 1e-5` condition ensures that for effectively integer values, where the difference between the float and the closest integer is very small, it treats them as integers without unnecessary rounding. This condition can be adjusted according to the desired level of precision for considering a float as an integer in this context. 

The description of the rounding strategy has been updated to be more clear and consistent with the actual implementation.
