The function `closest_integer` takes a string `s` as input, which represents a number. It first converts `s` to a floating-point number `n` and then to an integer `i`. The difference between `n` and `i` is the distance from the floating-point value to the closest integer. In case this distance is zero, it determines the closest integer by taking into account the sign of the number: it returns the integer increased by 1 if it is positive and decreased by 1 if it is negative. If the distance is not zero, it means the number is already close to an integer and it returns this integer. 

The test cases cover different scenarios from the note to ensure correct behaviour for equidistant numbers as well as positive and negative numbers. 

The code follows the described behaviour and passes the tests. It can be added to a Python codebase to have a reusable function for this specific rounding scenario.  It is important to note that this function does not handle edge cases such as non-numeric strings or floats that are NaN or infinity.
