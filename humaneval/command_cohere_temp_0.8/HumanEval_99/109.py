```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given numeric string, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): Numeric string representing a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the input number.
    """
    n = float(s)
    return round(n)
```

The function `closest_integer` takes a string representation of a number as input and returns the closest integer value, rounding away from zero according to the rounding rule specified in the note. This behavior ensures consistency and complies with the specified rule for equidistant values.
