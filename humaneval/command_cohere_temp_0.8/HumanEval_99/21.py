```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): The input value as a string representing a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the input value.
    """
    n = float(s)
    return round(n)
```

The function takes a string `s` as input, converts it to a float, and then uses the `round` function to round it to the nearest integer. The `round` function rounds a number to the nearest integer, taking the decimal value into account. If the number is equidistant from two integers, it rounds away from zero, as specified in the note. This behavior ensures that the function always returns the integer that is farther from zero, providing the correct result for equidistant inputs such as "14.5" or "-14.5", which should return 15 and -15, respectively.
