```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): A string representing a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the given value.
    """
    n = float(s)
    i = int(n)
    near_zero = abs(n - i) < 1e-5 and n > 0 or abs(n - i) < 1e-5 and n < 0  # Check for equidistance from zero
    if near_zero:
        return i + 1 if n > 0 else i - 1
    return int(n)
```

The function starts by casting the string to a float and then to an integer `n`. It then checks if the difference between the float `n` and the integer `i` is really small (`<1e-5`), and the number is not zero, to determine if it is equidistant from some integer and needs to round away from zero. If that is the case, it returns `i+1` if `n` is positive or `i-1` if `n` is negative. If not, it simply returns `int(n)`, as the rounding away from zero would have already been done. 

The expected behavior for the given examples is:
```python
>> closest_integer("10")
10
>> closest_integer("15.3")
15
>> closest_integer("14.5")
15
>> closest_integer("-14.5")
-15
``` 

The provided examples test the various conditions outlined in the problem statement, including equidistant floating points near zero and away from zero.
