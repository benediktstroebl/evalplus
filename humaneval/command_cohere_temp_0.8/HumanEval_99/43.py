    n = float(s)
    ix = int(n)  # Ignore the decimal part when comparing absolute difference
    ny = n - ix  # Calculate the difference between the given number and the closest integer
    if abs(ny) == 0.5:  # If the number is equidistant from two integers

```

The function `closest_integer` takes a string `s` as input, representing a number, and returns the closest integer according to the given rounding rule. It first converts the input to a float and calculates the difference between the given number and the closest integer, using `ix` to refer to the closest integer.

If the absolute difference `abs(ny)` is exactly 0.5, it means the number is equidistant from two integers, so it rounds the number away from zero using the `round` function. This ensures that when the input is exactly equidistant, the larger integer is chosen.

If the absolute difference is not exactly 0.5, it returns the closest integer (`ix`) directly, as it is already guaranteed to be the closest integer to the given value.

This approach avoids potential floating-point precision issues and follows the specified rounding rule. Test cases can be added to ensure correct behavior for edge cases and negative numbers.
