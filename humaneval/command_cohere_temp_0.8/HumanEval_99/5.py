```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): The input value as a string representing a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the input value.
    """
    n = float(s)
    return round(n)
```

The function `closest_integer` takes a string `s` as input, converts it to a float, and then uses the `round` function to round it to the nearest integer. The `round` function's default behavior is to round away from zero, as stated in the note of the problem statement. Therefore, if the input value is equidistant from two integers, the function will always round up or down farthest from zero, depending on whether the number is positive or negative.
