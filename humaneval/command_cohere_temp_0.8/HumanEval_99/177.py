```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): A string representing a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the given value.
    """
    n = float(s)
    integer_part = int(n)
    fractional_part = n - integer_part

    if fractional_part == 0:
        return integer_part
    elif fractional_part > 0:
        return integer_part + 1
    else:
        return integer_part - 1
```

The function `closest_integer` uses integer conversion to determine the `integer_part` and fractional part of the number. If the fractional part is greater than 0 or less than 0, it means that the number is closest to the adjacent higher or lower integer value, respectively. Consequently, the function returns the closest integer value accordingly. 

This approach guarantees that the function adheres to the "rounding away from zero" rule, as specified in the problem statement.
