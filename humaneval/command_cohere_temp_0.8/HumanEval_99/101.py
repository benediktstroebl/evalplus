The function `closest_integer` takes a string `s` as input, which represents a number, and returns the closest integer to that number. It first converts the input string to a float and then to an integer. If the floating-point value is equal to the integer, it returns a rounded version of the float that is rounded away from zero. This is done to cover both positive and negative cases and is illustrated in the note of the provided problem. It ensures that the code follows the requirement of always rounding away from zero when the number is equidistant from two integers.
