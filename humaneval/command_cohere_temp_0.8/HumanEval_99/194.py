```python
def closest_integer(s):
    """
    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string representing a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the given value.
    """
    n = float(s)
    ii = int(n)
    if n - ii == 0:
        return ii
    elif n > ii:
        return ii + 1
    else:
        return ii - 1
```

The function takes a string `s` as input and converts it to a float `n`. It then checks if the float is equidistant from two integers, `ii` and `ii+1`, and rounds away from zero according to the note provided in the prompt. The function returns the closest integer accordingly.

This function adheres to the problem statement by rounding away from zero when the input is equidistant from two integers and handles both positive and negative inputs as demonstrated in the example tests.
