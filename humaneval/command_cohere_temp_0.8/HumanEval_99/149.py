```python
def closest_integer(s):
    '''
    Return the closest integer to the given value, rounding away from zero.

    Args:
        s (str): A string representing a number.

    Returns:
        int: The closest integer to the given value.
    '''
    n = float(s)
    diff_from_zero = abs(n) - abs(round(n))
    if diff_from_zero == 0.5:
        return round(n)
    elif diff_from_zero > 0.5:
        return round(n)
    else:
        return round(n) - 1
```

The function takes a string `s` as input, representing a number, and operates as follows:
1. It converts the input string `s` to a float `n`.
2. It calculates the difference between the absolute value of `n` and the absolute value of rounding `n` to the nearest integer. This difference is used to determine whether rounding up or down is required.
3. If the difference is `0.5`, it simply rounds `n` to the nearest integer.
4. If the difference is greater than `0.5`, it rounds `n` up to the nearest integer.
5. If the difference is less than `0.5`, it rounds `n` down to the nearest integer and then subtracts `1` from the result to ensure rounding away from zero.

The script ensures that the rounding behavior follows the requirement of rounding away from zero while producing the closest integer value for a given input.
