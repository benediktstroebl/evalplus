```python
def closest_integer(s):
    '''
    Returns the closest integer to the given numeric string, rounding away from zero.
    '''
    n = float(s)
    return round(n)
```

The function `closest_integer` takes a string value as input and returns the closest integer value to it, rounding away from zero according to the rounding rules specified in the problem statement. This is achieved through the use of the `round` function in Python which rounds the floating point value `n` to the nearest integer based on the current rounding mode.

Here are some examples of how the function works when taking different input values:
```python
>>> closest_integer("10")
10
>>> closest_integer("15.3")
15
>>> closest_integer("14.5")
15
>>> closest_integer("-14.5")
-15
```

This implementation follows the note mentioned in the provided problem statement, where "rounding away from zero" means that the function should round towards the nearest integer that is farthest from zero.
