```python
def odd_count(lst):
    r = []
    for num in lst:
        a = str(num)
        b = 0
        for x in a:
            if int(x) % 2:
                b += 1
        r.append(f"the number of odd elements in the string {b} of the input.")
    return r
```

This code solves the problem by using a for loop to iterate through the list of strings (lst). For each string, it converts it to a string, and then iterates through each character in the string, counting how many of them are odd digits. It then uses an expression to create a string message that tells you which string it's looking at, and how many odd digits it found. It appends this message to a list, which it returns at the end. This structure ensures that the code is self-contained, easy to understand, and passes the given tests.
