```python
def odd_count(strings):
    r = []
    for string in strings:
        counts = str(sum(1 for c in string if c % 2 == 1))
        r.append(f"the number of odd elements {counts} in the string {string} of the input.")
    return r
```

This code solves the problem by using a sum function in combination with a generator expression to count the odd digits in each string in the list of strings. Then, it uses an f-string to create the output string with the placeholder replaced by the count of odd digits. Finally, it returns the list of strings with the problem asks for. Overall the code uses Python idioms and operations to quickly solve the problem. 

This solution will be improved upon in the following ways:
- **Variable Naming**: The variable name `r` is not descriptive, and it would be preferable to instead name it with a more meaningful name that indicates its purpose. 
- **String Slicing**: The code doesn't need string slicing, whereas the `sum()` function and a generator expression are adequately handling the counting of odd digits.

These are more refined adjustments to the code for better readability and understanding. Let me know if you'd like to know more about any of these techniques or any others that might be applicable to this problem!
