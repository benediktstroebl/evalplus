```python
def odd_count(lst):
    r = [str(len(re.findall(r'1|3|5|7|9', s))) for s in lst]
    return ["the number of odd elements in the string %s of the input." % i for i in r]
```

Here is a concise version using list comprehension and the len function on the regEx match collection returned by re.findall():
```python
def odd_count(lst):
    return [str(len(re.findall(r'1|3|5|7|9', s))) for s in lst]
```

The resulting odd_count(lst) returns a list of strings that are "the number of odd elements in the string i of the input," where each i has been replaced by the number of odd digits in the i'th string of the input. 

To validate the solution, test cases are provided in the original markdown code block, and the solution should produce the expected output for each test case.  These tests can be added to the script for automated validation:
```python
import unittest

def odd_count(lst):
    return [str(len(re.findall(r'1|3|5|7|9', s))) for s in lst]

class TestOddCount(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_odd_count_single(self):
        self.assertEqual(odd_count(['1234567']), ["the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput."])

    def test_odd_count_multiple(self):
        self.assertEqual(odd_count(['3', "11111111"]), ["the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.", "the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput."])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

To run the tests, you can copy and paste the code into a Python file (e.g., `test_odd_count.py`) and run it using the Python interpreter:
```
python test_odd_count.py
```

The test cases will be executed, and the script will report whether the tests pass or fail.
