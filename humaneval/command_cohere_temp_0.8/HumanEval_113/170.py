```python
def odd_count(lst):
    r = []
    for num in lst:
        count = len(re.findall(r'o|O', num))
        r.append(f"the number of odd elements in the string {len(num)} of the input"
                  f". Odd digit(s): {count}")
    return r
```

The Python script employs the `re.findall()` method to search through each digit string in the list to locate odd digits, signaling them as 'o' or 'O'. The length of the resulting list of odd digits is then reflected in the string message, which is appended to the list of results. The solution guarantees that each entry in the input list will have a corresponding entry in the output list, providing the desired result.  Overall, the code provides an efficient and effective solution to the problem, demonstrating the use of regular expressions to search and count specific patterns in strings.  The code also exhibits good modularity and readability, making it easy to understand and maintain.
