```python
def odd_count(strings):
    r = []
    for string in strings:
        odd = sum(1 for c in string if c % 2 != 0)
        r.append(f"the number of odd elements {odd}n the str{len(string)}ng {string} of the input.")
    return r
```

This code uses the same approach as the provided examples. It iterates through each string, counts the number of odd digits using a generator expression, and constructs the appropriate output string. The function is self-contained and does not rely on any external variables or dependencies. When you call `odd_count(lst)`, it will return a list of strings as described in the problem statement.
