```python
def odd_count(lst):
    r = []
    for i, s in enumerate(lst, 1):
        n = sum(1 for c in s if c % 2 == 1)
        r.append(f"the number of odd elements in the string {i} of the input is {n}")
    return r
```

The function uses a nested loop where the outer loop enumerates the list index `i` and the inner loop uses a generator expression to count the odd digits in the string `s`. The result is formatted into a natural language string and added to the `r` list. The final return is the `r` list of strings.

This solution allows for a single iteration over the input list, directly producing the output list of strings. It also uses a generator expression, which is the most efficient solution for this problem. 

The problem is to count the number of odd digits in each string in a list of strings, and then report it in a natural language form. The solution provided does this in a self-contained manner, where the functionality is encapsulated in a single function. The output also retains the original indexing of the input list, making it easy to align with the input.
