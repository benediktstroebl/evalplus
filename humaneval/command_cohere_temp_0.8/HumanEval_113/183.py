```python
def odd_count(lst):
    r = []
    for digits in lst:
        counts = str(sum(1 for c in digits if c % 2 != 0))
        r.append(f"the number of odd elements in the string {counts} of the input")
    return r
```

This solution uses a simple loop to iterate through each string in the list and calculate the count of odd digits in each string. The resulting counts are appended to the result list after being formatted into a string, and the final result is returned.

To display the functioning of the provided solution, tests are provided that are similar to the ones provided in the problem statement:
```python
def test_odd_count():
    # Simple test case
    assert odd_count(['1234567']) == ["the number of odd elements in the string 4 of the input"]

    # Test case with a list of strings
    assert odd_count(['3', "11111111"]) == ["the number of odd elements in the string 1 of the input", "the number of odd elements in the string 8 of the input"]

    # Test case with a string containing only odd digits
    assert odd_count(['13579']) == ["the number of odd elements in the string 1 of the input"]

    # Test case with an empty list
    assert odd_count([]) == []

test_odd_count()
```
The test suite will execute the `odd_count` function with the input scenarios and compare the returned results against the expected outputs.
