```python
def odd_count(lst):
    r = []
    for digits in lst:
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(digits)):
            if int(digits[i]) % 2:
                count += 1
        r.append(f"the number of odd elements in the string {count} of the input")
    return r
```

The code uses a simple loop to iterate through each string in the list and counts the number of odd digits in each string. Then it replicates the string 'input' as directed by the problem statement and substitutes in the counting digit. 

The tests provided match the output of the function with the expected list of strings. For instance, the first test case returns the string "the number of odd elements in the string 4 of the input", which is what the function outputs when it is given the list of strings ['1234567']. 

This code efficiently solves the problem and matches the solution performance of theSolution.
