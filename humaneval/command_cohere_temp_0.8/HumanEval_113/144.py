```python
def odd_count(lst):
    r = []
    for digits in lst:
        count = 0
        for d in digits:
            if d % 2:
                count += 1
        r.append(f"the number of odd elements in the string {count} of the input")
    return r
```

This code solves the problem by taking an list of list of digits and creates a list of corresponding string descriptions, as required by the problem statement, using a nested loop structure to calculate the odd digit count, then appropriately formats the string description with the required placeholder. 

To execute the code and run the tests, please execute the following code:
```python
# Import the unit testing framework
from unittest import TestCase, main

# Define a test case class
class TestOddCount(TestCase):
    # Define a set of test cases
    def test_odd_count(self):
        # Test with a simple list of strings consisting only of digits
        assert odd_count(['1234567']) == ['the number of odd elements in the string 4 of the input']

        # Test with a list of strings consisting only of digits, with various lengths
        assert odd_count(['3', '11111111']) == ['the number of odd elements in the string 1 of the input', 'the number of odd elements in the string 8 of the input']

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This will run the test case defined above against the `odd_count` function, as outlined in the code snippet. 
If the output does not include a `FAILED` statement, this means that the test case has passed and the code works as intended.
