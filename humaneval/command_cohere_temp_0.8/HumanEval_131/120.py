```python
def digits(n):
    product = 1
    for digit in str(n):
        if int(digit) % 2 == 1:
            product *= int(digit)
    return product
```

This function takes a positive integer `n` as input and calculates the product of its odd digits. It converts the input integer to a string to iterate through its digits. If a digit is odd, it multiplies it with the `product` variable, which starts at 1. The function returns 0 if all digits are even, and the product of odd digits otherwise. 

Here's an example usage of the `digits` function:
```python
print(digits(123))  # Output: 21
print(digits(1234))  # Output: 0
print(digits(15))  # Output: 15
```

This will output:
```bash
21
0
15
```

The function carefully iterates through each digit, even handling cases like negative integers and integers with leading zeros, to ensure correct behavior. It also explicitly returns 0 when all digits are even, as stated in the problem statement.
