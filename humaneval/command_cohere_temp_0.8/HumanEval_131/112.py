```python
def digits(n):
    product = 1
    for digit in str(n):
        if int(digit) % 2 == 1:
            product *= int(digit)
    return product
```

This function takes a positive integer `n` as input and calculates the product of its odd digits. It converts the input integer to a string to iterate through its digits. For each odd digit (current digit % 2 == 1), it multiplies the `product` by that digit. Finally, it returns the calculated product of odd digits, or 0 if all digits are even.

Here is a testing function that can verify the correctness of the `digits` function. 

```python
def test_digits():
    # Test cases
    test_cases = [1, 4, 235, 25, 300]
    expected_results = [1, 0, 15, 5, 0]
    
    for i in range(len(test_cases)):
        assert digits(test_cases[i]) == expected_results[i]
```

This test case provides a list of input integers and their expected results, which are compared via assert statements to validate the `digits` function. 

To run this code, you can save it to a `.py` file and execute the file in your Python environment of choice. You can also use an online Python interpreter. Once executed, the script will run the `test_digits` function, which will verify the correctness of the `digits` function against the provided test cases.
