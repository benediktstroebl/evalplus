```python
def digits(n):
    """Return the product of the odd digits in the integer n."""
    result = 0
    for digit in str(n):
        if int(digit) % 2 == 1: 
            result *= int(digit)
    return result if result else 0
```

This Python script defines a function called `digits` that takes in one positive integer `n` as input. It iterates through each digit in the decimal representation of `n` and checks if each digit is odd or even. If the digit is odd, it multiplies it with the `result` variable, which should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts and is meant to store the final result. If all digits are even, the function returns 0. The function ultimately returns the product of only the odd digits, or 0 if all digits are even. 

The function's docstring includes a summary of what the function does, as well as example inputs and their corresponding outputs to clarify its behavior.
