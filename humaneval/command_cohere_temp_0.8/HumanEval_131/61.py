```python
def digits(n):
    prod = 1
    for digit in str(n):
        if int(digit) % 2:
            prod *= int(digit)
    return prod
```

This problem can be solved by iterating through each digit in the integer `n` and multiplying each odd digit found by the `prod` variable, initially set to 1. The loop terminates when the variable `prod` equals 0, as this is the product of all the odd digits of `n`, or when there are no more digits to iterate through. Ultimately, this solution leverages Python's built-in conversion and modular arithmetic properties, making the code succinct and efficient. 

This approach allows the solution to elegantly handle different input types and end the iteration process once a product is determined.
