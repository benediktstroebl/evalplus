```python
def digits(n):
    prod = 1
    for digit in str(n):
        if int(digit) % 2 == 1:
            prod *= int(digit)
    return prod
```

This `digits` function iterates through each digit in the decimal representation of the given number `n`. It multiplies the odd digits together, contributing to the `prod` variable. Even digits are ignored as they don't contribute to the product. The function returns the final value of `prod`, which will be 0 if all digits are even, and the correct product otherwise. 

This solution focuses on simplicity and efficiency, making just one pass through the input and avoiding any unnecessary computations. It offers a clear and direct approach to solving the given problem. 

To see the solution in action, you can execute the following code, which includes a test case:
```python
# Test the solution
n = 235
expected_result = 15

product = digits(n)

print(f"The product of the odd digits of {n} is: {product}")
assert product == expected_result
``` 
This demonstrates the validity of the function against an exemplar integer.
