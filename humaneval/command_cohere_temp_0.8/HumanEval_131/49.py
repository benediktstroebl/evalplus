```python
def digits(n):
    prod = 1
    for digit in str(n):
        if int(digit) % 2:
            prod *= int(digit)
    return prod
```

This problem can be solved by multiplying the odd digits in the integer representation of `n`. The self-contained Python script defines a function called `digits` that takes in a positive integer `n` as an argument and returns the product of the odd digits in `n`. It initializes a variable `prod` to 1, which will be used to accumulate the product of the odd digits. Then it loops through each digit in the string representation of `n` using a for loop and checks if each digit is odd using the modulo operator %. If the digit is odd, it multiplies the `prod` by the integer value of that particular digit. Finally, the function returns the value of `prod` which would be the product of the odd digits in `n`. 

For example, for the input `5`, the function will return `5` since there is only one digit and it is odd. For the input `2356`, the function will return `189` since all the digits are even and the product will be `1 * 2 * 4 * 6` = `189`.
