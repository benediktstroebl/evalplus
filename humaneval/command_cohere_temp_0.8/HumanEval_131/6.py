```python
def digits(n):
    product = 1
    for digit in str(n):
        if int(digit) % 2 == 1:
            product *= int(digit)
    return product
```

This function takes a positive integer `n` as input and calculates the product of its odd digits. It converts the input number to a string to iterate through its digits. For each odd digit (where `int(digit) % 2 == 1` is true), it multiplies the `product` variable by that digit. Finally, it returns the calculated product of odd digits, or 0 if all digits are even (i.e., when the input is an even number). 

The problem is tested with the following inputs and expected outputs:
```
digits(1)  == 1
digits(4)  == 0
digits(235) == 15
```
