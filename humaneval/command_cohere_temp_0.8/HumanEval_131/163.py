```python
def digits(n):
    prod = 1
    for digit in str(n):
        if int(digit) % 2:
            prod *= int(digit)
    return prod
```

This Python script defines a function called `digits` that takes in a positive integer as an argument and calculates the product of its odd digits. The function first initializes a variable `prod` to 1, which will be used to accumulate the product of odd digits. Then, it iterates through each digit in the decimal representation of the input number `n`, extracting each digit as a string from the left, checking if the digit is odd using the modulo operator (`int(digit) % 2`), and multiplying the `prod` value by the odd digit int value. Finally, the function returns the value of `prod`, which gives the product of the odd digits of the input number.

This solution adheres to the problem's requirement that the function returns 0 if all digits are even, and correctly handles positive integers as inputs.
