```python
def digits(n):
    prod = 1
    for digit in str(n):
        if int(digit) % 2 == 1:
            prod *= int(digit)
    return prod
```

This Python script defines a function named `digits` that takes in a positive integer as an argument and calculates the product of its odd digits. The function first initializes a variable `prod` to 1, which will be used to accumulate the product of odd digits. It then iterates through each digit in the decimal representation of the input number, checking if each digit is odd using the modulo operator (`int(digit) % 2 == 1`). If an odd digit is found, it multiplies the `prod` by that digit. Finally, the function returns the value of `prod`, which will be 0 if all digits are even and the product of odd digits otherwise. 

The TDD approach ensures that the code grows to meet the specific requirements of the problem statement, adhering to the principle of "coding for tests, not for screens." It's a way to ensure that the code is developed in small, manageable steps while maintaining focus on the desired behavior, which is essential for long-term code maintainability and reducing the risk of bugs. 

You can use this code by calling the `digits` function with a positive integer as an argument, and it will return the product of the odd digits for that number.  If all digits are even, it will return 0. You can embed this code inside a markdown code block by copying and pasting this code into your Markdown file.
