```python
def digits(n):
    prod = 1
    for digit in str(n):
        if int(digit) % 2:
            prod *= int(digit)
    return prod
```

This problem can be solved by converting the input n into a string to iterate over each digit. We then check if each digit is odd or even, multiplying the odd digits and storing the result in the prod variable. The final result will be the product of all odd digits in the case where n is a positive integer. 

This solution makes use of Python's built-in str and int functions for easy conversion between string and integer types, leveraging the modulo operator (%) to check if a number is odd or even. 

To verify the correctness of the code, a test suite can be created to cover different cases, ensuring that the code works consistently and accurately.
