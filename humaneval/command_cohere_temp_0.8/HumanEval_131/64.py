```python
def digits(n):
    product = 1
    for digit in str(n):
        if int(digit) % 2 == 1:
            product *= int(digit)
    return product
```

This script defines a function `digits` that takes an integer argument and returns the product of the odd digits in the integer. The function first initializes a variable `product` to 1, then iterates through each digit in the string representation of the integer `n`. If the digit is odd (i.e., its value is not divisible by 2), it multiplies the `product` by the digit.

The function returns 0 if all digits are even, considering that 0 is an even number. And this behavior aligns with the problem statement's specifications.

The TDD approach to testing this function could involve creating a test case for each scenario mentioned in the problem statement, ensuring edge cases are considered, and potentially exploring further to ensure robustness.
