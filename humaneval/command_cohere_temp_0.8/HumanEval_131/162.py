```python
def digits(n):
    product = 1
    for digit in str(n):
        if int(digit) % 2 == 1:
            product *= int(digit)
    return product
```

This Python script defines a function called `digits` that takes in a positive integer as an argument and calculates the product of its odd digits. The function first initializes a variable called `product` to 1, which will be used to accumulate the product of odd digits. Then, it iterates through each digit in the decimal representation of the input number `n` and checks if the digit, when converted to an integer, is odd using the modulo operator (`%`). If the digit is odd, it multiplies it by the `product` gradually building the result. Finally, the function returns the value of the `product` which is the product of the odd digits of the input number. 

The markdown code block includes a docstring that describes the purpose of the code and provides example inputs and outputs to illustrate how the function works, including tests that verify the correctness of the implementation.
