```python
def digits(n):
    prod = 1
    for digit in str(n):
        if int(digit) % 2 == 1:
            prod *= int(digit)
    return prod
```

This `digits` function iterates through each digit in the decimal representation of the given number `n`. It employs a `product` variable to keep track of the product of odd digits. For each odd digit, it multiplies the `product` by the odd digit. In contrast, if all digits are even, the function returns 0 since the product of odd digits will remain 0. 

Here is a sample output of the function:
```
digits(1)  == 1
digits(4)  == 0
digits(235) == 15
```

This example output demonstrates that the function correctly solves the problem statement.
