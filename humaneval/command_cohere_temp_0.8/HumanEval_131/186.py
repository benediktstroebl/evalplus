```python
def digits(n):
    prod = 1
    for digit in str(n):
        if int(digit) % 2:
            prod *= int(digit)
    return prod
```

This function takes a positive integer `n` as input and calculates the product of its odd digits. It converts the input number to a string to iterate through its digits. For each digit, if it is odd, the code multiplies it with the `prod` variable, which should be initially 1 and is used to accumulate the product of odd digits. Finally, the function returns 0 if all digits are even, and the product of odd digits otherwise.
