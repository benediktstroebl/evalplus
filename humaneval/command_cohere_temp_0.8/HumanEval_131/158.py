```python
def digits(n):
    product = 1
    for digit in str(n):
        if int(digit) % 2 == 1:
            product *= int(digit)
    return product
```

This Python script defines a function called `digits` that takes in a positive integer as an argument and calculates the product of its odd digits. The function first initializes a variable called `product` to 1, which will be used to accumulate the product of odd digits. Then, it iterates through each digit in the decimal representation of the input number, checking if each digit is odd using the modulo operator (`int(digit) % 2 == 1`). If the digit is odd, it multiplies it by the `product`, updating it accordingly. Finally, the function returns the value of the `product` accumulator, which gives the product of the odd digits in the input number. 

The markdown code block illustrates a unit test in Python using the `unittest` module to verify the correctness of the `digits` function. It defines a test class called `TestDigits` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. Inside this class, a test method called `testDigits` is defined, which contains two test cases:
1. `digits(1)`: This tests the function with an input of 1 and expects the output to be 1, as the singular digit of 1 should yield a product of 1 (since odd digits multiply to 1).
2. `digits(235):` This tests the function with an input of 235 and expects the output to be 15, as it should multiply the odd digits (5 and 3) in the input. 

To execute the test, the `unittest` module is imported, and the `main()` function is used to run the tests.
