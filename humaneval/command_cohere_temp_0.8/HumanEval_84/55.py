Here's a Python script that contains a function which solves the given problem and is compatible with the specified markdown code block:
```python
def solve(n):
    s = str(n)
    return bin(sum(int(d) for d in s))[2:].zfill(len(s))
```
This function takes a positive integer `n` as its input and converts it into a string `s`. It then iterates through each digit in the string and converts it to an integer. The sum of these integers is calculated and then converted to a binary string. This binary string is returned, right-padded with zeros to ensure it has the same length as the input number's string representation. This approach ensures a valid binary string representation of the sum of the digits in binary.
