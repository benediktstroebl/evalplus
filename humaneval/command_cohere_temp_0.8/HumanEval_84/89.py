Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the given problem:
```python
def solve(N):
    """Returns the sum of digits in binary representation of the given integer N."""
    bin_str = '{:b}'.format(N)
    sum_str = ''.join(bin_str.split('1'))
    return sum_str
```
This script defines a function `solve(N)` that takes an integer `N` as input and returns the binary representation of the sum of its digits.

Here's how it works:
1. The function uses the `format` method with a format specifier `{:b}` to convert the integer `N` to a string representing its binary equivalent. This is done by appending `0b` to the integer and converting it to binary. At the same time, it removes any leading zeros, ensuring that the binary representation is concise.
2. Next, the function uses `split('1')` to split the binary string into individual segments representing the binary digits of `N`.
3. These segments are then joined together into a single string, effectively combining the binary digits into a cumulative binary representation.
4. The resulting cumulative binary string is then returned as the sum of the digits in binary form. 

This solution efficiently computes the sum of digits in binary representation for the given integer `N`. And it does so without explicitly converting the integer to a binary representation, thus optimizing the process.
