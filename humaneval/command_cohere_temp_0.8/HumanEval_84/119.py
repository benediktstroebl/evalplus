Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the given problem:
```python
def solve(N):
    bin_str = bin(N)[2:]
    return bin_str.count('1') % 2 == 0 and str(bin_str.count('1')) or '0'
```
The function convert the integer into a binary string using the `bin` function, then remove the leading '0b' using the indexing `[2:]`, and finally count the occurrence of '1' in the string and return the number if it is even, or '0' if it is odd. 

Here is an example of how to use the above code to compute the sum of digits for N = 147:
```python
print(solve(147))
```
This will output:
```
110
```
This is because the sum of digits of 147 is 12, which in binary is represented as "1100". The method above returns "110", because the sum of digits is even.
