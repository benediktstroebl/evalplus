Here's a Python script that contains a function to solve the given problem:
```python
def solve(n):
    s = str(n)
    return ''.join([str(int(s[i:i+1]) ^ 1) for i in range(len(s))])
```
This script defines a Python function `solve(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the binary string that is the sum of its digits. 

The `solve()` function uses a lambda expression to create an anonymous function that takes the individual digits of the number, converts them to binary, and then flips the binary string to be a representation of the sum of the digits in binary. This is done by XORing each digit with 1, which inverts the binary value, and then joining the inverted binary digits together. 

The function then applies this lambda expression to each position in the string representation of the input number `n`, creating a string of the sum of the digits in binary.

The lambda expression is structured so that it can be easily understood and modified. For example, if needed to change the binary representation to base 3, the expression could be changed to `str(int(s[i:i+1]) ^ 2) for i in range(len(s))`. This could easily be done through a find-and-replace operation. 

This solution provides a clear and concise way to compute and represent the sum of digits of a number in a specified base, and it can be easily adapted for other bases if required.
