Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the given problem:
```python
def solve(N):
    """
    :type N: int
    :param N: integer
    :rtype: str
    """
    bin_str = bin(N)[2:]
    sum_list = []
    for digit in bin_str:
        sum_list.append(int(digit))
    total_sum = sum(sum_list)
    return format(total_sum, 'b')
```

The function `solve` takes an integer `N` as its argument and returns a string representing the binary number that is the sum of its digits. The function first converts the integer `N` to a binary string, ensuring that it does not contain leading zeros, and then iterates through each digit in the binary string. It converts each digit to an integer and sums them, eventually returning the binary string format of the total sum. 
This solution passes all the test cases mentioned earlier.
