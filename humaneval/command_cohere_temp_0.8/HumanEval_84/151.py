Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the problem:
```python
def solve(N):
    BIN_DIGITS = '01'
    res = bin(sum(int(d) for d in str(N)))[2:]
    return res if res.isdigit() else '0' + res
```
The function utilize the fact that summing the digits of a number results in a smaller sum than the original number. The digits in binary representation are treated the same way, the sum of the digit sums will be smaller than the sum of the original number and repeating this process until we get a single digit or a string with leading zeros. The tests are provided to ensure the correctness of the solution in different scenarios. 
The test cases can be used to validate the functionality of the script. 

The implementation above will iterate and add up the digits in the binary representation each iteration will cut down the number by 2^(number of digits in the biggest before digit). e.g. 150 will be "10" in binary, cutting it to 1, and 6 will be "110", cutting it to 2.
