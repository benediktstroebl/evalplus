Here's a Python script that contains a function called `eat` that solves the given problem:
```python
def eat(n, need, rem):
    ct, leftover = 0, 0
    while need > 0:
        if rem == 0:
            break
        ct += 1
        leftover = max(0, rem)
        rem -= 1
        need -= 1
    return [ct, leftover]
```

This function represents the hungry rabbit scenario, where the rabbit starts with an initial consumption of `n` carrots and eventually eats `need` carrots to reach its daily target. Throughout this process, the rabbit ensures it doesn't overeat and maintains a record of the remaining carrots left in stock after its meals. The function gradually eats the necessary carrots from the available stock, considering the remaining carrots at each step, and finally provides a balanced diet plan, returning the total carrots consumed and the leftover carrots.

The code maintains a couple of variables to keep track of the state. These variables are used to simulate the number of carrots the rabbit has already eaten `ct` (`ct` for 'current total') and the number of carrots left in the stock after the meals `leftover` (`leftover` for 'remaining').

The function body executes a while loop as long as there is a need for more carrots to reach the daily target. Within each iteration, the loop checks the remaining stock and eats as many carrots as possible without exceeding the remaining quantity. It ensures the rabbit doesn't overeat and wastes no food. The loop increments the total consumption (`ct`) by one with each bite, determines the maximum number of carrots left after this bite, and then adjusts both `leftover` and the remaining need accordingly.

If the remaining stock is zero, the loop exits, assuming the rabbit has reached the daily target with the available food. Finally, the function returns a list containing the total number of carrots eaten (`ct`) and the number of leftover carrots (`leftover`), providing a concise report on the rabbit's dietary success.
