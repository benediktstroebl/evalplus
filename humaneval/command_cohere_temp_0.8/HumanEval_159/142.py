Here's a Python script that contains a function eat() that solves the problem described in the markdown code block:
```python
def eat(n, need, rem):
    return [n + need, max(0, rem - need)]
```
This function uses list comprehension to return a list with two elements: the number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots remaining. The function assumes that the rabbit will eat as many carrots as necessary to meet its needs, even if that means eating all the remaining carrots. Note that this solution assumes that the constraints stated in the prompt are in place, even though they are not explicitly checked for in the code.
