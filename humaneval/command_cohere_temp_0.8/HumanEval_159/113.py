Here's a Python script that contains a function eat() that solves the problem described in the code block:
```python
def eat(n, need, rem):
    cnt = max(0, min(need, rem))
    n += cnt
    rem -= cnt
    return [n, rem]
```
This function determines the number of carrots the rabbit consumes, which is between the minimum of need and rem (in case there's not enough to fulfill need) and the maximum of 0 and rem (in case there are no remaining carrots). Subsequently, it returns a list containing the updated values of the number of eaten carrots and the number of remaining carrots.
