Here's a Python script that contains a function called `eat` that solves the given problem:
```python
def eat(n, need, rem):
    if need > rem:
        eat_all = rem
        hunger = need - rem
    else:
        eat_all = need
        hunger = 0
    return [n + eat_all, hunger]
```
This code defines a Python function called 'eat' with three parameters: 'n', 'need', and 'rem'. This function is designed to simulate a rabbit's eating behavior based on the given parameters. 

The function aims to return a pair of values in a list: the first value represents the total number of carrots eaten after the current meal, and the second value represents the number of carrots remaining after the meal. 

The code includes a logical condition to determine the number of carrots consumed and the rabbit's hunger level. If the 'need' for carrots is greater than the remaining carrots ('rem'), it means the rabbit consumes all the remaining carrots and still feels hungry because the 'need' is not fully satisfied. In this case, the variables 'eat_all' and 'hunger' are assigned appropriate values. 

If the 'need' is less than or equal to the 'rem', it means the rabbit consumes only the required amount and will not be hungry afterwards. In this case, the 'eat_all' variable is set to the 'need', and the 'hunger' variable is set to 0.

Finally, the function returns a list containing these two values [n + eat_all, hunger].

This function ensures that the rabbit's eating behavior is logically simulated based on the given parameters and follows the constraints mentioned in the prompt.
