Here's a Python script that contains a function eat() that solves the problem described in the code block:
```python
def eat(n, need, rem):
    return [n + min(need, rem), max(0, rem - need)]
```
This function takes three parameters, n (number of carrots already eaten), need (number of carrots needed to be eaten), and rem (the number of remaining carrots). The function returns a list containing two numbers: the total number of carrots eaten after eating the desired amount and the number of carrots left after the rabbit's meals. Note that the function returns [n + min(need, rem), max(0, rem - need)], which follows the specification of the problem. Also, the constraints of the input are respected.
