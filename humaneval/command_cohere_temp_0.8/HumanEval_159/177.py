Here's a Python script that contains a function named `eat` which solves the given problem:
```python
def eat(n, need, rem):
    ate, leftover = n, rem
    if ate < need:
        ate += leftover
        leftover = 0
    return [ate, leftover]
```

This function takes in the three variables mentioned in the problem prompt: `n` (number of carrots already eaten), `need` (number of carrots needed to be eaten), and `rem` (number of remaining carrots). The function calculates the total number of carrots eaten by adding the already eaten carrots (`n`) to the remaining carrots (`rem`). It assumes the rabbit eats as much as possible to reach the desired goal of `need`. Then, the function returns a list containing [total carrots eaten, leftover carrots after meal].

The script above should solve the problem and produce the correct output for the given inputs mentioned in the prompt. Let me know if you need anything else!
