Here's a Python script that contains a function eat() that solves the problem described in the code block:
```python
def eat(n, need, rem):
    ate = n + min(need, rem)
    rem = max(0, rem - need)
    return [ate, rem]
```
This function uses three parameters: 'n' represents the number of carrots already eaten, 'need' represents the number of carrots needed to be eaten, and 'rem' represents the remaining number of carrots. 

The function eats the minimum of what is needed and what remains. Then, it sets the remaining to the maximum of 0 and what remains minus what was just eaten. The function returns a list containing the total number of carrots eaten (ate) and the number of carrots left (rem). 

Here's an example usage of the function:
```python
print(eat(5, 6, 10))  # Output: [11, 4]
print(eat(4, 8, 9))  # Output: [12, 1]
print(eat(1, 10, 10))  # Output: [11, 0]
print(eat(2, 11, 5))  # Output: [7, 0]
```
This example usage demonstrates various scenarios and shows how the function responds with the total number of eaten carrots and the number of carrots left after each meal. 
If the rabbit's "need" is greater than the "remaining", then the "need" will be set to the "remaining" and the rabbit will still be hungry afterwards. 

This script will provide the correct output for any valid input that abides by the constraints you provided. Let me know if you would like to know more! 
I can also write a test suite to ensure that the function behaves correctly for all edge cases. Do you want me to add tests to this code to verify the robustness of this function?
