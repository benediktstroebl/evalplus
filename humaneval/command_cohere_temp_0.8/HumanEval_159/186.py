Here's a Python script that contains a function eat() that solves the given problem:
```python
def eat(n, need, rem):
    ct = n + need
    rt = max(0, rem - (need))
    return [ct, rt]
```
This function takes in the number of carrots already eaten (`n`), the number of carrots needed to be eaten (`need`), and the total remaining carrots (`rem`). It calculates the total number of carrots eaten (`ct`) after meeting the 'need' requirements and the remaining number of carrots (`rt`). The 'rt' value is max(0, rem - (need)) which ensures that if the rabbit can't eat 'need' carrots because there aren't enough remaining, it will still return a value of 0 for 'rt' but will have eaten the maximum possible amount.

This should address the problem you had and match the examples you provided. Let me know if you need anything else!
