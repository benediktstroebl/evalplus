Here's a Python script that contains a function eat() that solves the problem described in the code block above:
```python
def eat(n, need, remaining):
    """
    You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots,
    but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.
    you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,
                                    the number of carrots left after your meals ]
    if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.
    """
    eaten = n + need
    if eaten > remaining:
        eaten = remaining
    else:
        eaten = eaten
    return [eaten, remaining - eaten]
```

This script includes a function 'eat' which takes in the three variables mentioned in the prompt, and returns a list with two elements - the first element being the total number of carrots eaten after meals, and the second element being the number of carrots left after eating. If there are not enough carrots remaining in the stock, the function eats all the remaining carrots, but still returns the number of remaining carrots as 0, as mentioned in the prompt. 

The function is designed to adhere to the constraints provided in the prompt, returning errors or undefined behavior for inputs that do not meet the given constraints. 

This solution should help you solve the hungry rabbit problem and ensure you don't go hungry even if there's a shortage of carrots!
