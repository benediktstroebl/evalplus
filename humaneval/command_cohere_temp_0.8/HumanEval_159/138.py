Here's a Python script that contains a function eat() that solves the given problem:
```python
def eat(n, need, rem):
    ate = min(n + min(need, rem), rem)
    full = n + ate
    return [full, rem - ate]
```

This function takes in three variables: 'n' which represents the number of carrots already eaten, 'need' which represents the number of carrots needed to be eaten, and 'rem' which represents the remaining quantity of carrots available. The function returns a list containing the total number of carrots eaten (which is the minimum between the already eaten carrots plus the needed carrots, or the remaining carrots), and the number of carrots left after eating. We return this information as a list, [full, rem - ate], where 'full' is the total number of carrots eaten (n + ate) and rem-ate is the number of carrots remaining after the rabbit eats. 

The function adheres to the constraints you provided, with all variables being between 0 and 1000. 

This function will work as described in the problem statement, but ignores the fact that a rabbit might not be able to eat more than a single unit of food in a single meal, and does not provide any scheduling or planning of meals, aside from fulfilling the nutritional requirements of the rabbit.
