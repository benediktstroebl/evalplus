Here's a Python script that contains a function called `eat` that solves the given problem:
```python
def eat(n, need, rem):
    if n + need > rem:
        eat_all = rem
        hungry = True
    else:
        eat_all = n + need
        hungry = False
    return [eat_all, rem - eat_all] if not hungry else [eat_all, 0]
```

This script defines a function called `eat` that takes three parameters: `n` which represents the number of carrots already eaten, `need` which represents the additional number of carrots needed to be eaten, and `rem` which represents the remaining quantity of carrots available. 

The function will consume all the remaining carrots if the total number of carrots to be eaten exceeds the remaining quantity. Otherwise, it will consume the needed number of carrots and return the total eaten count and the remaining count.

The last line is a validation statement that returns the result of the `eat` function if the result is not hungry, meaning it had enough carrots. Otherwise, it returns the maximum possible count for eaten carrots and zero for the remaining as it does not have enough carrots to fulfill its needs. 

You can add test cases as follows to verify the functionality of the solution:
```python
test_cases = [
    (5, 6, 10,),
    (4, 8, 9),
    (1, 10, 10),
    (2, 11, 5),
]

for n, need, rem in test_cases:
    result = eat(n, need, rem)
    expected = [11, 4] if n + need <= rem else [12, 1]
    assert result == expected, f"For inputs {n}, {need}, {rem}, the expected result is {expected}, but the function result is {result}"
```

Here, each test case is a triplet of integers representing the three input parameters' values, and the expected output is a tuple that follows the ` **[total eaten, remaining]** ` format.
