Here's a Python script that contains a function called `eat` that solves the given problem:
```python
def eat(n, need, rem):
    return [n + need, rem - need]
```
This function uses the variables provided to calculate the number of carrots consumed and the number of carrots remaining after the rabbit eats to fulfill its nutritional needs. The result is then returned as a list in the following format: `[total number of eaten carrots after your meals, the number of carrots left after your meals]`. 
For example, if the number of carrots already eaten is 5, the number of carrots needed to eat is 6, and the remaining number of carrots available is 10, the function would return `[11, 4]`.

This solution adheres to the specified constraints.
