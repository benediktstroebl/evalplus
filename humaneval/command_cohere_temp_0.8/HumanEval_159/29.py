Here's a Python script that contains a function eat() that solves the problem described in the markdown code block:
```python
def eat(n, need, rem):
    """
    You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots,
    but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.
    you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,
                                    the number of carrots left after your meals ]
    if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.
    """
    eat_amount = max(0, min(need, rem))
    n += eat_amount
    rem -= eat_amount
    return [n, rem]
```
This function takes in 3 parameters: 'n' which represents the number of carrots already eaten, 'need' which represents the number of carrots needed to be eaten, and 'rem' which represents the remaining amount of carrots. The function returns a list containing two items [total number of carrots after eating, number of carrots left after eating]. If there are not enough carrots to fulfill the 'need', the rabbit will eat all of the remaining carrots but will still be hungry as indicated by the second returned value.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(eat(5, 6, 10))  # Output: [11, 4]
print(eat(4, 8, 9))  # Output: [12, 1]
print(eat(1, 10, 10))  # Output: [11, 0]
print(eat(2, 11, 5))  # Output: [7, 0]
```

This script will pass all the examples provided in the markdown code block.
