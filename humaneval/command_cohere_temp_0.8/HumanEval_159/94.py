Here's a Python script that contains a function eat() that solves the problem as described in the provided code block:
```python
def eat(n, need, remaining):
    # Calculate the number of carrots left after eating the needed amount
    remaining_after_meal = max(0, remaining - need)
    
    # Calculate the total number of carrots eaten overall
    total_eaten = n + need
    
    # Return the results as a list
    return [total_eaten, remaining_after_meal]

# Testing the function
def test_eat():
    assert eat(5, 6, 10) == [11, 4]
    assert eat(4, 8, 9) == [12, 1]
    assert eat(1, 10, 10) == [11, 0]
    assert eat(2, 11, 5) == [7, 0]

# Run tests if executed directly
if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_eat()
```
This script defines a function eat() that takes three parameters, n (number of carrots already eaten), need (number of carrots needed to be eaten), and remaining (the total number of remaining carrots). The function returns a list [total eaten carrots, carrots left after eating the needed amount].

The code also includes a test module that verifies the correctness of the eat() function against the examples provided in the prompt. When executed directly, these tests will be run automatically. 

The approach undertaken solves the problem using basic arithmetic and constraints handling to provide a valid program flow.
