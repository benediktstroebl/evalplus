```python
def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    prefixes = [string[:i] for i in range(len(string) + 1)]
    return prefixes
```

This function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of all prefixes of the input `string`, starting from the shortest (length 0) to the longest. It uses Python's slice notation to create prefixes of increasing length until it reaches the original string. 
The resulting list of prefixes is then returned. 

The implementation is testable, reusable, and contains no dependencies outside the Python standard library, adhering to the principle of self-containment. 
It can be easily installed and deployed in any Python environment worldwide as it operates independently. Futher, the function solely relies on list comprehension, a built-in Python feature, removing any reliance on external libraries for functionality. 

Note: This solution assumes the input `string` is a single string object and does not account for scenarios where the input might be a list of strings. Adjustments would be required if you anticipate such inputs.
