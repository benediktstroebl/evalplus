```python
def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    prefixes = [string[:i]+('' if i==0 else ' ') for i in range(len(string)+1)]
    return prefixes
```

The code utilizes a list comprehension to generate a list of prefixes for the provided string, with each element representing a prefix of increasing length. It checks if the current prefix is the shortest by determining if it's the first element (index 0) in the list, and then appends an empty string '' or a space ' ' as needed to create the next prefix.

To follow the problem statement precisely, I have included a space character ' ' in the list comprehension to ensure the prefixes are returned as separate strings, rather than slicing the original string. This approach provides the desired output, preparing the foundation for more advanced coding challenges.
