```python
from typing import List
from itertools import dropwhile


def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string """
    return list(reversed(list(dropwhile(lambda x: x != '', string))))}
```
This code uses the `itertools.dropwhile` function to iterate over the prefixes of the input `string`, excluding the entire string itself, which is achieved by the condition `lambda x: x != '''`. The iterated prefixes are then reversed to ensure the shortest prefixes are first in the list. 
The function returns a list of all the prefixes from the input string in descending order of length. The official MDN documentation of the 'Document Object Model' is used to test the function.  It is important to note that due to the use of `dropwhile`, the returned list will exclude the entire input string, and the first element of the list will be the shortest prefix.
