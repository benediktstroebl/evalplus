```python
import re
from typing import List

def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string """
    # Pattern to extract prefixes of any length
    pattern = '^(?:' + re.escape(string).replace('\\\^', '[^']) + ')?';
    return [w[0] for w in re.findall(pattern, string)]
```

This code leverages regular expressions (re) to solve the problem. The pattern `^(?:<prefix>)?` is used, where `<prefix>` corresponds to the input string escaped and optionally anchored, to find all prefixes of the input string. By using `re.escape(string).replace('\\\^', '[^'])`, any possible meta characters in the input string are escaped, ensuring proper matching. The regex is then repeated for each substring of the input to find all possible prefixes. The code is encapsulated within a function, `all_prefixes`, that takes a string as input and returns a list of strings, representing all the prefixes from the shortest to the longest. 

The function is self-contained, requiring no external variables or dependencies, ensuring it can be easily reused in other projects or scripts.
