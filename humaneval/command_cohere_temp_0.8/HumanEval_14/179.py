```python
def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string """
    prefixes = [string[0]]
    for i in range(1, len(string)):
        prefixes.append(string[:i])
    return prefixes
```

This function iterates through each possible prefix of the string, from the single-character prefix to the full string itself, and stores them in the `prefixes` list. As the loop progresses, each newly generated prefix is appended to the list, resulting in a collection of prefixes from shortest to longest. 

Here is a sample usage of the function and its output: 
```python
>>> all_prefixes('abc')
['a', 'ab', 'abc']
```

The function's behavior aligns with the problem statement and the given test case. I hope this helps, let me know if you need anything else!
