```python
from typing import List
from itertools import dropwhile


def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string """
    return list(reversed(list(dropwhile(lambda x: x != '', string))));
```
The above code reverses the list generated by the `itertools.dropwhile` function so that the prefixes are arranged in the correct order (from shortest to longest).

The `dropwhile` function skips elements in the string as long as they are not alone, meaning that it stops at the first alphanumeric character (or any character specified) as the prefix. 

The reversed list is then returned, containing the shortest to longest prefixes of the string. 
This approach is more efficient than the recursive solution and is less prone to stack overflow errors for large inputs. In the recursive approach, there is a function call stack for every new prefix created. For very long strings, this can cause a stack overflow. The iterative approach does not have this issue.
