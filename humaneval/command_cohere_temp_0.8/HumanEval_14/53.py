```python
from typing import List
def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    prefixes = [string[:i]+('' if i == 0 else ' ') * (len(string) - i) for i in range(len(string) + 1)]
    return prefixes
```

This script defines a function `all_prefixes` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a list of all prefixes of `s`, from the shortest to the longest. The function uses a list comprehension to generate the prefixes. For each length of prefix ranging from 1 to the length of the input string, the function constructs a prefix of this length by extracting characters from the beginning of the string and then filling up with spaces to the desired length. The resulting list of prefixes is returned.  This approach ensures that the problem is solved in a self-contained manner, as requested, by providing an implementation that includes all necessary code to run and test the functionality within the code block.
