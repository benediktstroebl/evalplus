```python
def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    prefixes = [string[:i] for i in range(len(string) + 1)]
    return prefixes
```

This function defines a list of prefixes, ranging from the shortest to the longest, which is then returned. The approach is to use list comprehension to generate all prefixes of the input string by iterating over all possible lengths of the prefix, from 0 to the length of the input string.

The type hint `List[str]` states that the function returns a list of strings, and the `-> List[str]` annotation syntax is used for the same purpose.

This problem can be solved using Python's string slicing and list comprehension in a concise and clear manner.
