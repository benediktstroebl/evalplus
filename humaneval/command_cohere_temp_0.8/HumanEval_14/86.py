```python
import re
from typing import List

def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string """
    prefixes = []
    current_prefix = ''
    for char in string:
        current_prefix += char
        prefixes.append(current_prefix)
    return prefixes
```

The code uses a simple `for` loop to iterate through each character in the string and adds it to the `current_prefix`. It stores each current prefix found in the `prefixes` list. Starting with an empty prefix, the code will incrementally build up to the longest prefix by appending each character from the input string. It ensures that all the prefixes are stored in the correct order, from shortest to longest. 

The `re` module isn't used in this code, whereas, in the previous version, it was mistakenly used to replace a string, which isn't necessary for this problem's solution.
