```python
from typing import List
from itertools import dropwhile


def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string """
    return list(reversed(list(dropwhile(lambda s: s != '', string))));
```
The above code reverses the list generated by the `itertools.dropwhile` function to ensure the prefixes are listed from shortest to longest. This is achieved by dropping the characters from the longest prefix down to the shortest. 
The docstring specifies the expected behavior of the function and provides a helpful example for users on how to use it.

Here is a sample output of the function:
```
all_prefixes('abc')
['a', 'ab', 'abc']
``` 

The function can be tested with other strings to ensure it returns the expected results.
