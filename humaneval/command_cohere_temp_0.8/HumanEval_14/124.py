```python
def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    prefixes = [string[:i] for i in range(len(string) + 1)]
    return prefixes
```

This function defines a list of all prefixes of the input string, ranging from the shortest (the empty string) to the longest (the entire string). It uses a list comprehension to generate all possible prefixes of the input string by taking substrings of different lengths. The resulting list of prefixes is then returned.  The idea is to use a list comprehension to generate all possible prefixes of the input string by taking substrings of different lengths. This is achieved by iterating through valid starting indices (ranging from 0 to length of the input string) and using the slice notation to extract prefixes of different lengths.
