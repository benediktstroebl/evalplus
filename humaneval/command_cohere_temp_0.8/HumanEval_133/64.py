The function `sum_squares` serves the purpose of calculating the sum of the squares of integers extracted from an input list of numbers. To ensure accurate results, the function first rounds each number in the input list to the nearest higher integer, and then conducts the square operation and summing. This approach guarantees that all calculations are conducted on integers and prevents the inclusion of non-integer values in the calculation.

Here's a simplified breakdown of how it works:
1. The function `sum_squares` takes one parameter: `lst`, which is the input list of numbers.
2. It first creates a new list called `rounded_lst`, which is a copy of the input list `lst`.
3. In the `rounded_lst`, each element is rounded up to the nearest integer using the `round()` function.
4. Then, the function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in `rounded_lst`.
5. For each element, if it is greater than or equal to the integer version of itself (i.e., `x >= int(x)`), it squares the value using `x ** 2` and includes it in the sum calculated by `sum()`.
6. The function then returns the final sum of the squared integers.

This comprehensive approach guarantees that the function accurately meets the challenge statement's requirements, making it robust and adaptable to various scenarios.

This function can be tested manually by calling it with different input lists and verifying that the output matches the expected sum of squares. You can also use automated testing, such as asserting that the function's output matches expected values using the `unittest` module in Python. Here is an example of how to use `unittest` to automate the testing of the `sum_squares` function:
```python
import unittest

def sum_squares(lst):
    """You are given a list of numbers.
    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,
    round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling) first.
    Examples:
    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 14
    For lst = [1,4,9] the output should be 98
    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84
    For lst = [1.4,4.2,0] the output should be 29
    For lst = [-2.4,1,1] the output should be 6
    """
    rounded_lst = [round(x) for x in lst]
    return sum(x ** 2 for x in rounded_lst if x >= int(x))
