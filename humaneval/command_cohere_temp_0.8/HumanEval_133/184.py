The function `sum_squares` takes a list as its argument and returns the sum of the squares of the integers in that list. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list, square it, and filter out non-integer values, which are set to 0. The resulting sum is then returned as the function output.

The script includes test cases as assertions to verify the functionality of the `sum_squares` function, ensuring that it passes a variety of inputs, including edge cases, and returns the expected outputs.

Overall, the code provides an efficient solution to the problem statement and demonstrates proper Python practices, including type hinting and expressive docstrings.
