    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84

This script defines a function `sum_squares` that takes in a list of numbers and squares each rounded element in the list using Python's built-in `sum` function and a list comprehension. This squared list is then summed up to provide the final result. The rounding of each element in the list happens via the built-in `round` function. The rounded list is then returned.
