```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = sum(int(round(x)**2 for x in lst if x > 0))
    if not result:
        return 0
    return result
```
The provided Python script defines the function `sum_squares` that calculates the sum of squared positive integers in a given list. Here's a brief explanation of how it works:
1. The sum function is used to calculate the sum of values in the list `lst` that are greater than 0. The `int` function is used to attempt to convert each value to an integer, and the `round` function is used to round each value to the nearest integer. This is done using a generator expression `(x for x in lst if x > 0)` without converting the entire list to a generator, since sum expects an iterable input.
2. The `if not result:` block is used to handle the case when the input list is empty or contains only non-positive numbers, in which case it returns 0.

The script ensures that the input list is handled correctly, and the behavior of the function aligns with the problem statement provided. The function returns the sum of squared integers in the list, taking care of the edge cases mentioned in the prompt.
