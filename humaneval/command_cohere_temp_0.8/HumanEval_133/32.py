    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84

The function `sum_squares()` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of the squares of those numbers, rounded to the nearest integer. To achieve this, it first uses a list comprehension to round each number in the input list to the nearest integer. Then, it uses another list comprehension to square each rounded number, and finally sums all the squared numbers using the `sum()` function. This problem can be solved in one line using `sum()` and list comprehension. 

This solution passes all the test cases mentioned in the problem statement.
