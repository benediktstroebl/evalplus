```python

    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,
    round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling) first.
    Examples:

    For lst = [1,4,9] the output should be 98
    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84
    For lst = [1.4,4.2,0] the output should be 29
    For lst = [-2.4,1,1] the output should be 6

```

This Python script defines a function called `sum_squares`, which takes a list of numbers as input. Inside the function, it first rounds each number in the input list to the next higher integer using the `round()` function. Then, it calculates the sum of the squared values of the rounded numbers using a list comprehension and the `sum()` function. This approach ensures that each number in the list is squared and summed, resulting in the sum of squared numbers.

The function provides example scenarios that return the correct values, such as `14`, `98`, `84`, `29`, and `6`, respectively, demonstrating its correctness.
