```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    """You are given a list of numbers.
    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,
    round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling) first.
    Examples:
    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 14
    For lst = [1,4,9] the output should be 98
    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84
    For lst = [1.4,4.2,0] the output should be 29
    For lst = [-2.4,1,1] the output should be 6
    """
    result = sum(x ** 2 for x in map(lambda x: round(x), lst))
    return result
```

The code employs a compressed syntax for a list comprehension for mapping round(x) over the input list lst, calculating the square of each element, and summing the results using the sum function. 

To ensure functionality, test cases may be necessary. Below is a basic set of test cases to verify the function:
```python
# Test case for the sum_squares function
def test_sum_squares():
    assert sum_squares([1, 2, 3]) == 14
    assert sum_squares([1, 4, 9]) == 98
    assert sum_squares([1, 3, 5, 7]) == 84
    assert sum_squares([1.4, 4.2, 0]) == 29
    assert sum_squares([-2.4, 1, 1]) == 6

test_sum_squares()
```

To test various scenarios of input, you can add more test cases, and ensure the function behaves as expected.
