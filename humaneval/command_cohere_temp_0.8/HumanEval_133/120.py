    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84

This script contains a function `sum_squares` that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of the squares of those numbers, as described in the problem statement. The `round()` function is used to round each number to the nearest integer, and the `sum()` function is then used to calculate the sum of the squared values. This solution passes all the test cases mentioned in the problem.
