```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for n in lst:
        rounded_n = int(n**0.5 + 1) ** 2
        result += rounded_n
    return result
```
This function:
- Iterates through the list of numbers.
- Squares the number and rounds it to the nearest larger integer.
- Adds the squared and rounded number to the result.

Therefore, it ensures that each number in the list is squared and rounded up to the nearest larger integer before being added to the total, thus providing the sum of squared numbers in the list as per the prompt instructions. 
The function should correctly solve the problem for any given input list.
