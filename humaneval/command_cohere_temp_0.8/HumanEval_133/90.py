```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for n in lst:
        result += n**2
    return result
```
This Python script defines a function called sum_squares, which takes a list called lst as input. This function calculates the sum of squared numbers in the list and returns the result.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:
1. The function sum_squares is defined with one parameter, lst, representing the input list of numbers.
2. It initializes a variable result to 0, which will store the sum of squared numbers in the list.
3. Then, it iterates through each number n in the input list using a for loop.
4. Within the loop, it adds the square of each number (n**2) to the result variable.
5.  After iterating through all numbers in the list, the function returns the calculated sum of squared numbers.

This code essentially squares each number in the input list and adds them together to obtain the desired sum of squared numbers.

The code is concise and straightforward, expressing the intent of calculating the sum of squares clearly and efficiently. It avoids unnecessary complexity and is optimized for performance due to the absence of unnecessary computations or repetitive operations.
