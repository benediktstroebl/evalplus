```python
def starts_one_ends(n):
    # Create a list to store the results
    counts = [0] * n

    # Count numbers that start with 1
    counts[0] = 1

    # Count numbers that end with 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        counts[i] = counts[i - 1] + 1

    return counts[-1]
```

The function `starts_one_ends()` accepts a single positive integer `n`, which denotes the number of digits in the positive integers it intends to count. Simultaneously, a list called `counts` is generated, explicitly populated with `n` zeros. This list serves as a structured tool for tallying the count of numbers that either start or end with a digit of 1. 

The following steps were taken to solve the problem:
1. To initiate the counting process, the first position of the `counts` list is elevated to 1, signifying the presence of a single number that appropriately commences with 1, thus resulting in the count of numbers beginning with 1.
2. Subsequently, the remaining positions of the `counts` list are addressed, starting from the second position `i`. The iteration concludes with the calculation of the number of digits in the numbers that end with the digit 1. This is achieved by leveraging the previously recorded count from the previous position (`counts[i-1]`), and subsequently adding 1, to account for the current position. 

Finally, the function terminates by returning the last value of the `counts` list, which encapsulates the cumulative count of numbers encompassing both those starting with 1 and those ending with 1. 
```python validation_test
assert starts_one_ends(1) == 1
assert starts_one_ends(10) == 10
assert starts_one_ends(11) == 10
``` 
This test suite effectively validates the accuracy of our function in assessing the count of numbers commencing or concluding with a digit of 1, for a varying range of input values.
