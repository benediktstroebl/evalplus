Here's a Python script with a self-contained function `starts_one_ends` that solves the problem as described in the markdown code block:
```python
def starts_one_ends(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit
    positive integers that start or end with 1.
    """
    # Create a list to store the digits from 0 to 9.
    digits = list(range(10))
    # Remove the digits 0 and 1 to avoid duplicates when starting or ending with 1.
    digits.remove(0)
    digits.remove(1)
    
    # Consider all n-digit numbers from 2 to 9999...99 (maximum n = 4)
    max_n_digit = max(str(len(str(i))) for i in range(1000, 10000, 2))
    n_digit = int(max_n_digit)
    
    count = 0
    for i in range(2, 10**n_digit):
        current_num = str(i)
        if current_num[0] == '1' or current_num[-1] == '1':
            count += 1
        if len(current_num) == n_digit:
            break
    
    return count
```
This script defines the function `starts_one_ends` which takes in a positive integer `n` as input and returns the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. It then returns the count of such numbers. This solution does not require any imports and is self-contained within the function. 

Let's break down the solution step by step:
1. The script begins with a comment that summarizes the problem. This provides a clear understanding of the task at hand.
2. The `digits` list is created to store the digits from 0 to 9. This setup is needed for generating all possible numbers within a given length.
3. The digits 0 and 1 are removed from the `digits` list. This is a crucial step to avoid duplicate counting. Numbers starting or ending with 1 that have single digits will be considered separately.
4. The script determines the maximum number of digits `n_digit` to consider. This limit ensures that the loop iterates over all possible numbers within a reasonable range to avoid excessive computation.
5. The variable `count` is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the numbers starting or ending with 1.
6. A loop runs from 2 to 10^n_digit. It iterates through all the possible numbers within the range of length `n_digit`.
7. For each number in the loop, its string representation `current_num` is checked.
8. If `current_num` starts with '1' or ends with '1', it satisfies the condition, and the `count` is incremented.
9. The loop concludes after considering all numbers with the given digit length.
10. Finally, the function returns the computed count of numbers that start or end with 1.

This solution is efficient and can handle the calculations within a reasonable time frame for small input values of `n`.
