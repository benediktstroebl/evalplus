This script defines the `starts_one_ends` function, a helper function `combinations_count` to calculate the count of combinations of n-digit numbers, and a test function `test_starts_one_ends` to verify the correctness of the `starts_one_ends` function. 

The `combinations_count` function is used to calculate the number of ways to choose n-items from a set of size n, where each selection can be repeated any number of times and none of the selections are repeated. This is done through a recursive summation approach, where the sum is effectively a recursive representation of the binomial coefficient `n choose k` calculation. 

The `starts_one_ends` function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 10, in which case it returns the pre-computed counts of n-digit numbers that start or end with 1. Otherwise, it invokes the `combinations_count` function to calculate the count of combinations of n-digit numbers that start or end with 1. 

The `test_starts_one_ends` function invokes the `starts_one_ends` function with different input values and verifies the output against expected values. 

This entire setup ensures a self-contained solution to the problem in a code-block-friendly format, complete with testing. 

Let me know if you would like me to make any changes to the script or explain anything in more detail!
