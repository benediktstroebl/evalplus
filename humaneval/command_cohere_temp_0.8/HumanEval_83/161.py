```python
def starts_one_ends(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.
    """
    # Create a string of n digits
    num = "".join(str(x) for x in range(1, n + 1))
    # Create the 2^n possible numbers from this template
    numbers = [num[i:] + str(num[:i]) for i in range(n)] + [num + '1']
    # Count the ones that start or end with 1
    return sum(1 for x in numbers if x[0] == '1' or x[-1] == '1')
```

This approach creates all the numbers using a simple template and then iterates through them to determine which ones start or end with 1. Let's validate this solution by testing it against a sample case and asserting the output. 

```python
# Testing the starts_one_ends function
n = 2  # Change this to test for a different input n
expected_count = 4  # Change this to test for a different expected output

# Test 1: n = 2, expected_count = 4
assert starts_one_ends(n) == expected_count
```

This test case will ensure that the function `starts_one_ends` returns the expected count for the specified number of digits `n`.  If this produces the expected outcome, press `up` to retrieve the earlier problem statement to proceed with your work. If you would like to delve further into how to test this function, let me know, and I can provide additional testing advice and techniques.
