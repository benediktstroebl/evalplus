This solution leverages a 2D array structure to efficiently keep track of the count of numbers starting and ending with 1 for `n-digit` positive integers. It initially populates the counts for `1-digit` and `2-digit` numbers, and then iterates through wider digits to compute the counts for larger `n-digit` numbers. The code then provides the count of numbers that start or end with 1 for each digit `n`.
