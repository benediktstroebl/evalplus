```python
def starts_one_ends(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.
    """
    # Create a string of n digits
    num = '1' * n

    # Calculate the two possible cases for starting and ending with 1
    endings_with_1 = len(num) - 2
    starts_with_1 = 1 if n >= 2 else 0

    return endings_with_1 + starts_with_1
```

This approach involves creating a string (`num`) with `n` digits, all of which are 1. We then calculate the numbers of the `num` starting and ending with 1. Specifically, the number of endings with 1 can be computed as `len(num) - 2` (subtracting 2 to account for the central 1's). Since we don't know whether the 1 used in the computation is the first or last digit, we add the case where `n` is 1 or 2, where the starting 1 cannot be omitted, hence the `if` statement. Finally, the total count is returned by adding the counts of the two cases.

The total time complexity of this code is O(N), where N represents the given positive integer n, as it involves creating a string of n digits, which takes O(n) time, and a few subsequent arithmetic operations which are all O(1). The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space to store the `num` string, besides the given `n` parameter.
