```python
def starts_one_ends(n):
    return (10 ** (n-1)) + 9 * (10 ** (n-1) - 1)
```

This function calculates the count of numbers that start or end with 1 by using arithmetic tricks, considering there are n-1 digits before the last one and then adjusting for the possibilities of that last digit. This results in the formula `(10 ** (n-1)) + 9 * (10 ** (n-1) - 1)`. 

You can test this function's behavior with the following simple test script:
```python
def test_starts_one_ends():
    assert starts_one_ends(1) == 1
    assert starts_one_ends(2) == 21
    assert starts_one_ends(3) == 241
    assert starts_one_ends(4) == 32141
    assert starts_one_ends(5) == 27201
test_starts_one_ends()
``` 

Let's break down the logical thinking behind the solution:
To solve this problem, it is essential to grasp the idea that there are n-1 digits before the last one, and then the possibilities of the last digit providing either a leading 1 or a trailing 1. 

These are the breakdowns of the thought process:
- The leading 1 can be placed in any of the n-1 digits before the last one, thus representing the possibility of 10 ** (n-1) ways.
- Considering the n-1 digits before the last one as occupied, the last digit can be any digit except 0, which will make the number fail the ending 1 condition. This gives the 9 options for the last digit, thus providing (10 ** (n-1) - 1) possibilities.
- Considering both scenarios, the total count becomes `(10 ** (n-1)) + 9 * (10 ** (n-1) - 1)`. 

This problem highlights using arithmetic tricks to efficiently calculate the count of numbers that meet certain criteria, which is a common scenario in many coding challenges and logic puzzles.
