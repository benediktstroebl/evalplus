```python
def starts_one_ends(n):
    # Create a list to store the results
    counts = [0] * n

    # Count numbers that start with 1
    counts[0] = 1

    # Count numbers that end with 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        counts[i] += counts[i - 1]

    return counts[-1]
```

The function `starts_one_ends()` accepts a single parameter `n`, representing the length of the numbers we want to consider. It utilizes a sliding window approach to efficiently calculate the count of numbers that end with 1, as shown in the following example:
```python
counts = [0] * n
counts[0] = 1     # Numbers starting with 1
counts[1] = 1     # Numbers starting with 11
counts[2] = 2     # Numbers starting with 111
counts[3] = 3     # Numbers starting with 1111
...
```

It also takes care to ensure that the count of numbers that end with 1 is correctly computed, complementing the count of numbers that start with 1.

This approach provides an efficient solution, with a time complexity of `O(n)` since it only requires a single pass through the numbers, regardless of the number of digits.
