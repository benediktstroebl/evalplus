```python
def starts_one_ends(n):
    # Create a list to store the results for  1st position and last position
    counts = [0 for i in range(n+1)]
    
    # Count the numbers that start with 1
    counts[1] = 1
    
    # Count the numbers that end with 1
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        counts[i] += counts[i-1]
    
    return counts[n]
```

This Python script defines a function `starts_one_ends(n)` designed to calculate the count of positive integers that are `n` digits long and either start or end with the digit 1. Here's a brief overview of how it accomplishes this:
1. To solve the problem, the function utilizes a thoughtful approach of utilizing a `counts` list to keep track of the count of numbers that end with 1 for each position from 1 to `n`.
2. It initialize all elements of `counts` to 0 except the first position which is 1 to handle the counting of numbers starting with 1. 
3. Then, utilizing a clever recursive approach through the `counts` list, the function calculates the count of numbers ending with 1 for each position from 2 to `n`.
4. The final count of numbers that are `n` digits long and end with 1 is stored in the `counts` list at the n-th position and returned. 

This approach ensures the solution is both efficient and concise.
