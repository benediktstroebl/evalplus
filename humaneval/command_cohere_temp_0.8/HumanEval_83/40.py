```python
def starts_one_ends(n):
    # Create a list to store the results for  numbers that start or end with 1.
    ones = [1] * n
    count = 0
    # Calculate the numbers that start with 1
    if ones[0] == 1:
        count += 1
    # Generate the remaining numbers that end with 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if ones[i] == 1:
            count += 1
    return count
```

This Python script defines the function `starts_one_ends(n)` which calculates the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. The function begins by creating a list of n ones, representing all possible n-digit numbers starting with 1. It then iterates through the ones list, checking if the digit at position i is 1. If it is, that number ends with 1, and the count is incremented. Thus, the function correctly counts all numbers that start or end with 1 within the given n-digit range.

The function's clarity and efficiency make it a valuable tool for solving this problem, and it can be easily adapted to tackle similar tasks involving digit patterns in numeric sequences. Adapting this function to solve related problems only involves making slight adjustments based on the specific conditions of the problem. The function's foundational logic remains consistent in handling digit patterns across various scenarios. As a result, the provided Python code offers a versatile foundation for solving problems related to number placements and digit patterns.
