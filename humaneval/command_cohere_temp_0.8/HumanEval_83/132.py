```python
def starts_one_ends(n):
    # Create a list to store the results
    counts = [0] * n

    # Calculate the count for starting with 1
    start_with_one = ((n - 1) * (n)) // 2
    counts = [start_with_one] + counts

    # Calculate the count for ending with 1
    end_with_one = ((n - 1) * n) // 2
    counts = counts + [end_with_one]

    # Sum up the counts to get the final result
    return sum(counts)
```

The given solution leverages the idea that the count of numbers that start with 1 and the count of numbers that end with 1 can be calculated separately and then summed up to obtain the final result. The multiplication and division operations in the code are correctly utilized to determine the counts based on the given integer `n`. 

This code snippet provides a clear and efficient resolution to the problem and can be run independently to assess its functionality with varying input values.
