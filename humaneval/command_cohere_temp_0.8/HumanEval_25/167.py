```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It starts by iterating from 2 up to `n-1` to check for divisibility. Whenever a number is encountered that is not divisible by any integer within the range `2` to `i-1`, it is identified as prime. Subsequently, this prime factor is added to the list of factors, and then the code repeatedly divides `n` by this factor until it is completely factored out. Finally, the resulting list of factors is returned. 

Here is an example usage of the code:
```python
>>> factorize(8)
[2, 2, 2]
>>> factorize(25)
[5, 5]
>>> factorize(70)
[2, 5, 7]
```
