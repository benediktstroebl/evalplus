    for divisor in range(2, n):
        if n % divisor == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % divisor == 0:
                n //= divisor
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(divisor)
                factors.extend([divisor] * count)

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of an integer `n`. It initializes an empty list called `factors` to store the prime factors, which will be returned once the process is completed. The algorithm then iterates through numbers from 2 up to `n` as potential divisors, starting with 2 to ensure primality.

For each divisor consideration, the algorithm employs a `while` loop to repeatedly divide `n` by the divisor and update the count of its occurrences in the factorization. The divisibility condition is `n % divisor == 0`. Once the division is complete, the algorithm checks if the count is greater than 0; if so, it adds the divisor to the `factors` list and extends it with repetitions, represented as a list.

If after the division process, `n` is greater than 1, it is appended to the `factors` list, assuming it's a prime factor. Finally, the function returns the `factors` list, containing the prime factors in ascending order, each accompanied by its corresponding occurrence count.
