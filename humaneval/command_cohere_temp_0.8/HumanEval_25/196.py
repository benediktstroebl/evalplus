```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given number `n`. It starts by iterating from 2 up to `n-1` to check each integer as a potential factor. Within an inner loop, it checks if the current potential factor is prime by iterating from 2 up to the potential factor itself. If the potential factor is divisible by any integer within this range, it is not prime, and the `is_prime` flag is set to `False`. Otherwise, if it is not divisible by any integer, it is prime.

For each prime factor encountered, it is added to the `factors` list. Additionally, the code ensures that the provided number is expressed as a product of these factors, updating `n` accordingly. To account for any remaining factor greater than 1, the loop terminates with `factors.append(n)`. Ultimately, the function returns the list of prime factors, sorted in ascending order.
