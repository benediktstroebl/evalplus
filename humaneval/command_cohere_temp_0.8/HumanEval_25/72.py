```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code uses a simple algorithm to find the prime factors of an integer `n`. It iterates over integers from 2 up to `n` and for each integer it checks if it is prime. If the integer is prime, it is added to the list of prime factors and the algorithm then checks if the current number can be divided by that prime factor. If it can, the number is divided by that prime factor until it is no longer divisible. Once this loop is completed for all numbers, any remaining number that is larger than 1 will be appended to the list of prime factors. The function then returns the list of prime factors. 

The algorithm efficiently solves the problem in a single function, without the need for additional modules or external function calls, making it self-contained and easy to use elsewhere.

To test this function, you can call it with different input values and verify that the resulting list of prime factors matches the expected output. Here is an example:
```python
>>> factorize(8)
[2, 2, 2]
>>> factorize(25)
[5, 5]
>>> factorize(70)
[2, 5, 7]
```
