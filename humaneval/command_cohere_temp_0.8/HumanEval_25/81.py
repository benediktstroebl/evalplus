The code provides the `prime_factors` function implementing the factorization process. It iterates through potential prime factors from 2 to the square root of the input number `n`, including special cases of input less than 2 and square numbers. The `unittest` module is used to ensure test cases pass with the expected outcomes. You can incorporate this code into your solution to tackle the problem statement. Line explanations are provided for better understanding:
1. Import the required `List` module from the `typing` module.
2. Define the `prime_factors` function, which accepts an integer `n` as input and returns a list of prime factors in ascending order, along with their corresponding counts.
3. If `n` is less than 2, return an empty list since it has no prime factors.
4. Initialize an empty list named `factors` to store the prime factors.
5. While `n` is even, append a factor of 2 to the `factors` list and divide `n` by 2, continuing the process until `n` becomes odd.
6. Begin a loop ranging from 3 to the square root of `n` (skipping even numbers). Inside the loop, append the current factor to the `factors` list if `n` is divisible by it.
7. If `n` is greater than 2 and cannot be divided completely by the previous factors, append `n` itself to the `factors` list.
8. Return the `factors` list.
9. In the module's main context (executed when the script is run directly), a test suite is created using the `unittest` module to validate the behavior of the `prime_factors` function.
10. Define test cases using the `test_factorize_8`, `test_factorize_25`, and `test_factorize_70 functions`. These functions check if the output of `prime_factors` matches the expected list for each input number (`8`, `25`, `70`).
11. Execute the test suite using `unittest.main()`.

The code ensures the `prime_factors` function produces the expected results for the given input numbers, providing an accurate factorization based on the specified criteria.
