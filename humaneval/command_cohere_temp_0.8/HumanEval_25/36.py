```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It begins by assuming that `n` is not divisible by any number less than or equal to its current value. This assumption is validated by attempting to divide `n` by each integer between 2 and `i`. If `i` is a factor of `n`, the algorithm updates the factorization and resumes the loop with the next value of `i`. If `i` is not a factor of `n`, the algorithm continues to test potential factors by incrementing `i`. This process repeats until `n` is divisible by `i`, at which point the loop is terminated and the algorithm continues to the next value of `i`. Ultimately, when the loop has processed all integers from 2 up to `n`, the algorithm terminates, having produced the prime factorization of `n`. 

Here's an example usage of the code:
```python
factorize(8)  # [2, 2, 2]
factorize(25)  # [5, 5]
factorize(70)  # [2, 5, 7]
``` 

This would output the prime factors of the given integers respectively.
