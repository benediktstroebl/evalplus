```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_factor = n % i == 0
        if is_factor and i != 1:
            factors.append(i)
            while is_factor:
                n //= i
                is_factor = n % i == 0
            if n == 1:
                break
    return factors
```

The code employs an efficient factorization algorithm **beginning with the assumption that the input number is even**. It then tests all odd numbers from 2 up to the input number to identify factors. Once a factor is found, it is used to divide the input number and the factorization process is recursively applied to the new input number until the input number becomes 1, at which point the factorization process stops. The algorithm is optimized because it avoids unnecessary factorization by recognizing that a number can only be a factor if it evenly divides the input number.  This helps reduce the complexity of the algorithm.
