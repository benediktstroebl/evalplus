```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(i)
                factors.append(count)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
        factors.append(1)
    return factors[1:]
```
The factorization algorithm runs through potential factors from 2 up to the input number `n` (`2<= i < n`).  It identifies the count of occurrences of a factor in the input number `n` using the `count = 0` multiplication variable. While the input number is divisible by the current factor, it keeps dividing the number and incrementing the `count` variable.

Finally, the algorithm returns a list of prime factors, where each factor is accompanied by its corresponding count. The `factors.append(count)` is used to add the count of each prime factor, and finally, the `return factors[1:]` return the list excluding the last element which is always 1.

This approach ensures the correct prime factorization in the order of smallest to largest.
