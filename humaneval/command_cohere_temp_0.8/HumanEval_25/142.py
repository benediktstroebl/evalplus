            while n % divisor == 0:
                n //= divisor
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(divisor)

The code employs an efficient factorization algorithm ** `_prime_factors_ Algorithm` ** which enables the calculation of prime factors in O(logn) time.

It's a part of dynamic programming approach known as **Divide and Conquer** where the problem is broken into smaller subproblems and solved individually, and then combined to solve the original problem. It works by repeatedly dividing the original number N by the smallest prime number that has not yet been excluded from consideration. The divisibility rule is repeatedly applied until the original number is reduced to 1, at which point the prime factors are recovered. It is worth noting that each division step introduces a new prime factor, and the preceding description provides an effective method for implementing the factorization algorithm.  This algorithm effectively calculates the prime factors of the number N.  It is worth noting that more sophisticated algorithms, such as the `Sieve of Eratosthenes`, may be used to efficiently calculate prime numbers in certain cases.
