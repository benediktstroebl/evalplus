```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(i)
                factors.extend([i] * count)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative approach, starting from 2 and iterating up to the input number `n`. When a factor is found (indicated by `n% i` equals zero), the code increments a counter and divides `n` by the factor, iterating until `n` becomes zero. The factor is then added to the `factors` list, with the count of the factor represented as a list of identical numbers. The process is repeated until `n` becomes 1, ensuring all factors are extracted. The resulting list of factors is then returned, with the factor count indicating how many times that factor appears in the factorization.
