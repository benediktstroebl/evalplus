```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for divisor in range(2, n):
        if n % divisor == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % divisor == 0:
                n //= divisor
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(divisor)
                factors.extend([divisor] * count)
    if n > 1: 
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an efficient and algorithmic approach to factorization. It begins by looping through divisors from 2 up to the input number itself. For each divisor, it checks if the input number is divisible by it, using the modulus operator (`%`). If divisible, it initializes a count for that divisor and enters a nested loop to repeatedly divide the number by the divisor, and increment the count for that divisor each time. 

After the nested loop, the code adds the divisor and its corresponding count to the factors list. It then iterates through the list of factors, dividing the number by each divisor as many times as it appears in the factorization (as counted in the nested loop). It then adds the remaining factor (if any) to the list. 

The list of factors is then returned, ordered from smallest to largest. Test cases are also included in the code to ensure its effectiveness and correctness.
