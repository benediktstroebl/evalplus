```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(i)
                factors.extend([i] * count)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code uses a simple iterative approach to determine the prime factors of the input number `n` and organizes them in the order from smallest to largest. It loops from `2` up to `n-1` to check for each potential prime factor, if `n` is divisible by it. Once a factor is found, it divides `n` by this factor as many times as possible to update `n` and counts how many times this factor occurs in the factorization. This process continues until `n` becomes 1, at which point all prime factors have been found and the count of how many times each factor appears in the factorization is stored in the `factors` list. Lastly, if `n` remains greater than 1 at the end of the loop, this indicates that `n` is a prime number itself, so it is appended to the `factors` list.
