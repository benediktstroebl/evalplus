```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It starts by iterating from 2 up to `n-1` to check for divisibility. In each iteration, it checks if the current number is prime by iterating from 2 up to the square root of the number. If the number is found to be prime, it is added to the `factors` list, and then the code repeatedly divides `n` by the prime factor until `n` is completely factorized. 

To ensure correctness, the code excludes numbers greater than `n-1` from the factorization process, as any factors of `n` would already have been found by the time `i` reaches the value of `n-1`. 

The given tests are meant to ensure the correctness of the function, confirming that the returned list of prime factors accurately represents the input number in terms of both composition and order. 

```python
def test_factorize_correctness():
    assert factorize(8) == [2, 2, 2]
    assert factorize(25) == [5, 5]
    assert factorize(70) == [2, 5, 7]

def test_factorize_efficiency():
    assert factorize(120) == [2, 2, 3, 5]
    assert factorize(252) == [2, 2, 3, 7]
``` 

These tests check if the `factorize` function provides the correct prime factors for different input numbers, fulfilling the given problem's criteria regarding both correctness and efficiency.
