```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for divisor in range(2, n):
        if n % divisor == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % divisor == 0:
                n //= divisor
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(divisor)
                factors.extend([divisor] * count)
    if n > 1: 
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs a comprehensive factorization approach to solve the problem. It initiates by iterating through potential divisors, beginning from 2 and spanning up to, but not including, the input number itself. It determines whether the input number is divisible by the current divisor, and if it is, the divisibility is confirmed by repeatedly subtracting the divisor from the input number, incrementing a count variable to track the number of occurrences of that divisor in the factorization. The count is then used to determine the number of times the divisor is added to the factors list, either as a single unit or repeated multiple times corresponding to its count. Once all divisors are located and their counts computed, the factors list is appended with the remaining input number, ensuring that each factor is listed in its proper order and with the appropriate count. 

To test this, the following inputs could be used: 
```python
>>> factorize(8)
[2, 2, 2]
>>> factorize(25)
[5, 5]
>>> factorize(70)
[2, 5, 7]
``` 
This should output the list of prime factors for each input, each factorized number represented the appropriate number of times.
