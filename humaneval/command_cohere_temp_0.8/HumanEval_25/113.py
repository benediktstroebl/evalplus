```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It begins by iterating from 2 up to `n-1` to check for prime factors. Within each iteration, the code checks if the current number `i` is prime by iterating from 2 up to `i-1` to determine if any divisors exist. If `i` is determined to be prime, it is added to the `factors` list, and the loop continues until `n` is divisible by `i`. This process ensures that each prime factor is explored, and the number is factored correctly. Ultimately, the function returns the list of prime factors. 
```python
def factorize(n):
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors

# Test cases
assert factorize(8) == [2, 2, 2]
assert factorize(25) == [5, 5]
assert factorize(70) == [2, 5, 7]
