```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It begins by assuming that `n` is not divisible by any number less than or equal to its current value. This assumption is essential for streamlining the process by eliminating the need for factoring out multiples of small primes continuously. The cycle continues until the while loop eventually yields the largest prime factor of `n`. The function is geared towards efficiency, making use of the mathematical principle that an integer's prime factors will not change if it is updated by a smaller prime factor.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> factorize(8)
[2, 2, 2]
>>> factorize(25)
[5, 5]
>>> factorize(70)
[2, 5, 7]
```
In these examples, the function effectively identifies the prime factors of the given integers, returning them in ascending order, with each factor listed the number of times it appears in the factorization.
