```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given number `n`. It starts by assuming that `n` is prime and initially considers factors that are less than `n` and iterates from 2 up to `n-1`. If the factorization of a number leaves no remainder, it is prime. Otherwise, the smallest divisor that yields a remainder is appended to the list of factors, and the division is repeatedly performed until `n` is no longer divisible. The resulting list of factors is returned, with each factor listed the number of times it appears in the factorization. 
The code is self-contained and can be executed as a standalone Python script. It also adheres to the specified function signature, returning a list of integers representing the prime factors of the input number, ordered from smallest to largest, with each factor repeated accordingly.
