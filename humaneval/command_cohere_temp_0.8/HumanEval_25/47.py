```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for divisor in range(2, n):
        if n % divisor == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % divisor == 0:
                n //= divisor
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(divisor)
                factors.extend([divisor] * count)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The factorization process is done iteratively by checking divisibility by integers starting from 2 up to `n` itself. When a divisor is found, the number is divided by that divisor `n //= divisor` and the divisor adds to the `factors` list with the number of times it divides the `n`, this is done using the `count` variable. This process continues until `n` becomes 1, at which point the loop stops. The resulting list `factors` contains all prime factors in ascending order, and since the list allows duplicates, each factor is recorded the number of times it appears in the factorization. 

This approach ensures that the factors are extracted correctly and efficiently, in accordance with the problem description. And the function adheres to the type hinting convention with the `from typing import List` import statement and the return type annotation of `List[int]`.
