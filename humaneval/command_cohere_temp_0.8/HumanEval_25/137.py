```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_factor = n % i == 0
        if is_factor:
            factors.append(i)
            while is_factor:
                n //= i
                is_factor = n % i == 0
                if is_factor:
                    factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an efficient factorization algorithm **that iterates through integers from 2 up to the input number n**, it checks if the current integer is a factor of n, if it is, the integer is appended to the list of factors. The algorithm then proceeds to divide n by the previous factor and repeats the process until n becomes 1. Additionally, the algorithm handles the case where **n remains greater than 1** after the loop, in which it includes n as a factor. This approach ensures the efficiency of the algorithm and allows it to compute the prime factors in a straightforward manner.
