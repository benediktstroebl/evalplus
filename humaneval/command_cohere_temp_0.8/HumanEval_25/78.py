The function 'prime_factors' calculates the prime factors of the given number in the order from the smallest to the largest. The function 'factorize' uses 'prime_factors' and returns the list of factors with the number of occurrences of each factor in the factorization of the input number. The validation of the output is done by calculating the product of the factors and comparing it with the input number.
