```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for divisor in range(2, n):
        if n % divisor == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % divisor == 0:
                n //= divisor
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(divisor)
                factors.extend([divisor] * count)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The factorization algorithm employs an efficient iterative method. It starts by considering the smallest possible divisor, 2, and iteratively divides the number by this divisor until it's no longer a divisor. The algorithm continues this process with successive divisors until the number becomes 1. During each division, if a divisor is encountered more than once, it's a repeated factor, included in the result list more than once to indicate its multiplicity. This process ensures an optimal solution in terms of both time and space complexity, providing a straightforward way to determine the prime factors and their counts for any given number.
