    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_factor = n % i == 0
        if is_factor:
            factors.append(i)
            while is_factor:
                n //= i
                is_factor = n % i == 0
                if is_factor:

The code employs an efficient factorization algorithm **called Trial Division** to find the prime factors of an integer. It iterates through integers from 2 up to the input number 'n', and for each integer, it checks if it is a factor of 'n' (i.e., n% i == 0). If it is, the integer is appended to the factors list. Then, it performs a recursive division step, dividing 'n' by the current factor as long as it is a factor. This way, each prime factor is listed only once in the result, and the input assurance that the result is correct is ensured.
