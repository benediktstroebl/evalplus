```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code uses a simple approach to find the prime factors of an integer `n`. It iterates through numbers from 2 up to `n` and checks if each number is prime using a nested loop. If a number is prime, it is added to the `factors` list and the remaining value of `n` is divided by that number until `n` becomes 1. The resulting list of prime factors is then returned. 

Such an approach provides a naive algorithm for solving the factorization problem. It has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the nested loops checking for primality. There are more efficient algorithms, such as the `prime_factorization` function in the `math` module of Python, that are built on top of more efficient primality testing algorithms and factorization algorithms, but the given approach is straightforward and often performs well in practice for small values of `n`.  This makes it an excellent starting point for solving the problem.
