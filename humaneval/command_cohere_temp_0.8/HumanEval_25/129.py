```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It starts by iterating from `2` up to `n-1` to check for divisibility. In each iteration, it checks if the current number is prime by iterating from `2` to the square root of the number. If the number is not divisible by any integer within this range, it is deemed prime. Consequently, the number is added to the list of prime factors, and the `n` is updated by repeatedly dividing it by the current prime factor. The process continues until `n` becomes 1, at which point the list of prime factors is returned. 

Here is an example usage of the code:
```python
factorize(8)  # [2, 2, 2]
factorize(25)  # [5, 5]
factorize(70)  # [2, 5, 7]
``` 

This approach optimizes the process of determining prime factors by avoiding unnecessary computations. It is worth noting that alternative approaches exist, such as the `math.sqrt()` function to calculate the square root to define the range for primality testing. 
However, the current implementation avoids over-engineering and remains focused on solving the problem efficiently without unnecessary complexities.
