    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
    if n > 1:

    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It begins by assuming that `n` is not divisible by any number less than or equal to its current value. This assumption is validated by attempting to divide `n` by each integer from 2 up to `n` itself. If a divisor is found, it indicates that `n` is not a prime, and the algorithm resets `n` to exclude this divisor from further consideration. Otherwise, if no divisor is found after exhausting the range, `n` remains as a prime factor.

The output is a list of prime factors, sorted in ascending order, where each factor is listed in correspondence to its occurrence in the factorization. Consequently, the code efficiently computes the prime factors of the given integer `n`.
