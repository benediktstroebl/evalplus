```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(i)
                factors.append(count)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
        factors.append(1)
    return factors[1:]
```
The factorize function iterates through numbers from 2 up to the given input number n. 
It identifies prime factors and their corresponding counts, subsequently storing them in a list. The final list of factors is returned, with the count of how many times each appears in the factorization. The overall time complexity is O(sqrt(n)), supplemented by an auxiliary space of O(n).
