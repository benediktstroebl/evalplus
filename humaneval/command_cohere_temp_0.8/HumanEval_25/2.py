```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(i)
                factors.append(count)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
        factors.append(1)
    return factors[1:]
```

The factorization process is done iteratively, checking the divisibility of the number `n` from `2` up to `n - 1`. 

When a divisor is found (indicated by the expression `n % i == 0`), the code enters a nested loop that effectively conducts a `prime factorization` step, repeatedly dividing `n` by the current potential prime factor (`i`) until it is no longer divisible by it. The `count` variable keeps track of how many times that prime factor appears in the factorization.

Once the outer loop concludes or if `n` is a prime number larger than 2, the function appends the prime factors (or `n` itself if it's a prime) and their corresponding counts to the `factors` list. To ensure the list doesn't contain any zeros (due to the division counts), it excludes the first element, which represents the prime factor's count. Consequently, the function returns the list `factors[1:]`.
