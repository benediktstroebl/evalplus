```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(i)
                factors.extend([i] * count)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The factorization process is done iteratively, checking the divisibility of the number `n` from 2 up to `n` itself. When a divisor is found, the internal `count` variable keeps track of how many times that divisor appears in the factorization. During each iteration of the loop, the number `n` is divided by the divisor as many times as possible to achieve its simplest form. The divisor is then added to the `factors` list with the amount of times it appears. After checking all possible divisors, if `n` is greater than 1, it means that a part of the number remained uncircumscribed by any divisor, and this remaining part is added to the `factors` list. Lastly, the function returns the list of factors. 

This approach provides an efficient and concise solution to the problem, fulfilling the challenge's requirements.
