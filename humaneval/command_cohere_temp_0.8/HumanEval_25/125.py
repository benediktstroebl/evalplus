```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(i)
                factors.append(count)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
        factors.append(1)
    return factors[1:]
```
The factorization process is done iteratively, starting from 2 and dividing the number by the current potential factor as many times as it divides evenly. The potential factors and their corresponding counts are added to the list of factors. After completing the loop, the list of factors is returned, with the count of appearances for each factor removed, to match the specified order from smallest to largest. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> factorize(8)
[2, 2, 2]
>>> factorize(25)
[5, 5]
>>> factorize(70)
[2, 5, 7]
```
This should match the expected output as described in the problem statement.
