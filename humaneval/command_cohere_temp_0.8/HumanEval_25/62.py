```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for divisor in range(2, n):
        if n % divisor == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % divisor == 0:
                n //= divisor
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(divisor)
                factors.extend([divisor] * count)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given integer `n`. Firstly, it iterates through all divisors from 2 up to `n` (excluding `n` itself since it's irrational). It verifies if the current divisor can divide the number, and if it can, the divisor is appended to the `factors` list. The division is performed multiple times until the divisor is no longer a factor, effectively calculating the power of the divisor in the number. This ensures that each factor is listed the appropriate number of times. Finally, after looping through all divisors, if `n` is greater than 1 (meaning it has not been fully factored out by the previous loop), it is added to the list of factors.
