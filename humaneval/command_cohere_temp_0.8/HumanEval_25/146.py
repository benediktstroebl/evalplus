```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for divisor in range(2, n):
        if n % divisor == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % divisor == 0:
                n //= divisor
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(divisor)
                factors.extend([divisor] * count)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an efficient factorization algorithm. It starts by checking divisors from 2 up to `n`, progressively dividing `n` by these divisors if they are factors. When a divisor is a factor, it keeps dividing `n` by that divisor until it's completely factored out. It tracks the count of occurrences of each divisor, ensuring the factor list's accuracy. Lastly, if `n` remains greater than 1, it adds `n` itself as a unique factor. This methodical approach ensures both correctness and efficiency in factoring.
