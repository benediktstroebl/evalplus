```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for divisor in range(2, n):
        if n % divisor == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % divisor == 0:
                n //= divisor
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(divisor)
                factors.extend([divisor] * count)
    if n > 1: 
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
The factorization algorithm implemented in `factorize` function attempts to factorize a given number `n` by iteratively dividing it by integers from 2 up to `n` itself. It keeps dividing the number by the same divisor as many times as it can until it becomes equal to this divisor. The divisors in which the number was divided are appended to the `factors` list, along with the respective count of how many times each divisor was found. Once the while loop completes, the division by a divisor can no longer be performed, and the remaining number, which is greater than 1, is appended to `factors` as well. The function returns the `factors` list.
