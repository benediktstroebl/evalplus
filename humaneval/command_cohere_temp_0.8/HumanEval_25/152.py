```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
    if n > 1:

    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It begins by assuming that `n` is not divisible by any number less than or equal to its current value. This assumption is validated by attempting to divide `n` by each integer from 2 up to `n` itself. In the event that a division is found, the suspect number is appended to the `factors` list, and the division operation is repeated until `n` is no longer divisible by the suspect number. This process is repeated for each potential factor, ensuring that all prime factors are identified and counted appropriately. Ultimately, the function returns the `factors` list, which represents the prime factors of `n` in ascending order, each accompanied by its corresponding exponent indicating how many times it appears in the factorization.
