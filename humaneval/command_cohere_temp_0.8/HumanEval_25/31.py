```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_factor = n % i == 0
        if is_factor:
            factors.append(i)
            while is_factor:
                n //= i
                is_factor = n % i == 0
                if is_factor:
                    factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an optimized approach, trying to divide `n` by the smallest potential prime factor at each iteration, which reduces the number of divisions needed to find all the factors. The loop initiates from `2` and incrementally moves up to the square root of the input number. 

For each discovered factor, it appends it to the `factors` list and divides `n` by it to continue searching for the next potential factor. This method helps reduce the number of divisions needed, making it more efficient compared to a straightforward brute-force approach that iterates over integers from 1 to the input number.
