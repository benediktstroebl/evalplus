```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for divisor in range(2, n):
        if n % divisor == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % divisor == 0:
                n //= divisor
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(divisor)
                factors.extend([divisor] * count)
    if n > 1: 
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The factorization is done iteratively by dividing the number n by divisor until it becomes 1. To ensure that each prime factor is listed only once in the output (even if it had a greater number of occurrences), the code extends the list with the same factor as many times as its occurrence.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```python
>>> factorize(8)
[2, 2, 2]
>>> factorize(25)
[5, 5]
>>> factorize(70)
[2, 5, 7]
```
