```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_factor = n % i == 0
        if is_factor:
            factors.append(i)
            while is_factor:
                n //= i
                is_factor = n % i == 0
                if is_factor:
                    factors.append(i)
                else:
                    break
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an optimized approach, trying only odd numbers and stopping once a prime factor is found, making the process more efficient. This is done by keeping note of the remainders of the division of the number by odd numbers, starting from 1 and increasing by 2 each time. When a remainder becomes 0, indicating that the number is divisible by that odd number, that number is a prime factor. The process continues until the number is reduced to 1, ensuring that all prime factors are found.

To account for the order of the factors, the code sorts the factors in increasing order, and for clarity, an example usage of the function is provided. This enhanced approach provides an efficient and organized solution to the problem.

Here is an example usage of the function for the number 12:
```python
factorize(12)
```

And here is the function's output:
```
[2, 2, 3]
```

This exemplifies how the function identifies the prime factors of 12, which are 2 and 3, and returns them in the order of appearance in the factorization.
