```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if n % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It starts by iterating from 2 up to `n-1` to check for prime factors. Within this loop, another loop iterates from 2 up to the current factor value to see if there are any divisors. If the `n` is divisible by the current factor, it implies that the factor isn't prime, and the loop terminates. Only when the inner loop completes without finding a divisor, the current factor is appended to the `factors` list.

The code ensures that each prime factor is included in the list only once, in ascending order. Additionally, it verifies that the input number is consistent with the product of all the identified factors.
