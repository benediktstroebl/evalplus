    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
    if n > 1:

    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It begins by initializing an empty list called `factors`, intended to hold the prime factors, which will be produced once the loop completes. The loop iterates through numbers from 2 up to `n` itself. For each number `i`, the code assesses its primality by checking if it can be evenly divided by any integer between 2 and `i`. If such a divisor is found, `is_prime` is marked as False, indicating that `i` is not a prime number. However, if `i` does not have any divisors within this range, it is deemed prime, and it is added to the `factors` list.

Subsequently, the code employs a second loop to further divide `n` by the prime factor found in the previous step, repeated until `n` is no longer divisible. This loop ensures that each prime factor is represented in the list the number of times it appears in the factorization of `n`. Finally, if `n` remains greater than 1, an additional factor equal to `n` is appended to the `factors` list.

In summary, the code adopts a loop-driven approach to identify the prime factors of `n`, filtering out non-prime numbers while factoring `n`. The output is a list containing prime factors, with each factor appearing the corresponding number of times it exists in the factorization of the input number.
