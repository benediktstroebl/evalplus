```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_factor = n % i == 0
        if is_factor and i != 1:
            factors.append(i)
            while is_factor:
                n //= i
                is_factor = n % i == 0
            if n == 1:
                break
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an efficient factorization algorithm **that iterates from 2 to the input number n** and factors out each prime factor progressively. It verifies each number for the property of being a factor and, if found to be true, appends it to the list of factors whilst also iteratively dividing the number by the prime factor discovered. This method ensures that the prime factors are extracted in the order from smallest to largest, with each non-prime factor being factored out as it is discovered. Additionally, the algorithm is optimized to terminate once all prime factors are identified, thus preventing any unnecessary iterations.
