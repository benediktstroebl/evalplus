```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for divisor in range(2, n):
        if n % divisor == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % divisor == 0:
                n //= divisor
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(divisor)
                factors.extend([divisor] * count)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code utilizes a simple optimization to limit the number of divisions performed by checking if the remaining quotient is divisible by the same number that resulted in the zero quotient on the previous iteration. This allows avoiding redundant iterations for the same factor.
