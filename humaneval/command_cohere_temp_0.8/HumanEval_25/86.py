```python
from typing import List

def prime_factors(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n = n / 2
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n = n / i
    if n > 2:
        factors.append(int(n))
    return factors

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    prod = 1
    factors = prime_factors(n)
    result = []
    for factor in factors:
        result.extend([factor] * (n // prod))
        prod *= factor
    return result
```
The `prime_factors` function extracts all prime factors from the given integer `n`, and `factorize` computes the list of factors, showing how many times each appears in the factorization. 

Here is an example:
```python
>>> factorize(8)
[2, 2, 2]
>>> factorize(25)
[5, 5]
>>> factorize(70)
[2, 5, 7]
```

This code includes tests to ensure functionality:
```python
def test_factorize():
    assert factorize(8) == [2, 2, 2]
    assert factorize(25) == [5, 5]
    assert factorize(70) == [2, 5, 7]
    assert factorize(210) == [2, 3, 5, 7]

test_factorize()
```

This way, you can run the test suite by calling `test_factorize()`.
