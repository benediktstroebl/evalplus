```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_factor = n % i == 0
        if is_factor and i != 1:
            factors.append(i)
            while is_factor:
                n //= i
                is_factor = n % i == 0
            if n == 1:
                break
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an optimized approach utilizing the `range()` function and `is_factor` condition. It iterates from `2` up to the input number and checks if the current number is a factor of the input. If it is, the number is added to the `factors` list and the input number is divided by the current number until the remaining number is no longer a factor. This way, the code efficiently determines the prime factors and their corresponding counts in the factorization process.
