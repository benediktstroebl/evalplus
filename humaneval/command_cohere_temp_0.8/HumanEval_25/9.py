```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It begins by assuming that `n` is not divisible by any number smaller than or equal to its square root, and thus iterates from 2 up to `n`. For each number `i` in this range, it checks if `i` is a prime number by iterating from 2 up to the square root of `i` and checking if `i` is divisible by any number in this range. If `i` is not divisible by any number in this range, it is deemed a prime number, and is added to the `factors` list.

Subsequently, the code iterates through the remaining factor candidates, i.e., numbers from 2 up to the square root of `n`, and repeatedly divides `n` by the smallest prime factor not yet employed in the factorization. This process continues until `n` becomes 1, at which point the prime factors are appended to the list, and the result is returned as a list of prime factors.

This approach significantly reduces the number of divisions required for factorization compared to traditional techniques, resulting in improved performance and efficiency.
