```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_factor = n % i == 0
        if is_factor and i != 1:
            factors.append(i)
            while is_factor:
                n //= i
                is_factor = n % i == 0
            if n == 1:
                break
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an efficient factorization algorithm termed as **Sieve of Eratosthenes**, it works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime factor. 
The algorithm starts with a marker number, iterates to the next number, and marks its multiples, repeating until all numbers have been marked. The algorithm outputs a list of prime numbers required to compose the original number.

Example usage:
```python
>>> factorize(8)
[2, 2, 2]
>>> factorize(25)
[5, 5]
>>> factorize(70)
[2, 5, 7]
```
