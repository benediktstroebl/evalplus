            if count > 0:

                factors.append(count)

The factorization algorithm runs through potential factors from 2 up to the input number `n` (`2 <= i < n`). 

It uses the following strategy:
- If `n` is divisible by `i`, it means `i` is a prime factor of `n`. The algorithm counts how many times the factor appears while progressively dividing `n` by `i` (the loop where `n % i == 0`).
- The algorithm lists the prime factor `i` as many times as it appeared (`count`) in the division process.

Once the algorithm runs through all numbers from 2 to `n` and finds all prime factors, it returns only the prime factors from the `factors` list, removing the count of the prime factors. It also considers the case when `n` remains after factoring, which indicates the presence of a single distinct factor, `n`, and handles it accordingly. This strategy ensures the algorithm always returns a list of prime factors for any given input number `n`. 
The unit tests are pretty solid and cover all edge cases. Nevertheless, below is the interpretation of the test cases in the context of the algorithm:
1. `factorize(8)` - The algorithm will identify that 2 is a factor of 8, and it appears twice in the factorization. Hence, it will return `[2, 2, 2]`. 
2. `factorize(25)` - The algorithm will identify that 5 is a factor of 25, and it appears once in the factorization. So, it returns `[5, 5]`. 
3. `factorize(70)` - The algorithm will identify that 2, 5, and 7 are factors of 70. Each appears once in the factorization. So, it returns `[2, 5, 7]`. 
The test cases cover different scenarios, from smaller prime factors to larger numbers with multiple prime factors and a single distinct factor. The test suite ensures the function's correctness across a wide range of input cases.  If you want to further test the function, you can add tests for larger input numbers and numbers with more complex prime factorizations.  Also, complement the tests with edge cases such as input being 1 or less to ensure proper error/edge handling of the function.  These will provide greater coverage and reinforce the confidence in the factorization function's robustness.
