```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It starts by iterating from 2 up to `n-1` to check for prime factors. Within each iteration, the code checks if the current number `i` is prime by iterating from 2 up to `i-1` to look for divisors. If `i` is determined to be prime, it's added to the list of factors, and then the code repeatedly divides `n` by `i` until `n` is no longer divisible by `i`. This process ensures that all prime factors are captured. Lastly, the result is a list of factors in ascending order, as the last step ensures that each factor is listed the number of times it appears in the factorization.
