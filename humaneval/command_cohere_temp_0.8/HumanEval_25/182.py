            while n % divisor == 0:
                n //= divisor

            if count > 0:

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of an integer `n`. Initially, a `factor` list is initialized, and the loop iterates through `divisors` ranging from 2 up to `n`. When a `divisor` is found to evenly divide `n`, the integer's division by this `divisor` is repeatedly performed while keeping track of the count using the `count` variable. If the count is greater than zero, meaning the divisor has been multiplied more than once, the `divisor` is added to the `factors` list, and the count of this divisor is extended using the `extend` function. This process ensures that each factor is included in the list the exact number of times it appears in the factorization of the integer `n`. The algorithm concludes by checking if `n` is greater than 1, ensuring that `n` is included in the `factors` list if it has not been divided by any other factors. This factorization method efficiently computes the prime factors in descending order, yielding a list where each factor is repeated accordingly.
