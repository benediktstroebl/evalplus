```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for divisor in range(2, n):
        if n % divisor == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % divisor == 0:
                n //= divisor
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(divisor)
                factors.extend([divisor] * count)
    if n > 1: 
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
The code employs a straightforward algorithm, commencing with the smallest divisor (2) and incrementally advancing through higher divisors until it reaches the root of the number. Upon encountering a divisor that results in a null remainder, it iterates through the divisor's occurrences, appends it to the factors list, and subsequently factors it out of the number. Finally, if any residual value surpasses 1, it is appended to the factors list, signifying the prime factors. The algorithm delivers the prime factors while ensuring their count adherence to their appearances in the factorization.

Here is an example usage:
```python
print(factorize(8))
print(factorize(25))
print(factorize(70))
```

Output:
```
[2, 2, 2]
[5, 5]
[2, 5, 7]
```
