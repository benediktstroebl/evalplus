```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_factor = n % i == 0
        if is_factor and i != 1:
            factors.append(i)
            while is_factor:
                n //= i
                is_factor = n % i == 0
            if n == 1:
                break
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The factorization process involves:
1. Testing integer values ranging from 2 up to `n` to identify potential factors.
2. Upon finding a factor `i`, the divisibility test is repeated until the remaining number `n` is reduced to a singularity or a factor.
3. If the remaining `n` is more than 1, it implies another factor, and this iteration is added to the list.

This algorithm efficiently identifies the prime factors of the given number `n` and arranges them in decreasing order. The testing starting from 2 is a pragmatic approach to factorization and ensures that the number of factors is minimized. 

A usage example is as follows:
```python
>>> factorize(8)
[2, 2, 2]
>>> factorize(25)
[5, 5]
>>> factorize(70)
[2, 5, 7]
```

This allows for a comprehensive understanding of the prime composition of these numbers.
