```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It begins by assuming that `n` is not divisible by any number less than or equal to its current value. This assumption is validated by examining each integer between 2 and `i` for divisibility. If none of these numbers divide evenly into `i`, it is designated as a prime number. Subsequently, the prime factor is appended to the list of factors, and the algorithm repeatedly divides `n` by this factor until it is no longer divisible. The process continues until `n` is reduced to 1, at which point the prime factors are appended to the list, and the result is returned. 

Here is an example usage:
```python
>>> factorize(8)
[2, 2, 2]
>>> factorize(25)
[5, 5]
>>> factorize(70)
[2, 5, 7]
```
