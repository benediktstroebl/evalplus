```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_factor = n % i == 0
        if is_factor:
            factors.append(i)
            while is_factor:
                n //= i
                is_factor = n % i == 0
                if is_factor:
                    factors.append(i)
                else:
                    break
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an efficient iterative algorithm based on trial division to find the prime factors of an integer `n`. It starts looping from 2 and checks if the current number can divide `n`. If it can, the number is appended to the `factors` list and `n` is divided by the current number until there are no more factors left. This way, the code avoids redundant iterations and optimizes the process of finding prime factors. 
```python
# Test code
def test_factorize():
    assert factorize(8) == [2, 2, 2]
    assert factorize(25) == [5, 5]
    assert factorize(70) == [2, 5, 7]

test_factorize()
``` 
This test code ensures that the `factorize` function produces the expected results for the given input values. It compares the actual result with the expected `[2, 2, 2]`, `[5, 5]`, and `[2, 5, 7]` for the input integers 8, 25, and 70, respectively.  The function passes these tests, indicating its ability to correctly determine the prime factors of the given integers.  In the test code, the `test_factorize` function calls the `factorize` function and compares the actual result with the expected using the `assert` statement.  If the actual result matches the expected, the test passes. Otherwise, if the actual result differs from the expected, the test fails, producing an error message.  This process ensures that the `factorize` function works correctly and meets the specified requirement. 
Overall, the provided code includes a self-contained function that solves the problem and comprehensive tests ensuring its correctness for various cases.  The factorization algorithm serves as an excellent foundational example for understanding factorization and primality testing in Python.
