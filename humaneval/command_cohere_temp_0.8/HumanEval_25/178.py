```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_factor = n % i == 0
        if is_factor and i != n // i:
            factors.append(i)
            while is_factor:
                n //= i
                is_factor = n % i == 0
                if is_factor:
                    factors.append(i)
        elif i == n // i:
            factors.append(i)
    return factors
```

The code employs an optimized factorization algorithm specifically designed for faster performance. Initially, it iterates through factors from 2 up to `n`, which is the threshold for prime checking. This approach eliminates the need for checking prime status for numbers exceeding `n`.

During the process, it keeps track of repeated factors by using a `while` loop. This efficient method allows us to detect and incorporate repeated factors into the resulting list of factors. Ultimately, the function furnishes a list of prime factors, ordered from smallest to largest, representing the input integer `n`.
