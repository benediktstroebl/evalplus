```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given number `n`. It starts by assuming the number is prime and iterates from 2 up to the number itself. For each iteration, the code checks if the current number is divisible by any integer between 2 and the square root of the number. If it is not, the variable `is_prime` remains `True`, indicating that the number is prime. However, if the number is divisible by any integer within this range, `is_prime` is set to `False`, signifying that the number is not prime.

Consequently, if `is_prime` remains `True` after the loop, it means that the number is prime, and it is appended to the `factors` list. The code then proceeds to check if the remaining divisor of the number is 1, indicating that the number has been fully factorized. If it is not 1, the remaining divisor is appended to the `factors` list. Ultimately, the function returns the `factors` list, which represents the prime factors of the given number.
