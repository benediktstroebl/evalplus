```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It starts by iterating from 2 up to the given number `n`. For each number, it checks if it is prime by iterating from 2 up to the candidate factor itself. If the candidate factor is prime, it is added to the list of factors. Then, the code iterates through the factors and divides `n` by each of them until `n` becomes 1. The resulting list of factors is then returned, representing the prime factors in ascending order, with each factor listed the number of times it appears in the factorization.
