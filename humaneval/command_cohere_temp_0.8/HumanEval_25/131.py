```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It starts by iterating from 2 up to `n-1` to check each integer as a potential factor. Within the nested loop, it checks if the potential factor is prime by iterating from 2 up to the potential factor itself. If the potential factor is divisible by any integer within this range, it is deemed not prime and breaks out of the nested loop. Otherwise, if the potential factor is not divisible by any number and is greater than 1, it is a prime factor.

The prime factor is then added to the `factors` list, and the code continues by iterating through the digits of `n` and repeatedly dividing `n` by the prime factor until `n` is no longer divisible. This process ensures that each prime factor is counted the appropriate number of times in the list of factors. The final result is a list of prime factors sorted from smallest to largest, where each factor represents the number of times it appears in the factorization of the original input number `n`.
