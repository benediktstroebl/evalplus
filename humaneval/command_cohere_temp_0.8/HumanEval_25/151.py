The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It begins by assuming that `n` is not divisible by any number less than or equal to its current value. This assumption is validated by examining all integers up to `n` to determine if they can divide `n` without leaving a remainder. If a divisor is found, the assumption is false, and the algorithm resets `n` to the divisor and resumes searching for factors from this new starting point. The process is repeated until `n` is divisible only by itself and 1, at which point the prime factors are extracted and returned in ascending order, with each factor appearing the corresponding number of times it divides `n`.
