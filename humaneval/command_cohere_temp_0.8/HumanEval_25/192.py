```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(i)
                factors.extend([i] * count)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative approach, starting from 2 and iterating up to the square root of the input number `n`, to determine the prime factors of `n`. It verifies if `i` is a factor of `n` and if it is, it calculates the number of times `i` appears in the factorization andtracks this number in a `count`. Subsequently, the code recursively divides `n` by `i` and repeats the process until `n` is reduced to zero. 

If `count` is greater than zero, it means `i` is a prime factor of `n`, so it gets appended to the `factors` list, and the count of times it appears is extended to the list as well. This process ensures that each factor is included in the list the precise number of times it appears in the factorization. Once all factors are located, the code examines if `n` is larger than 1 and if it is, it adds `n` as a sole factor. 

The function outputs a list of prime factors, with each factor repeated the corresponding number of times it appears in the factorization of the number. Overall, this code achieves the goal of determining and listing the prime factors in ascending order, with each factor displayed the number of times it contributes to the input number.
