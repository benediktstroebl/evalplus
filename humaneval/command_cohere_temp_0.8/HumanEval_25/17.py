The `prime_factors` function calculates the prime factors of the given number `n`, handling even and odd factors separately and collecting them in the order of their appearance in the factorization. Then the `factorize` function uses `prime_factors` to decompose number `n` into a list of factors where each factor is repeated according to its appearance in the `prime_factors` list. 
The `factorize` function is then tested on the examples provided in the prompt and should return:
- `[2, 2, 2]` for `factorize(8)`
- `[5, 5]` for `factorize(25)`
- `[2, 5, 7]` for `factorize(70)`
This approach ensures the factors are correctly computed and repeated according to their appearance in the factorization. 
The approach has a time complexity of `O(sqrt(n))` for each of the two main functions, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(sqrt(n)) for this solution. 
The resulting approach is efficient and straightforward, correctly solving the problem.
