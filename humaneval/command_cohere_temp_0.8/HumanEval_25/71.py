```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_factor = n % i == 0
        if is_factor:
            factors.append(i)
            while is_factor:
                n //= i
                is_factor = n % i == 0
                if is_factor:
                    factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an optimized approach, trying integers from 2 up to the input number `n`. When an integer `i` is found to be a factor, it's added to the `factors` list and the input number `n` is divided by `i` repeatedly until `n` is reduced to unity or another integer. If the reduced `n` is still greater than 1, it's added to the `factors` list. In this manner, the function provides a list of prime factors, each appearing as many times as it divides the original number, and the list is sorted in ascending order. 

Here is an example of how you can use the function to factorize the number 70:
```python
factorize(70)
# Output: [2, 5, 7]
``` 

This function stores the prime factors of the integer 70 as a list, with each factor appearing in the list the number of times it is a factor of 70. In this case, the factors are [2, 5, 7], meaning that 70 is 2 times smaller than 14, 5 times smaller than 14 and 7 times 1.
