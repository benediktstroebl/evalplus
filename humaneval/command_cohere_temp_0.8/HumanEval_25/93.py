    factors = []
    for divisor in range(2, n):
        if n % divisor == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % divisor == 0:
                n //= divisor
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(divisor)
                factors.extend([divisor] * count)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors

The code employs an efficient factorization algorithm based on divisibility checks. It iterates through potential divisors, starting from 2 and incrementing towards the square root of the input number. When a divisor is found, the code uses an iterative approach to divide the number and count the number of times the divisor appears in the factorization. The divisor is added to the factor list, and its count is ensured by extending the list. This process continues until the input number is reduced to 1, at which point the remaining factor is added to the list. The algorithm's time complexity is O(sqrt(N)), resulting in an efficient solution for finding the prime factors and their counts in the order of the smallest to the largest.
