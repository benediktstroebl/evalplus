The `prime_factors` function extracts all prime factors from an integer `n` and returns them in ascending order. The `factorize` function uses `prime_factors` to calculate all prime factors and their multiplicities, returning a list of factors sorted from smallest to largest and with each factor listed the number of times it appears in the factorization. The function is validated by the given tests. 
This approach aims to improve efficiency by detecting divisibility by 2 and odd numbers iteratively, reducing the range of divisors to consider.  optimized.
