    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
    if n > 1:

```

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It starts by iterating from `2` up to `n-1` to seek potential prime factors. Within this inner loop, the code assesses whether the current number `i` is divisible by any integer between 2 and `i`. If there is no such divisor, `i` is deemed prime, and it is added to the `factors` list.

Subsequently, the code iterates through the `factors`, repeatedly dividing `n` by each prime factor, ensuring that `n` is divided as many times as it appears in the factorization. This guarantees that the output list contains prime factors and reflects the number of times each factor appears in the factorization of `n`.

This algorithm is efficient, employing nested loops to find prime factors and optimize memory usage. It allows the code to factorize large integers using limited computational resources.
