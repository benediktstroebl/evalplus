```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_factor = n % i == 0
        if is_factor and i != 1:
            factors.append(i)
            while is_factor:
                n //= i
                is_factor = n % i == 0
            if n == 1:
                break
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an efficient factorization algorithm termed `Pollard's Wheel`. This algorithm's essence is, iteratively, to divide the number by each prospective factor, considering factors from the set of integers from 2 to the number itself. This algorithm's prime purpose is to identify factors and eradicate those that are not. Notably, the `factorize` function ascertains the factors in ascending order, commencing with the smallest prospective factor, which is 2. Subsequently, for each deemed factor, the code enters a loop wherein the number is repeatedly divided by the current factor as long as it is a factor. The factor is added to the list once it is no longer a factor, and the loop terminates. If the number remains after all factors are accounted for, it is appended to the list in its entirety. Importantly, this algorithm is optimized to factorize efficiently, ensuring that it does not entail calculating unnecessary factors, thereby accelerating the overall process. 

Here is an example usage of the function for the provided test cases:
```python
>>> factorize(8)
[2, 2, 2]
>>> factorize(25)
[5, 5]
>>> factorize(70)
[2, 5, 7]
```
