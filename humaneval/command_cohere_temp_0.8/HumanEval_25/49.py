The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It begins by assuming that `n` is not divisible by any number less than or equal to its current value. This assumption is then repeatedly tested for each integer between 2 and `i`. If the integer is divisible by any other number, the assumption is rejected, and the algorithm moves on to the next number. If not, the integer is added to the list of prime factors, and the algorithm continues until all divisors are extracted from `n`.  The resulting list contains all the prime factors of `n`, sorted from smallest to largest.  This method is efficient due to the early rejection of multiples of larger prime numbers, enabling quicker convergence to the fundamental factors.
