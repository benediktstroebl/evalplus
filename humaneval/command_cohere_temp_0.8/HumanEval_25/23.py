```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It starts by iterating from 2 up to `n-1` to check for divisibility. In each iteration, it checks if the current number is prime by iterating from 2 up to the square root of the number. If the number is prime, it's added to the `factors` list, and then the code repeatedly divides `n` by the current prime to exhaust its divisibility. Finally, any remaining factor of `n` that hasn't been divided away is also added to the list. This approach allows the code to efficiently factorize the number `n` by avoiding expensive factorization techniques.
