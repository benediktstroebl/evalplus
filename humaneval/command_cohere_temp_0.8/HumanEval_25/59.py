```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(i)
                factors.append(count)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
        factors.append(1)
    return factors[1:]
```

The code uses a simple approach to find the prime factors of an integer `n` by iterating from `2` up to `n` and dividing `n` by each prime factor. The code saves the prime factor and the number of times it appears in the factorization process. Finally, the function returns a list of the prime factors and their corresponding counts.  It also handles the case when `n` is just a single prime number and excludes the count of 1 in the list of factors. 

The unit tests of the problem statement are generally sufficient to ensure the correctness of the code against edge cases and corner cases. 
However, if you want to add additional tests considering wider ranges of input values, you may use the following additional tests:
```python
# Tests on edge cases
assert factorize(1) == []
assert factorize(0) == []

# Test on special numbers
assert factorize(3) == [3, 1]
assert factorize(7) == [7, 1]

# Test on numbers closer to the limits of the int type
assert factorize(2**15 - 1) == [3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71]
assert factorize(2**16 - 2) == [2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71]
``` A few additional tests covering different ranges of input values can help validate the robustness of the factorization function.  These tests are optional depending on the level of testing required and the available time and resources.
