```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(i)
                factors.append(count)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
        factors.append(1)
    return factors[1:]
```
The code uses a straightforward algorithm based on trial division. It iterates through numbers from 2 up to `n` and checks if they divide `n` without leaving a remainder. If a number `i` divides `n`, it performs a while loop to repeatedly divide `n` by `i` until it's not divisible. The algorithm further handles cases where `n` is prime, ensuring that `factors` contain the correct list of prime factors and their corresponding counts. 
The `factors` list is constructed to hold `[i, count]` pairs for each prime factor `i`, with the count denoting how many times that factor appears in the factorization. Finally, any composite factors (greater than 1 but not prime) are appended to the `factors` list, but they're excluded from the return value due to the line `return factors[1:]`.
