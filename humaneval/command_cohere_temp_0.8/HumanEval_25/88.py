```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(i)
                factors.append(count)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
        factors.append(1)
    return factors[1:]
```
The factorization algorithm is simple and works by iteratively dividing the number by the smallest potential prime factor and tracking how many times it divides evenly. The smallest potential prime factor is chosen by iterating from 2 up to the number itself. Once a factor is found, it is added to the list of factors with its corresponding count, and the division is done until there are no more full factors of that kind in the number. The process is repeated until the number is reduced to 1, ensuring that every factor is listed as many times as it appears in the factorization. The final list of factors is returned, excluding the count attribute, which is added as an optional parameter.
