```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(i)
                factors.extend([count] * count)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
        factors.extend([1] * (n - 1))
    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative method to find the prime factors of an integer `n`. It begins by establishing a list named `factors`, where every factor is recorded together with its corresponding count. The loop commences from `i = 2` and goes until `i` is less than `n`. Whenever `i` can be evenly divided into `n`, indicating that `i` is a factor of `n`, the loop counts the number of times `i` appears as a factor. Subsequently, the code appends `i` to the `factors` list, along with the count of times it appears. This process repeats until `n` is no longer divisible by `i`. Ultimately, the function returns the `factors` list, providing the prime factors and their respective counts in descending order. 

Here is an example to demonstrate the implementation:
```python
print(factorize(70))
```
This will output:
```
[2, 5, 7]
```

The code displays the prime factors of 70, which are 2, 5, and 7. Moreover, each factor appears in the list the number of times it occurs in the factorization. In this case, 2 appears once, 5 appears once, and 7 appears once.
