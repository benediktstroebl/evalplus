The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It starts by assuming the factors are empty and iterates through numbers from 2 up to `n` (inclusive). For each number `i`, it checks if `i` is prime by iterating from 2 up to the square root of `i`. If no divisors are found, `i` is prime, and it is added to the list of factors. Subsequently, the code iterates through the found factors and extracts each factor `i` from `n` as many times as possible, ensuring that `n` equals the product of all factors. The resulting factor list is returned, containing prime factors in ascending order, with each factor listed the number of times it appears in the factorization.  In the provided examples, the function returns the expected prime factors.
