The code first uses a `prime_factors` function to find the prime factors of the input number `n`, and then combines these prime factors to form the desired list `Factors`. 
The `prime_factors` function loops through potential prime factors, starting from 2 and moving up in odd increments. It divides `n` evenly by each potential prime factor, and when it can no longer divide `n`, that prime factor is added to the list of `factors`. The loop resumes searching for the next prime factor, until all prime factors are found.

The `factorize` function simply calls out the `prime_factors` function and returns the list of prime factors. 
The code is concise and efficient, and it should work for a wide range of input numbers `n`. It passes the tests provided as it returns the expected output for the sample inputs and satisfies the requirement for the returned list to contain only prime factors and the number `n` appears in the list as many times as it is a factor.
