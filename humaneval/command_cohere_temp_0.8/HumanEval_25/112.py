```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It begins by assuming that `n` is not divisible by any number less than or equal to its current value. This assumption is then systematically tested by checking if `n` is divisible by each integer from 2 up to its current value. Whenever a divisor is found, it is appended to a list of factors. The process continues until `n` is reduced to a single prime factor that cannot be further divided. The final list of factors is returned, representing the prime factorization of the original input number `n`. 

Here's an example to demonstrate the working of the above code:
```python
factorize(8)
# Output: [2, 2, 2]

factorize(25)
# Output: [5, 5]

factorize(70)
# Output: [2, 5, 7]
``` 

This iterative method guarantees efficient and effective prime factorization, making it a dependable solution for such problems.
