        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given number `n`. It begins by assuming the number to be divisible by `2` and progressively moves up `i` by `i` from `2` to `n - 1`. If the number is divisible by the current candidate factor `i`, it adds the factor to the list of factors and divides `n` by `i` until it has been completely factorized. The algorithm ends by checking if `n` is larger than `1` and, if so, including `n` as the last factor. This method is efficient due to its iterative nature, which eliminates the need for recurrent divisions that recursive solutions often incur.
