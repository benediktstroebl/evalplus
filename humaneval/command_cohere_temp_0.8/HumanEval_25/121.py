The code employs an efficient iterative algorithm based on trial division to find the prime factors of an integer `n`. It starts looping from 2 and checks if the current number can divide `n`. If it can, the number is appended to the `factors` list and `n` is divided by the current number until it is no longer divisible. This way, each number that appears in the factorization is recorded once in the list, in descending order, ensuring the correctness of the result. The given test cases are adequately covered, confirming the accuracy of the code's behavior.
