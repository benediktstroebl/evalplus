```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(i)
                factors.extend([i] * count)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative method to inspect each potential factor from 2 up to the input number `n`. It maintains a `count` variable to record the number of repetitions of a prime factor in the factorization, incrementing it whenever the current factor divides evenly into the number. In order to improve the efficiency of the computation, the divisibility check `n % i` is streamlined by tracking the `factors` that were already found.

If a factor is found, it's added to the `factors` list with the number of repetitions equal to the value of `count`. Once the factorization of `n` is completed, the function checks if any number greater than 1 is left, adding it to the list if necessary. This ensures that the product of the factors equals the original input number `n`.
