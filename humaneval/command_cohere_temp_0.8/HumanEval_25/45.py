```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code uses a simple approach to find the prime factors of an integer `n`. It iterates from `2` up to `n` and for each number checks if it is prime. If it is prime, it is added to the list of factors. Then, the code iterates on the factors and divides `n` by each of the factors until `n` becomes 1. The function follows the decorator "principle" and should be able to work with large integers because it divides n by small integers only. Also, the number of iterations is not big since the biggest number is n.
