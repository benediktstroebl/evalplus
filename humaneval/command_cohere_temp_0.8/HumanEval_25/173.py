        if is_prime:

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given number `n`. It starts by considering integers from 2 up to `n` itself. For each integer `i`, it checks if `i` is prime by iterating from 2 up to the square root of `i`. If no divisors are found, `i` is prime, and it is added to the `factors` list. The algorithm then continues to divide `n` by each found prime factor repeatedly until `n` is reduced to 1. Finally, any remaining prime factors are appended to the `factors` list, ensuring that the final output lists all prime factors and their respective counts. The resulting list of prime factors is returned in ascending order.
