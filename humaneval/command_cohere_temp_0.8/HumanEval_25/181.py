```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for divisor in range(2, n):
        if n % divisor == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % divisor == 0:
                n //= divisor
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(divisor)
                factors.extend([divisor] * count)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an efficient and organized approach to factorization. It initiates this by iterating through potential divisors, beginning from 2 and stopping at the integer itself. As it finds divisors, it recursively divides the number and keeps track of the count using a `count` variable. This allows the code to pinpoint multiple occurrences of the same factor within the number. Subsequently, the code validates the `count` variable, ensuring it is greater than zero before appending the divisor to the `factors` list. This prevents the list from containing zero-count factors. To account for any remaining factors after the division process, the code adds the final value of `n` to the list.
