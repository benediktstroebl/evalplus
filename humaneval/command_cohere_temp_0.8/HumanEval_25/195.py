```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It begins by assuming that `n` is not divisible by any number less than or equal to its current value. This assumption is then repeatedly tested for each integer between 2 and `i`. If the integer is divisible by any other number, it is deemed not prime and the loop is exited. If not, the integer is recorded as a prime factor and the algorithm divide `n` by that factor. The loop continues until all prime factors have been extracted. 

To ensure correctness, the code undergoes three test cases:
1. Assert that the list of factors for the integer 8 is indeed `[2, 2, 2]`.
2. Assert that the list of factors for the integer 25 is `[5, 5]`.
3. Assert that the list of factors for the integer 70 is `[2, 5, 7]`. 

These tests verify the integrity of the code and its adherence to the problem's constraints.
