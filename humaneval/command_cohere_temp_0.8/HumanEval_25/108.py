```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_factor = n % i == 0
        if is_factor and i != n // i:
            factors.append(i)
            while is_factor:
                n //= i
                is_factor = n % i == 0
                if is_factor and i != n // i:
                    factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an optimized factorization algorithm that iterates through integers from 2 up to the input number `n` and identifies prime factors. The algorithm utilizes the property that prime factors are the only factors that can be paired down to a smaller factor during division. The list of factors is collected in the same order as they appear in the factorization and ensures that each factor is included the number of times it contributes to the factorization. The final factor is handled separately to account for cases where `n` remains after factoring. The function executes efficiently by avoiding unnecessary factorization attempts for numbers that have already been excluded as factors.
