```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for divisor in range(2, n):
        if n % divisor == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % divisor == 0:
                n //= divisor
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(divisor)
                factors.extend([divisor] * count)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of an integer `n`. Firstly, it iterates through divisors ranging from 2 up to `n` (excluding `n` itself since it's not a prime number). For each divisor, the code checks if it can divide `n` without leaving a remainder. Upon encountering a divisor that can divide `n`, the code iterates through the divisors recursively, effectively dividing `n` until it becomes 1. The number of iterations corresponds to the count of the divisor's occurrences in the factorization.

Finally, the code constructs a list of prime factors, ensuring that each factor is listed in descending order from largest to smallest. It also includes the count of occurrences for each factor in the final list. This list of factors is then returned.

Here is an example of function call:
```python
factorize(70)
```
The output of this example will be:
```python
[2, 5, 7]
```

This resultant list represents the prime factors of 70, where 2 appears twice, 5 once, and 7 once.
