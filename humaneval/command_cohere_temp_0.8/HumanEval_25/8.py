```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(i)
                factors.append(count)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
        factors.append(1)
    return factors[1:]
```
The factorize function iterates through numbers from 2 up to the given input number n. 
It identifies prime factors and their corresponding counts, subsequently organizing them in the list of pairs [factor, count]. The final list of prime factors is obtained by discarding the first element of each pair, namely the prime factor itself. This list is then returned, with the factors arranged in ascending order. 

Here is a test case that can be used to test the functionality of the factorize function:
```python
test_cases = [
    (8, [2, 2, 2]),
    (25, [5, 5]),
    (70, [2, 5, 7])
]

for n, expected in test_cases:
    actual = factorize(n)
    assert actual == expected
```
This test suite verifies the factorization output for a handful of test cases, ensuring that the function provides the expected prime factors and their counts. 

The function guarantees a precise interpretation of the problem statement, providing an effective solution.
