```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_factor = n % i == 0
        if is_factor:
            factors.append(i)
            while is_factor:
                n //= i
                is_factor = n % i == 0
                if is_factor:
                    factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The factorization is done iteratively by checking successive integers starting from 2. The loop continues until the result is no longer divisible by the current integer, indicating a prime factor. The method keeps track of factors in a list, updating it whenever a new prime factor is found. To account for multiple occurrences of the same prime factor in the factorization, the loop iterates until the input number is fully factorized. The resulting list of prime factors is returned, ensuring proper typing for future type-checking.  This approach provides an efficient and understandable solution to the problem, making it easier to maintain and comprehend the code in the future.
