    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It starts by iterating from 2 up to `n-1` to check each integer as a potential factor. Within the nested loop, it checks if the potential factor is prime by iterating from 2 up to half the potential factor. If the potential factor is divisible by any integer within this range, it is dismissed as prime, and the `is_prime` flag is set to `False`.

If the `is_prime` flag remains `True` after the nested loop, the potential factor is indeed prime. It is then appended to the `factors` list, and the algorithm repeatedly divides `n` by this factor while updating `n` until `n` is no longer divisible by the current prime factor. This process ensures that each prime factor is listed only once in the result, and the number of times it appears corresponds to its occurrence in the factorization. The final outcome is a list of prime factors sorted from smallest to largest, reflecting the count of each factor in the factorization of the original number. 

To address edge cases, the algorithm has been refined. It handles scenarios where `n` is less than 2 or equals 1, ultimately returning an empty list in these cases. Moreover, when `n` equals 2, the function is now designed to yield a list comprising a single 2, thereby accommodating this pivotal prime number.
