```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count = 0
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
                count += 1
            if count > 0:
                factors.append(i)
                factors.append(count)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
        factors.append(1)
    return factors[1:]
```
The factorization algorithm runs through potential factors from 2 up to the input value n, iteratively dividing n by each potential factor. When a factor is found, the algorithm counts how many times it appears in the factorization and includes both the factor and its corresponding count in the solution array. After factoring n, the algorithm verifies if n is greater than 1, ensuring that any remaining factors are added to the solution. The final solution array excludes the prime factor of 1, providing a list of prime factors and their respective counts in descending order.
