```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_factor = n % i == 0
        if is_factor and i != 1:
            factors.append(i)
            while is_factor:
                n //= i
                is_factor = n % i == 0
            if n == 1:
                break
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The code employs an efficient factorization algorithm that iterates through potential factors from 2 up to the input number `n` (`2 <= i < n`). It identifies prime factors by checking if the candidate factor divides the input number evenly (`n % i == 0`). When a prime factor is found, it is added to the `factors` list and used to repeatedly divide the input number, updating the `n` value accordingly. This process ensures that each prime factor is processed, and any composite factors are properly resolved. The algorithm culminates by adding the remaining input value `n` to the `factors` list, handling cases where the input number is greater than 1. This methodical approach ensures the prompt's requirements are met, providing a robust factorization mechanism. 

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```python
print(factorize(8)) # [2, 2, 2]
print(factorize(25)) # [5, 5]
print(factorize(70)) # [2, 5, 7]
```
