    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            factors.append(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i

The code employs an iterative approach to determine the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It starts by iterating from 2 up to the given number `n`. For each number, it checks if it is prime by iterating from 2 up to the candidate factor itself. 

If the candidate factor is prime, it is added to the list of factors. Then, the code iterates through the factors to find all multiples of this prime factor in the given number `n`. It ensures that each factor is listed in the result as many times as it appears in the factorization of the input number. 

Finally, if there are any remaining factors in `n` that are not part of the prime factorization, it is appended to the list of factors. This approach ensures the correct prime factorization is returned for any given integer `n`.
