```python
def double_the_difference(nums):
    odd_sq = sum(n**2 for n in nums if n % 2 and n >= 0 and isinstance(n, int))
    return int(odd_sq)
```

The function `double_the_difference` employs a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `nums`. For each number, it checks if the number is both odd and a valid integer (i.e., not negative and not not an integer). If a number satisfies these conditions, its square is added to the growing sum.

To ensure a valid return value, the sum is converted to an integer using the `int()` function. This is important because the sum of squares can result in a decimal value, but the function wants to return an integer value.

This solution is efficient due to the compressed logic in the list comprehension, which reduces the complexity to O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list.
