```python
def double_the_difference(nums):
    odd_squares = sum(x**2 for x in nums if x % 2 == 1 and x >= 0)
    return int(odd_squares)
```

This function takes a list of numbers, `nums`, as input. It uses a list comprehension to filter out odd integers that are also non-negative from the list. The sum of the squares of these numbers is then calculated. The function returns the sum of these squares, which represents the "difference" referred to in the problem statement. If the input list is empty, it returns 0. 

The tests passed are:
```python
test_double_the_difference_empty_list = ({'nums': []}, 0)
test_double_the_difference_negative_list = ({'nums': [-1, -2, 0]}, 0)
test_double_the_difference_mixed_list = ({'nums': [1, 3, 2, 0]}, 10)
test_double_the_difference_odd_list = ({'nums': [9, -2]}, 81)
```
