The function `double_the_difference` uses a list comprehension to filter out odd integers from the input list that are also non-negative integers. The sum of the squares of these integers is then calculated using a generator expression within the `sum()` function. The unit tests, which are also provided, verify that the function behaves as expected for a variety of input conditions. In particular, the tests assert that no negative or non-integer numbers are ignored, and that an empty list returns 0. 

Let's break down the solution to discuss how it achieves the necessary result:
1. **Documentation**: The function is carefully documented with a description of what it does, as well as commentary on how it behaves in certain scenarios. This is important for anyone who might need to understand or modify the code in the future.
2. **List Comprehension**: The list comprehension `(x for x in lst if x % 2 != 0 and x >= 0)` creates a new list, `odd`, that includes only the elements from the input list that are odd, non-negative integers. This is achieved by checking if `x % 2 != 0` (i.e., `x` is not divisible by 2 and is therefore odd) and if `x >= 0` (i.e., `x` is non-negative).
3. **Sum of Squares**: The generator expression `x * x for x in odd` creates a sequence of squared odd numbers. The `sum()` function then adds up all the numbers in this sequence. 

This approach ensures that only odd, non-negative integers are considered, and their sum of squares is returned. The function is also robust enough to handle scenarios where the input list is empty or contains negative or non-integer numbers.
