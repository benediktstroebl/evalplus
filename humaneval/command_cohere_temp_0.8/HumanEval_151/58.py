```python
def double_the_difference(nums):
    odd_squares = [x**2 for x in nums if x % 2 != 0 and x >= 0]
    return sum(odd_squares) if odd_squares else 0
```

The function `double_the_difference` employs list comprehension to filter out odd integers from the input list that are also non-negative, and then calculates the sum of their squares. The special case of an empty list is handled by the `sum()` function which returns 0 for an empty list. The function returns 0 if no valid integers are found. 

To test this function, you can use the following inputs:
- `[1, 3, 2, 0]`
- `[{-1, -2, 0}`, `0]"`
- `[9, -2]`
- `([0])`

The function is designed to handle these inputs and return the expected values: `10`, `0`, `81`, and `0` respectively.
