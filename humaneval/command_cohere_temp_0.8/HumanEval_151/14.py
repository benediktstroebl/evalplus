```python
def double_the_difference(nums):
    odd_and_positive = [x for x in nums if x > 0 and isinstance(x, int) and x % 2 != 0]
    return sum(x * x for x in odd_and_positive)
```

This function uses a list comprehension to filter out odd, positive, and integer values from the input list. Subsequently, it calculates the sum of the squares of these values using another comprehension. This approach provides a concise solution to the problem.

To check the correctness of the solution, you can use the following test cases:
```python
assert double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 10
assert double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) == 0
assert double_the_difference([9, -2]) == 81
assert double_the_difference([0]) == 0
assert double_the_difference([1, -1, 2, 3, -4, 5, -2]) == 1 + 9 + 4 + 25 = 39
assert double_the_difference([]) == 0
```

These tests cover different scenarios, including edge cases, to ensure the function behaves as expected.
