```python
def double_the_difference(nums):
    odd_squares = sum(num**2 for num in nums if num % 2 and num >= 0 and isinstance(num, int))
    return int(odd_squares)
```

This function employs list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `nums`. For each number, it checks if the number is both odd and positive (i.e., divisible by zero), and a valid integer using the conditions `num % 2` checks for oddness, `num >= 0` checks for non-negative value, and `isinstance(num, int)` checks for integer validity. If these conditions are met, the function calculates the square of the number and adds it to the running total. Finally, it returns the computed sum of squares as an integer.

This solution has been tested with the use of example use cases provided in the original problem and returns the expected outputs.

**NOTE:** Since the sum of squares of odd numbers is always positive, we don't need to explicitly check for the case where the input list is empty, as the sum of squares over an empty list is naturally zero. Hence, the empty list case provided in the problem statement is redundant, as the function already returns zero in such a scenario without the need for explicit handling.
