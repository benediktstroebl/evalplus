Here's a Python function that solves the given problem and includes helpful messages for each step to explain the logic:
```python
def double_the_difference(lst):
    result = 0

    # Filter out non-integer values and negative numbers
    valid_numbers = [num for num in lst if isinstance(num, int) and num >= 0]
    
    # Calculate the squares of valid odd numbers and sum them
    odd_numbers = [num for num in valid_numbers if num % 2 != 0]
    squared_odds = [num ** 2 for num in odd_numbers]
    result += sum(squared_odds)
    
    # Handle empty list case
    if not valid_numbers:
        return 0
    
    return result

# Test Cases
assert double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 10, "Test case 1 failed."
assert double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) == 0, "Test case 2 failed."
assert double_the_difference([9, -2]) == 81, "Test case 3 failed."
assert double_the_difference([0]) == 0, "Test case 4 failed."
assert double_the_difference([1, -1, 2, 3, -4, 5, -2]) == 61, "Test case 5 failed."
```

Here's the breakdown of the code:
1. **Validation Step**:
    - The `valid_numbers` list comprehension filters out numbers that are not integers or negative numbers.
2. **Odd Number & Squaring Step**:
    - The `odd_numbers` list comprehension identifies odd numbers from the `valid_numbers` list.
    - The `squared_odds` list comprehension squares each odd number, preparing them for summation.
3. **Summation Step**:
    - The result is augmented with the sum of the squared odd numbers.
4. **Empty List Handling**:
    - A check ensures that the result is set to 0 if the input list is empty, returning the correct output for an empty list. 

This problem showcases a straightforward yet descriptive approach, ensuring that the code follows a clearly defined path. Feel free to modify the tests or ask for more clarification on any of the steps!
