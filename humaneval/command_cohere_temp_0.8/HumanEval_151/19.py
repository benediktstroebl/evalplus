```python
def double_the_difference(nums):
    odd_and_valid = [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0 and num >= 0 and isinstance(num, int)]
    return sum(num ** 2 for num in odd_and_valid)
```

This function uses a list comprehension to filter valid odd integers from the input list, squares each using a generator expression, and then sums these squared values. The resulting value is returned as the output. The function automatically handles input lists of any size, empty or non-empty, providing a straightforward solution to the problem as outlined in the prompt. 

You can easily test this function with various input lists to observe its behavior. For example:
```python
print(double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]))  # Output: 10
print(double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]))  # Output: 0
print(double_the_difference([9, -2]))  # Output: 81
print(double_the_difference([0]))  # Output: 0
print(double_the_difference([]))  # Output: 0
``` 
The function behaves as designed for each of these test cases, providing the expected output based on the problem statement.
