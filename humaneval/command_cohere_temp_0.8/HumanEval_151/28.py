```python
def double_the_difference(nums):
    odd_and_valid = [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0 and num >= 0 and isinstance(num, int)]
    return sum(num ** 2 for num in odd_and_valid)
```

This function uses a list comprehension to filter valid, odd, and non-negative integers from the input list, squares each filtered integer, and returns the sum of the squares. Empty input returns 0. This aligns with the problem statement in the previous message. Let me know if you'd like to make any adjustments or if you'd like me to explain any part of the code further.
