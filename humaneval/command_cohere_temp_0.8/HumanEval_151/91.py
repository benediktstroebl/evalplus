```python
def double_the_difference(nums):
    odd_and_positive = [x for x in nums if x > 0 and isinstance(x, int) and x % 2 != 0]
    return sum(x * x for x in odd_and_positive)
```

This function uses a list comprehension to filter out odd, positive, and integer values from the input list. Then, it double-squares each value and returns the sum. The result is returned as 0 if the list is empty or if there are no qualifying elements. 

To follow the problem's specifications, the code assumes integers to take values from the set of natural numbers only (excluding negative numbers). 

This solution is straightforward and effective in solving the problem. 

Note: In the event of a list contraction, the function's handling of the empty list could be improved. Currently, an empty list will return 0, contrary to the problem's explanation, which states that the empty list should not yield a value. An improved version could be:
```python
def double_the_difference(nums):
    if not nums:  # Check if the list is empty
        return None 
    odd_and_positive = [x for x in nums if x > 0 and isinstance(x, int) and x % 2 != 0]
    return sum(x * x for x in odd_and_positive)
```

This modified version returns `None` for empty lists, addressing the problem statement's concern. 
However, please note that returning `None` might make the function incompatible with some use cases, so further adjustment could be needed depending on the desired output for empty lists.
