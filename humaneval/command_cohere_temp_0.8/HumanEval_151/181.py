```python
def double_the_difference(lst):
    odd_and_positive = [x for x in lst if x > 0 and isinstance(x, int) and x % 2 != 0]
    return sum(x * x for x in odd_and_positive)
```

This function uses a list comprehension to filter out odd, positive, and integer-valued numbers from the input list. Then, it doubles the 'difference' of these numbers by squaring each value and summing the results. The behavior stipulated in the docstring, such as handling an empty list or ignoring negative numbers, is implicitly assured by the function's logic.
