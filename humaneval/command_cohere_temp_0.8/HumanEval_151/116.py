```python
def double_the_difference(nums):
    odd_squares = [x**2 for x in nums if x % 2 != 0 and x >= 0]
    return sum(odd_squares) if odd_squares else 0
```

The function `double_the_difference` employs list comprehension to filter odd integers and calculate their squares, then returns the sum of those squares. If the input list is empty or lacks odd integers, it returns 0 to avoid raising an error. 

This approach allows the function to handle various scenarios, including returning the sum of odd squares when there's a mix of numbers, handling an empty list, and correctly processing positive and negative odd numbers.
