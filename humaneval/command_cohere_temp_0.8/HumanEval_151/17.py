Here's a Python script that includes a function `double_the_difference` that solves the problem in a self-contained manner, along with concise docstrings that describe the purpose and behavior of the function:
```python
def double_the_difference(lst):
    """
    Given a list of numbers, return the sum of squares of the numbers
    in the list that are odd. Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.
    """
    odd_ints = [num for num in lst if num > 0 and isinstance(num, int) and num % 2 != 0]
    return sum(num ** 2 for num in odd_ints)
```

This function uses a list comprehension to filter out odd integer values from the input list, squares each of them, and returns the sum of the squared values. The result is effectively the "difference" between the squared odd values and the total sum of squares, doubled.

To demonstrate, you can use the following test cases to verify the function's behavior:
```python
assert double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 10
assert double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) == 0
assert double_the_difference([9, -2]) == 81
assert double_the_difference([0]) == 0
assert double_the_difference([1, -1, 2, 3, -4, 5, -6]) == 41
assert double_the_difference([]) == 0
```
