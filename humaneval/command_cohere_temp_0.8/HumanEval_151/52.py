Here's a Python function that solves the given problem and includes informative docstrings to describe its behavior:
```python
def double_the_difference(lst):
    """
    Given a list of numbers, return the sum of squares of the numbers
    in the list that are odd. Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.
    
    If the input list is empty, return 0.
    """
    # Validate the input list
    if not lst:
        return 0
    
    # Filter out odd, non-negative integers from the list
    valid_numbers = [num for num in lst if num % 2 != 0 and num >= 0 and isinstance(num, int)]
    
    # Calculate the sum of squares of valid numbers and return the result
    return sum(num ** 2 for num in valid_numbers)
```

The function incorporates pre-flight checks to ensure the input list is not empty and efficiently filters valid numbers using a list comprehension. It then calculates the sum of squares for these valid numbers. This implementation is both effective and readable due to its clear documentation.
