Here's a Python script that includes a function `double_the_difference` to solve the problem:
```python
def double_the_difference(lst):
    odd_squares = sum(x**2 for x in lst if x % 2 != 0 and x >= 0 and isinstance(x, int))
    return odd_squares if lst else 0

# Test Cases
assert double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 10
assert double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) == 0
assert double_the_difference([9, -2]) == 81
assert double_the_difference([0]) == 0 
assert double_the_difference([1, -1, 1, 1, -1]) == 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 4
assert double_the_difference([]) == 0
```

This function calculates the sum of the squares of odd natural numbers in the list, ignores negative numbers, non-integer values, and empty lists.

Test cases are also provided to validate the function. You can use them to test the function on different input lists.  Each test case checks if the function returns the expected output for a given input list.  The `assert` statements will fail and raise an error if the function provides the wrong result for a specific test case.
