```python
def double_the_difference(lst):
    odd = [x for x in lst if x % 2 != 0 and x >= 0]
    return sum(x * x for x in odd)
```
The function `double_the_difference` uses a list comprehension to filter out odd integers from the input list that are also non-negative (`odd = [x for x in lst if x % 2 != 0 and x >= 0]`). Then, it calculates the sum of squares for this subset using a generator expression in the `sum()` function (`sum(x * x for x in odd)`). The resulting sum of squares for the odd non-negative numbers in the list is then returned. 

This solution allows the function to handle various edge cases, such as an empty list, negative numbers, and integers. 
The following is a test case that can be used to validate the function:
```python
def test_double_the_difference():
    assert double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 10
    assert double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) == 0
    assert double_the_difference([9, -2]) == 81
    assert double_the_difference([0]) == 0
    assert double_the_difference([]) == 0
``` 
To verify the function's behavior, this test case includes a variety of scenarios, such as a standard list of numbers, lists containing negative values, and an empty list. 
To run the test, you can call the function with the test case parameter in the command line:
```python
test_double_the_difference()
``` 
Or, if you have set up a Python test environment, such as pytest or unittest, you can execute the test file that includes the test case. 
This way, you can assure the function returns the expected result.
