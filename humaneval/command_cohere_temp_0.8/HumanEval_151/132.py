```python
def double_the_difference(nums):
    """
    Sum of squares of odd integers in a list of numbers.
    
    Args:
        nums (list): List of numbers
    
    Returns:
        int: Sum of squares of odd integers or 0 if the list is empty or contains only negative integers or non-integer values.
    """
    result = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 0 and isinstance(num, int) and num % 2:
            result += num ** 2
    return result
```

The function employs a simple loop to check for positive odd integers, which is efficient for small list sizes. However, if you're dealing with a large list, consideration of a more optimized approach (e.g., using itertools or generators) or built-in functions like `filter()` might be worthwhile, especially for large lists. 

This solution adheres to the problem's expectations, returning 0 in cases of empty inputs, negative integers, or non-integer values.
