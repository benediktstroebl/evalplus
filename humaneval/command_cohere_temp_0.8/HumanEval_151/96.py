Here's a Python function that solves the given problem and includes informative commentary to clarify its operation:
```python
def double_the_difference(lst):
    """
    Sum of squares of odd numbers in a list, while ignoring negative or non-integer numbers.
    
    Returns:
        int: The sum of squares of odd numbers, or 0 if the list is empty or contains only negative or non-integer numbers.
    """
    # Ensure the list is sorted to make the indexing operation consistent
    lst = sorted(lst)
    
    total = 0  # Initialize the total sum
    
    # Traverse the sorted list
    for num in lst:
        if num % 2 != 0 and num >= 0 and isinstance(num, int):
            total += num ** 2
    
    return total
```

This function, `double_the_difference`, calculates the sum of the squares of odd numbers present in the input list. It filters out numbers that are negative or not integers. To ensure consistent indexing, the input list is first sorted. Then, using a loop, it processes each number in the sorted list, evaluating whether it's odd, non-negative, and an integer. For qualifying numbers, it computes the square and includes it in the total. The function returns 0 if the input list is empty or consists solely of negative numbers or non-integer values.
