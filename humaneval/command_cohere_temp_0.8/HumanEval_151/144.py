```python
def double_the_difference(lst):
    odd = [x for x in lst if x % 2 != 0 and x >= 0]
    return sum(x * x for x in odd)
```
The `double_the_difference` function takes a list of numbers, `lst`, as its argument. It uses a list comprehension to filter out odd integers that are also non-negative (`x % 2 != 0 and x >= 0`) from the input list and assigns this filtered sequence to the variable `odd`. After that, it employs another sum operation with a generator expression to calculate the sum of squares of the odd numbers. The generator expression, `x * x for x in odd`, squares each element in the `odd` list. Finally, the function returns the resulting sum. 

This approach ensures that negative numbers, non-integer values, and empty input lists are correctly handled and that the sum of squares of odd integers is returned.
