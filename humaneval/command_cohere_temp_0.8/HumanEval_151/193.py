```python
def double_the_difference(nums):
    odd_and_valid = [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0 and num >= 0 and isinstance(num, int)]
    return sum(num ** 2 for num in odd_and_valid)
```

This function uses a list comprehension to filter valid odd integers from the input list, squares each using a generator expression, and then sums these squared values. The resulting sum of squares for valid odd integers is then returned.

For clarity, here's a breakdown of the function:
1. **odd_and_valid = [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0 and num >= 0 and isinstance(num, int)]** : This list comprehension filters odd numbers that are also non-negative and integer values from the input list. The conditions num % 2 != 0 checks for oddness, num >= 0 checks for non-negative, and isinstance(num, int) checks if the element is an integer.
2. **return sum(num ** 2 for num in odd_and_valid)** : Now, we focus solely on the filtered odd and valid integers. The sum function adds up their squares using a generator expression (num ** 2 for num in odd_and_valid). The result is the sum of squares for valid odd numbers.

This function returns 0 if the input list is empty, as there would be no valid odd numbers to consider. The function also handles negative or non-integer values without raising errors, simply ignoring them.
