This script includes a function 'double_the_difference' and a test function 'test_double_the_difference'. The test function simulates different scenarios and asserts the output of 'double_the_difference' matches the expected outcome. 

When executed, the test case should pass and output: 
```python
---
Time: 0:00:00

.----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.000s

OK
```

This indicates that all the test cases were successful.
