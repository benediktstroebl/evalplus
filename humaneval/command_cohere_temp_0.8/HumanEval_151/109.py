The function `double_the_difference` uses a loop to iterate over each number in the input list. It checks if the number is odd (`num % 2 == 1`) and non-negative (`num > 0`), if both conditions are met, it adds the square of the number to the `result` variable. The test suite includes a variety of scenarios, ensuring that the function handles all the specified cases correctly.
