```python
def double_the_difference(nums):
    """
    Sum of squares of odd integers in a list of numbers.
    
    Args:
        nums (list): List of numbers
    
    Returns:
        int: Sum of squares of odd integers or 0 if the list is empty or contains only negative numbers or non-integer values.
    """
    result = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num % 2 != 0 and num >= 0 and isinstance(num, int):
            result += num ** 2
    return result
```

The function iterates through each number in the list and checks if the number is odd, non-negative, and an integer. If so, it adds the square of the number to the `result`. The function returns 0 if the input list is empty or contains only negative numbers and non-integer values. 

To test this function, you can use the following code:
```python
test_cases = [
    ([1, 3, 2, 0], 10),
    ([-1, -2, 0], 0),
    ([9, -2], 81),
    ([0], 0),
    ([], 0),
    (['a', 'b', 3, 'c'], 0),
]

for test_case in test_cases:
    nums, expected_result = test_case
    result = double_the_difference(nums)
    assert result == expected_result, f"Expected {expected_result}, but got {result} for input {nums}"
```

The tests cover a variety of scenarios, including empty lists, lists containing only negative or non-integer numbers, and lists containing odd integers, ensuring that the function behaves correctly in each case.  This function is also efficient, as it uses simple iterative logic to process the list and does not require any complex mathematical operations or external functions.
