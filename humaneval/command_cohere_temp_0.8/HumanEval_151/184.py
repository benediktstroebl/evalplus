Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def double_the_difference(lst):
    odd_squares = sum(x**2 for x in lst if x % 2 != 0 and x >= 0 and isinstance(x, int))
    return int(odd_squares)
```
This function calculates the sum of squares of odd numbers from the list, ensures they are integers and not negative, and then casts the result to an integer format. 

Here is an example usage extraction:
```python
print(double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]))  # Output: 10
print(double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]))  # Output: 0
print(double_the_difference([9, -2]))  # Output: 81
print(double_the_difference([0]))  # Output: 0
print(double_the_difference([]))  # Output: 0
```
Which aligns with the previously shared test cases.
