```python
def double_the_difference(nums):
    odd_sq = sum(n**2 for n in nums if n % 2 and n >= 0 and isinstance(n, int))
    return int(odd_sq)
```

This function employs list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `nums`. For each number, it checks if the number is both odd and a valid integer (i.e., not negative and an instance of the int type), in which case, its square is added to the growing sum `odd_sq`. Finally, the function returns the integer value of this sum, as mandated by the problem statement.

To test this function, you can use the following code:
```python
test_lists = [
    [1, 3, 2, 0],
    [-1, -2, 0],
    [9, -2],
    [0],
    [],
    [2, 5, 7, 9],
]

expected_result = [10, 0, 81, 0, 0, 0]

for t in test_lists:
    assert double_the_difference(t) == expected_result[0]
```

This block of code provides a series of lists of different lengths and characteristics that collectively cover the myriad scenarios depicted in the problem statement. Each list's expected output is stored in the `expected_result` list, which is then used to assert equality with the output of the `double_the_difference` function.
