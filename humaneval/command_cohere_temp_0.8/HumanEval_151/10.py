Here's a Python function that solves the given problem and includes descriptive variable names to make the code more legible:
```python
def double_the_difference(numbers):
    odd_squares = 0

    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 != 0 and isinstance(num, int) and num >= 0:
            odd_squares += num ** 2

    return odd_squares

# Test Cases
assert double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 10
assert double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) == 0
assert double_the_difference([9, -2]) == 81
assert double_the_difference([0]) == 0
assert double_the_difference([2, 4, 6, 8]) == 200
assert double_the_difference([]) == 0
```

This version of the code is more readable and maintains the functionality of the provided solution. Feel free to add more test cases and reach out if you have any further questions or if you'd like help with another concept!
