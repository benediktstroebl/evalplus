Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and includes helpful comments and appropriate test cases to verify the functionality:
```python
def double_the_difference(lst):
    """
    Given a list of numbers, return the sum of squares of the numbers
    in the list that are odd. Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.
    """
    result = 0
    for num in lst:
        if isinstance(num, int) and num % 2 != 0 and num >= 0:
            result += num ** 2

    return result

# Test cases
assert double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 10
assert double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) == 0
assert double_the_difference([9, -2]) == 81
assert double_the_difference([0]) == 0
assert double_the_difference([2, 4, 6, 8]) == 50
assert double_the_difference([-2, -4, 6, -8]) == 0

# Edge case: Empty list
empty_list = []
assert double_the_difference(empty_list) == 0
```

This script includes a function `double_the_difference` that calculates the sum of squares of odd integers in the list, ignoring negative numbers and non-integer values. It then verifies the function's behavior using a series of test cases, including edge cases like an empty list.
