```python
def double_the_difference(lst):
    odd = [x for x in lst if x % 2 != 0 and x >= 0 and isinstance(x, int)]
    return sum(x * x for x in odd)
```
```python
test_cases = [
    ([1, 3, 2, 0], 10),
    ([-1, -2, 0], 0),
    ([9, -2], 81),
    ([0], 0),
    ([], 0)
]

for expected, input_ in test_cases:
    assert double_the_difference(input_) == expected
```
The function `double_the_difference` uses a list comprehension to filter out odd integers from the input list that are also non-negative and integer values. After filtering, it calculates the sum of the squares of these odd numbers. The tests further validate the function against different input scenarios to ensure it returns the expected results.
