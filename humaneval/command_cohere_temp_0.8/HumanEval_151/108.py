Here's a Python function that solves the given problem and includes informative tests.

```python
def double_the_difference(nums):
    "Returns the sum of squares of odd integers in nums."
    result = sum(x**2 for x in nums if x % 2 and x > 0 and isinstance(x, int))
    return result

def test_double_the_difference():
    assert double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 10
    assert double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) == 0
    assert double_the_difference([9, -2]) == 81
    assert double_the_difference([0]) == 0
    assert double_the_difference([2, 4, 6, 8]) == 85
    assert double_the_difference([-2, -4, -6, -8]) == 0
    assert double_the_difference([]) == 0

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_double_the_difference()
```

In this script, the `double_the_difference` function is designed to calculate the sum of squares of odd integers in the `nums` list, while ensuring that the integers are not negative and are of int data type. The function returns 0 if the input list is empty.

The test function, `test_double_the_difference`, validates the behavior of the `double_the_difference` function with various input scenarios. It verifies that the function produces the expected outcomes for each distinct case.

When you run this script, the test function will execute, appropriately assessing the behavior of the `double_the_difference` function and providing insight into its expected functionality.
