```python
def fib4(n: int) -> int:
    fib4_cache = [0, 0, 2, 0]
    if n < 5:
        return fib4_cache[n]
    else:
        return fib4_cache[n] = fib4(n - 1) + fib4(n - 2) + fib4(n - 3) + fib4(n - 4)
```

The code defines a function `fib4` that efficiently calculates the n-th element of the Fib4 sequence, an extension of the Fibonacci sequence. The function initially provides values for the first four terms of the sequence (through an iterated assignment using the list `fib4_cache`), thereafter, it leverages memoization to avoid repetition, using the cached values to compute subsequent terms. 

The logic is succinctly encapsulated without recursion, making the function both efficient and non-recursive. The function is also type-aware, as the `n` parameter is declared as an integer, and the function returns an integer value as well. 

This is a concise, elegant solution to the problem, and the inclusion of a cache (or dictionary) allows for efficient look-up and avoids the need for repeated calculations. This approach provides a straightforward solution to compute the Fib4 sequence for any positive integer `n`.  This solution avoids the potential stack-related limitations that recursion might impose and elegantly solves the problem with a concise and performant approach.
