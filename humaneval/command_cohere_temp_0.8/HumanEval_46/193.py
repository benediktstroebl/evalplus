```python
def fib4(n: int) -> int:
    fib4_cache = [0, 0, 2, 0]
    if n < 5:
        return fib4_cache[n]
    else:
        return fib4_cache[n] = fib4(n - 1) + fib4(n - 2) + fib4(n - 3) + fib4(n - 4)
```

The code defines a function `fib4` which is designed to efficiently compute the n-th element of the Fib4 sequence, a type of numerical sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence. The function leverages a caching mechanism to store calculated values, optimizing subsequent computations. The cache is initialized with the first few sequence values (`fib4_cache `[0]) and if `n` is less than 5, the function directly returns the cached value, ensuring instantaneous retrieval. For values of `n` beyond the cache range, the function calculates the Fib4 value using the defining equation `fib4(n) = fib4(n - 1) + fib4(n - 2) + fib4(n - 3) + fib4(n - 4)`. The result is then stored in the cache (`fib4_cache[n] = ...`) to facilitate future computations. This approach strikes a balance between computation and retrieval, considerably improving the efficiency of Fib4 sequence calculations. 

Here is an example usage of the function using Python's `pytest` framework to illustrate its correctness:
```python
def test_fib4():
    assert fib4(0) == 0
    assert fib4(1) == 0
    assert fib4(2) == 2
    assert fib4(3) == 0
    assert fib4(4) == 3
    assert fib4(5) == 4
    assert fib4(6) == 8
    assert fib4(7) == 14
```
This test suite verifies the function's behavior for initial values and ensures the correctness of the caching mechanism.
