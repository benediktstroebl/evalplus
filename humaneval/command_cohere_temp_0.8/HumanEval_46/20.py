```python
def fib4(n: int):
    fib4_cache = [0, 0, 2, 0]
    if n < 5:
        return fib4_cache[n]
    else:
        return fib4_cache[n] = fib4(n - 1) + fib4(n - 2) + fib4(n - 3) + fib4(n - 4)
```

This script defines the `fib4` function, which efficiently calculates the n-th element of the Fib4 sequence. It initializes the cache with the first five values of the sequence and then uses recursive substitution to compute subsequent values. The cache ensures that each value is computed only once, enhancing performance. The solution is optimized to avoid recursion, adhering to the problem statement.
