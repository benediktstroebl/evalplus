```python
def fib4(n: int):
    fib4_cache = [0, 0, 2, 0]
    if n < 5:
        return fib4_cache[n]
    else:
        return fib4_cache[n] = fib4(n - 1) + fib4(n - 2) + fib4(n - 3) + fib4(n - 4)
```

This script defines the `fib4` function, which efficiently calculates the n-th element of the Fib4 sequence. It initializes the cache with the first five sequence elements and uses memoization to store computed values. For n less than 5, it directly returns the cached value. Otherwise, it computes the result using the recursive formula, updating the cache along the way. The script ensures the correctness of the solution and achieves efficient computation of Fib4 values without resorting to recursion.
