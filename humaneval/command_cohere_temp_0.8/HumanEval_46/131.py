# Testing the function
assert fib4(5) == 4, "Fifth element of fib4 sequence is incorrect."

This function implements the Fib4 sequence described in the prompt. It supports negative testing and handles the edge cases of `n` being 0, 1, 2, or 3, where the respective values of the sequence are 0, 0, 2, and 0. It also incorporates a straightforward iterative approach to calculate the `n`-th Fib4 number for any other value of `n` by summing the previous 4 elements in the sequence.
