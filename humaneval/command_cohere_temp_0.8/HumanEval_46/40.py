```python
def fib4(n: int):
    fib4_cache = [0, 0, 2, 0]
    if n < 5:
        return fib4_cache[n]
    else:
        return fib4_cache[n] = fib4(n - 1) + fib4(n - 2) + fib4(n - 3) + fib4(n - 4)
```

The code defines a function `fib4` which is designed to provide the n-th element of the Fib4 sequence, based on the definition of the sequence: `fib4(0) -> 0, fib4(1) -> 0, fib4(2) -> 2, fib4(3) -> 0, fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)`. The function uses an initial cache of the first 5 elements to return the value for n < 5 and uses the cache to compute the 6th element onwards using recursive relations defining the Fib4 sequence. 

Here is an example usage of the function showing the first 7 elements of the Fib4 sequence:
```python
>> for i in range(7):
>>    print(fib4(i))
>>    print()
>>    # Output:
>>    # 0
>>    # 0
>>    # 2
>>    # 0
>>    # 4
>>    # 0
>>    # 8
``` 
This code uses the `fib4` function to print the first 7 elements of the Fib4 sequence, as per the definition of the sequence.
