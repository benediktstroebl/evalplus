```python
def fib4(n):
    a,b,c,d = 0,0,1,1
    for i in range(n):
        a,b,c,d = b,c,d, a+b+c+d
    return a

# Test cases
assert fib4(0) == 0
assert fib4(1) == 0
assert fib4(2) == 2
assert fib4(3) == 0
assert fib4(4) == 3
assert fib4(5) == 4
assert fib4(6) == 8

This solution uses an iterative approach and stores the values of the previous four steps in variables to compute the next value in the sequence. 
It avoids the recursion called for in the challenge, and the solution is deterministic and efficient, completing in  `O(N)` time.  This is because each element is computed in `O(1)` time.  It also has the benefit of not being limited by system stack size, unlike a recursive approach.
