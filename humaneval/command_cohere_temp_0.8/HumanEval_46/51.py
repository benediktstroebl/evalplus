```python
def fib4(n: int) -> int:
    """
    The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequence that's defined as follows:
    fib4(0) -> 0
    fib4(1) -> 0
    fib4(2) -> 2
    fib4(3) -> 0
    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).
    """
    if n < 4:
        return n
    else:
        return fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)
```

This function uses a very simple if-else statement to handle the base cases (n = 0, 1, 2, 3) and then combines the already solved smaller problems to solve the larger one. It thus doesn't reuse any previously calculated values but instead relies on the fact that smaller problems are solved and uses those results to compute the result for the larger problem.

This approach is very efficient from a time complexity standpoint, especially since the bigger computations are all bounded by a loop that only iterates up to `n-4` which is always going to be smaller than `n`. The bound to `n` also ensures that there's no risk of an infinite loop or memory overflow, making the function safe and efficient.
