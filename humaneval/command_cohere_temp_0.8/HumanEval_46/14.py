The code incorporates a loop that iterates through the value of `n` and updates the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` accordingly. The result is then returned upon completion. While this approach does not use recursion, it is somewhat inefficient as it calculates intermediate values multiple times. If efficiency is not a primary concern, the code nonetheless achieves the desired outcome.
