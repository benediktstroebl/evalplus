This script uses an iterative approach to calculate the Fib4 value for n. It initializes the first 4 values of the sequence and uses a loop to calculate the values for subsequent indices. It avoids recursion and builds the sequence incrementally, which makes it efficient for calculating larger values of n. 
```python
# Here is some additional commentary to explain some of the code in greater detail.

# Initializing res to the first 4 values of the sequence
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# Here, we start by creating a list called res and initialize it with the first four values of the Fib4 sequence: fib4(0), fib4(1), fib4(2), and fib4(3). These are the base cases of the sequence.

# Building the sequence up to nth index using a loop
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# Instead of using recursion, which can be inefficient for large n, we use a loop to iteratively calculate the sequence.
# The building of the sequence uses a nested loop structure, where each iteration of the outer loop increases the index by 1 (up to n).
# Within the outer loop, the inner loop iterates over the previous four indices and calculates the sum of the previous four values to generate the next value in the sequence.

# Returning the calculated Fib4 value for n
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# Once the loop is completed, the value of res[n] will hold the calculated Fib4 value for the given input n. We then return this value from the fib4 function.
