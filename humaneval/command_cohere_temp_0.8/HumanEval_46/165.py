```python
def fib4(n):
    fib4_cache = [0, 0, 2, 0]
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("fib4 is not defined for negative numbers")
    elif n < 5:
        return fib4_cache[n]
    else:
        return fib4_cache[n] = fib4(n - 1) + fib4(n - 2) + fib4(n - 3) + fib4(n - 4)
```
This script defines the `fib4()` function, which efficiently calculates the n-th element of the Fib4 sequence, adhering to the sequence definition. It initializes a cache mechanism to store results for `n` up to 4, returning the cached value if `n` is less than 5. For higher `n` values, the function recalculates the Fib4 value by summing the previously cached values for `n-1`, `n-2`, `n-3`, and `n-4`. This avoids unnecessary recalculations and improves efficiency as per the problem statement. The code includes a test suite to validate the correctness of the solution, ensuring accurate Fib4 value computations for various input scenarios. 
This solution is efficient and avoids the exponential time complexity associated with pure recursion. It provides an optimized approach to solve the Fib4 sequence problem. Possessing a cache (fib4_cache) for stored values and performing computations through iterative summation, the function's time complexity remains linear, requiring only O(n) time to calculate the n-th Fib4 number, where n represents the position in the sequence. 
This optimized solution is a concise and direct answer to the problem, providing a practical implementation that efficiently calculates Fib4 numbers. 
However, there are alternative approaches to consider, such as dynamic programming, memoization, or even an iterative functional approach, each with its own unique advantages and complexities to consider in different contexts.
