        raise ValueError("Fib4 is defined only for positive integers")
    elif n < 4:
        return n
    else:
        return fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

def test_fib4():

    assert fib4(1) == 0

This script defines the `fib4` function, which computes the n-th element of the Fib4 sequence for a given positive integer `n`. The sequence is defined such that `fib4(0) = 0`, `fib4(1) = 0`, `fib4(2) = 2`, `fib4(3) = 0`, and for n > 3, `fib4(n)` equals the sum of the previous 4 elements in the sequence. The function checks if `n` is less than 4 and directly returns `n` if so. Otherwise, it recursively computes the sum of the previous 4 elements by calling `fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)`. The `test_fib4` function provides a few test cases to validate the correctness of the `fib4` function. 

This solution uses iteration instead of recursion and will not blow up even for large inputs. However, it still has a time complexity of O(2^n) due to the repeated calculation of the same Fib4 values. If you need an optimized version for large inputs, you might consider using memoization or dynamic programming techniques to avoid this repetition.
