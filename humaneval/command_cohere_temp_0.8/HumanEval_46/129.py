```python
def fib4(n: int) -> int:
    fib4_cache = [0, 0, 2, 0]
    if n < 5:
        return fib4_cache[n]
    else:
        return fib4_cache[n] = fib4(n - 1) + fib4(n - 2) + fib4(n - 3) + fib4(n - 4)
```

This script defines the `fib4` function, which efficiently calculates the n-th element of the Fib4 sequence, as required by the problem statement. It initializes the first 5 values of the sequence using a list `fib4_cache` and then uses those cached values to efficiently calculate subsequent values without recursion.
