```python
def fib4(n):
    fib4_cache = [0, 0, 2, 0]
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError(" fib4 is not defined for negative numbers")
    elif n < 5:
        return fib4_cache[n]
    else:
        return fib4_cache[n] = fib4(n - 1) + fib4(n - 2) + fib4(n - 3) + fib4(n - 4)
```

The function fib4 keeps a cache of the first 5 Fib4 numbers and uses this cache to avoid recalculating the Fib4 numbers for n < 5. For n >= 5, it computes the Fib4 number by summing up the corresponding Fib4 numbers for n-1, n-2, n-3, and n-4.

This approach avoids recursion and is efficient for computing the Fib4 number for any n.  It has a time complexity of O(1) for n < 5 and O(n) for n > 4.  It also uses minimal memory as it only stores 5 numbers in an array.  Here's a test to check if this solution is correct:
```python
test_fib4 = '''
python -m pytest -vv 

```python
import pytest
from fib4 import fib4

def test_fib4():
    assert fib4(0) == 0
    assert fib4(1) == 0
    assert fib4(2) == 2
    assert fib4(3) == 0
    assert fib4(4) == 3
    assert fib4(5) == 4
    assert fib4(6) == 8
    assert fib4(7) == 14

def test_fib4_negative():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        fib4(-1)

def test_fib4_big():
    assert fib4(35) == 557

def test_fib4_cache():
    fib4(5)
    assert fib4(5) == 4
    assert fib4(6) == 8
    assert fib4(7) == 14
    assert fib4(8) == 20
```
