```python
def fib4(n: int) -> int:
    fib4_numbers = [0, 0, 2, 0]
    for i in range(5, n + 1):
        fib4_numbers.append(fib4_numbers[i - 1] + fib4_numbers[i - 2] + fib4_numbers[i - 3] + fib4_numbers[i - 4])
    return fib4_numbers[n]
```

This code defines a Fib4 sequence analogous to the Fibonacci sequence, and the `fib4()` function computes the `n`th element in this sequence efficiently using a loop rather than recursion. The sequence begins `[0, 0, 2, 0]` and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous four. The code tackles the problem by iteratively calculating these sums up to the desired index `n`, and then returning the value at that index. This avoids the exponential complexity associated with recursive solutions to similar problems.
