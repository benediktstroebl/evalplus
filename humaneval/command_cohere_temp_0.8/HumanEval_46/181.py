This script defines the `fib4` function, which is designed to calculate the n-th element of the Fib4 sequence efficiently without resorting to recursion. It covers edge cases such as negative input, base cases, and the odd-indexed values being 0. The sequence is defined through a recursive relationship similar to the Fibonacci sequence. The function uses a loop instead of recursion to compute the result, ensuring efficiency and avoiding potential stack-related issues for large inputs. The provided test cases demonstrate correct behavior for different inputs.  If you have any questions, let's tackle them together!
