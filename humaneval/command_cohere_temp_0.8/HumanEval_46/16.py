```python
def fib4(n):
    a,b,c,d = 0,0,1,1
    for i in range(n):
        a,b,c,d = d,a+b,c+d,a+b+c+d
    return a

# Tests
assert fib4(0) == 0
assert fib4(1) == 0
assert fib4(2) == 2
assert fib4(3) == 0
assert fib4(4) == 3
assert fib4(5) == 4
assert fib4(6) == 8
assert fib4(7) == 14
```
This solution uses an iterative approach to calculate the Fib4 number sequence. The state of the four variables ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd') is updated in each iteration until it reaches the desired index 'n'. The final 'a' value will be the Fib4 value at index 'n'.  This approach avoids the potential stack-related challenges associated with recursive solutions, making it more efficient and scalable, as it doesn't impose extra overhead with function calls or limit the achievable solution size due to stack depth.
