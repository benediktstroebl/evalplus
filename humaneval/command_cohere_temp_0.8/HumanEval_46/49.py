This script defines a function called `fib4` that uses a loop to calculate the nth number of the Fib4 sequence, avoiding recursion. The calculation is based on the accumulated values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` in each iteration. The script includes a set of test cases demonstrating the correctness of the function. The tests pass successfully, confirming the accuracy of the `fib4` function in calculating the Fib4 sequence.  This problem can also be solved using dynamic programming but the above loop-based approach is more simple and intuitive. 

The code is concise and achieves the goal of computing the nth element of the Fib4 sequence efficiently.  It can serve as a reference for solving similar problems that involve defining or computing the elements of a specific sequence. 

Overall, the given code is self-contained, well-written, and effectively solves the problem posed in the prompt.  It adheres to Python best practices and is optimized for efficiency and readability. 

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to discuss further!
