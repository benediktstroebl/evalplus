```python
def fib4(n):
    a,b,c,d = 0,0,1,1
    for i in range(n):
        a,b,c,d = d,a+b,c+d,a+b+c+d
    return a

# Tests
assert fib4(0) == 0
assert fib4(1) == 0
assert fib4(2) == 2
assert fib4(3) == 0
assert fib4(4) == 3
assert fib4(5) == 4
assert fib4(6) == 8
assert fib4(7) == 14
```
This solution uses an iterative approach and stores the values of the previous four steps in variables to calculate the next value in the sequence. This avoids the potential stack-related issues associated with recursive solutions, as per the instructions to avoid recursion.
