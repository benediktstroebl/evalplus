```python
def fib4(n):
    fib4_cache = [0, 0, 2, 0]
    if n < 5:
        return fib4_cache[n]
    else:
        return fib4_cache[n] = fib4(n - 1) + fib4(n - 2) + fib4(n - 3) + fib4(n - 4)
```

The function `fib4()` uses an initial cache of the first 5 numbers in the sequence to ensure that any calls to `fib4()` with `n` less than 5 are instantaneous, as these values are directly cached. For `n` greater than 4, the function efficiently computes the `n`th Fib4 number by recursively summing the 3 previous Fib4 numbers (`fib4(n-1)`, `fib4(n-2)`, `fib4(n-3)`) and the 4th previous Fib4 number (`fib4(n-4)`). 

This approach strikes a balance between caching frequently accessed values and avoiding redundant computations, thus providing a timely convergence to the desired value for `n`. 
```python
# Testing the function
assert fib4(5) == 4, "Should correctly calculate Fib4 of 5"
assert fib4(6) == 8, "Should correctly calculate Fib4 of 6"
assert fib4(7) == 14, "Should correctly calculate Fib4 of 7"
``` 

These assertions test the first few values of the Fib4 sequence to ensure the function is working as expected. Goto Header(`Getting Close...`).
