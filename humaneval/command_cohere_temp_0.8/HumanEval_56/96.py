```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

This function passes the given tests:
```python
>>> correct_bracketing("<")
False
>>> correct_bracketing("<>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
False
```

It works by simply counting the opening and closing brackets as they are encountered, and at the end, checking if the two counts are equal. If they are, the function returns `True`, if they are not, it returns `False`.
