```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

The following test cases are submitted to validate the functionality of the code:
```python
>>> correct_bracketing("<")
False
>>> correct_bracketing("<>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
False
```

This script will return `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the provided string, and `False` otherwise. It also keeps track of the number of open and close brackets and returns false if at any point the number of open brackets exceeds the number of close brackets. It returns true otherwise.
