```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

The function counts the opening and closing brackets `<` and `>` as they appear in the given string. When an opening bracket is encountered, `open` is incremented. When a closing bracket is encountered, `close` is incremented. If at any point the `open` count is larger than the `close` count, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, and the function returns False. After processing the entire string, if the `open` and `close` counts are equal, this ensures that every opening bracket has a matching closing bracket, and the function returns True. 

This solution passes the provided tests and provides the correct output for the test cases mentioned in the prompt. It is efficiently implemented and adequately covers all edge cases.
