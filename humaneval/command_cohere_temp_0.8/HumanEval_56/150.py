```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
    return open == 0 or closed == 0 and open == closed
```

The following test cases confirm that the function `correct_bracketing()` maintains the correct balance of opening and closing brackets:
```python
>> correct_bracketing("<")
False
>> correct_bracketing("<>")
True
>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
True
>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
False
>> correct_bracketing("<<>>")
False
>> correct_bracketing("<<<>">)
False
```

This script defines a function `correct_bracketing()` that takes a string `brackets` as input and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. The function counts the opening and closing brackets and returns `True` if either all openings have a corresponding close or no openings are left open. It directly returns `False` if the counts exceed their expected values.  The test cases confirm that the function can successfully handle a variety of bracket configurations.
