```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

This Python script provides a self-contained function called `correct_bracketing` encapsulated in a code block that solves the problem described, where the function takes a string as input and returns either `True` or `False` depending on whether the opening and closing brackets are balanced or not. It simply keeps track of the number of opening and closing brackets and returns `False` if the count of opening brackets is greater than the count of closing brackets at any point, and returns `True` if they are balanced. It also includes example tests that prove its efficacy.
