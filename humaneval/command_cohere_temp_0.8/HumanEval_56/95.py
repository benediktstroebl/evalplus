```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

This Python script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string `brackets` as input. The function counts the opening and closing brackets within the string using two counters, `open` and `close`, which are initialized to 0. It then iterates through each character in the input string and increments the `open` counter if the character is an opening bracket (`'<'`), and increments the `close` counter if the character is a closing bracket ('>'). Additionally, it checks if the count of opening brackets is greater than the count of closing brackets during iteration; if so, it returns False, indicating that there are more opening brackets than closing brackets, and the balancing is not correct.

After processing all characters, the function checks if the `open` counter and the `close` counter are equal, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. If they are equal, it returns `True`, indicating that the brackets are correctly balanced; if not, it returns `False`. 

This code directly addresses the problem statement and provides a clear and concise solution without needing external dependencies or extra code for testing, making it a self-contained answer to the problem. It also ensures that opening and closing brackets are correctly balanced within the provided string.
