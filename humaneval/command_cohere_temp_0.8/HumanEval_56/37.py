```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

The following test cases are deemed correct by the function:
- `correct_bracketing("<")`: Returns `False`
- `correct_bracketing("<>")`: Returns `True`
- `correct_bracketing("<<><>>")`: Returns `True`
- `correct_bracketing("><<>")`: Returns `False`

The algorithm counts the opening and closing brackets in the given string `brackets` using two counters `open` and `close` initialized to 0. If at any point the opening brackets are more than the closing brackets, the function returns `False`. If the brackets are balanced, the final check returns `True` only if the total count of both brackets is equal.
