```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

The code counts the number of opening and closing brackets separately while iterating through the input string. It compares the count of opening and closing brackets at the end and returns True if they are equal, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. The function returns False otherwise. 

Here is a commented version of the code for better readability:
```python
# The function takes a string as input which contains only the characters < and >
# It initializes two counters, open and close, to zero, which will be used to track the number of opening and closing brackets
# The code iterates through each character in the input string using a for loop
# If the current character is an opening bracket '<', it increments the open counter by 1
# If the current character is a closing bracket '>', it increments the close counter by 1
# After iterating through all characters, the code checks if the value of open is greater than close
# If it is, it means there are more opening brackets than closing brackets, and the function returns False, indicating an unbalanced set of brackets
# If the count of opening and closing brackets is equal, the function returns True, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket
```
