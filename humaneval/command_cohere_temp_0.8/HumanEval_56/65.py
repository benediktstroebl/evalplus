```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open == closed
```

This Python script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string `brackets` as input. The function calculates the count of opening and closing brackets and returns `True` if the count is equal, indicating that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets, and all closing brackets have corresponding opening brackets. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Here is an example of function usage:
```python
print(correct_bracketing("<<>>")) # Output: True
print(correct_bracketing("><>")) # Output: False
``` 

This would output:
```
True
False
```

Such a method is straightforward to implement and requires minimal computational cost, making it an efficient solution. It is a simple and effective method for solving this problem.
