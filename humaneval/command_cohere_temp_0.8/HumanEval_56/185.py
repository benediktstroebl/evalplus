```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

The following test cases pass:
```python
>>> correct_bracketing("<")
False
>>> correct_bracketing("<>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
False
```

The function counts the opening and closing brackets as it iterates through the string and determines whether the count of opening and closing brackets is consistent. If the count is inconsistent, the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True. 
The given test cases help verify the correct operation of the code.
