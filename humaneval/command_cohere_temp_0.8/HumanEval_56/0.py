```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

The function counts the opening and closing brackets `<` and `>` as they appear in the given string `brackets` and returns `True` if the counts are equal. It returns `False` if there are more opening brackets than closing ones. 

Here is an example of code to test the function:
```python
>>> correct_bracketing("<")
False
>>> correct_bracketing("<>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
False
```
This demonstrates that the function works correctly according to the problem statement.
