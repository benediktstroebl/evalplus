```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

The function counts the opening and closing brackets (`<` and `>`) as they encounter them. It returns `False` if the count of openings is ever greater than the count of closings and returns `True` if they are equal, ensuring that every opening has a corresponding closing bracket. 

Here is a usage example:
```python
>>> correct_bracketing("<")
False
>>> correct_bracketing("<>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
False
```
This demonstrates the correctness of the function as it returns the expected outputs based on the given input.
