```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open == closed
```

This Python script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string `brackets` as input. The function counts the number of opening and closing brackets within the string using two counters, `open` and `closed`, which are initialized to 0. It then iterates through each character in the input string, incrementing the `open` counter if it encounters an opening bracket (`<`) and the `closed` counter if it finds a closing bracket ('>'). Additionally, it checks if the count of opening brackets is greater than the count of closing brackets during each iteration and returns `False` immediately if this condition is met, indicating that there are more opening brackets than closing brackets and the brackets are not balanced.

After processing all characters, the function compares the values of the `open` and `closed` counters. If they are equal, it returns `True`, indicating that the opening and closing brackets are balanced; if not, it returns `False`.
