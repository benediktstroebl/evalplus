```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open == closed
```

This Python script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string `brackets` as input. The function calculates the opening and closing brackets count and returns `True` if the opening brackets count is equal to the closing brackets count. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Here is an example of function usage passing a few test cases as specified in the problem:
```python
>>> correct_bracketing("<")
False
>>> correct_bracketing("<>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
False
```
