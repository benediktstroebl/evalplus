```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

The following test cases illustrate correct usage of the function and demonstrate its behavior:
```python
>>> correct_bracketing("<")
False
>>> correct_bracketing("<>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
False
```
This function correctly handles the problem statement by counting the opening and closing brackets and comparing their counts to determine whether the brackets are balanced.
