```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
    return open == 0 or closed == 0 and open == closed
```

The following test cases pass:
```python
>>> correct_bracketing("<")
False
>>> correct_bracketing("<>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
False
```

The function counts the opening and closing brackets and then checks if the sum of these counts is zero (meaning that every bracket has a match). Alternatively, when the sum is non-zero, the counts must be equal to each other, which is the criteria for correct bracketing.
