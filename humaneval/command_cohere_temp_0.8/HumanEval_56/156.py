```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

This Python script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string `brackets` as input. The function counts the opening and closing brackets within the string using two counters, `open` and `close`, initialised to 0. When an opening bracket (`<`) is encountered, `open` is incremented; similarly, when a closing bracket ('>') is encountered, `close` is incremented. The function returns False if the count of opening brackets is greater than or unequal to the count of closing brackets, indicating an unbalanced bracket pair. Otherwise, if the counts are equal, it returns True, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. 

Here is an example usage of the function showing all possible return states:
```python
print(correct_bracketing("<"))
print(correct_bracketing("<>"))
print(correct_bracketing("<<><>>"))
print(correct_bracketing("><<>"))
```

The script provides a simple and efficient way to determine whether a given string of brackets is balanced without introducing any additional dependencies.
