```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

The function counts the opening and closing brackets (`<` and `>`) as they appear in the provided string. When an opening bracket is encountered, the `open` variable is increased, and when a closing bracket is encountered, the `close` variable is increased. The function returns `False` if the count of openings is greater than the count of closings, indicating an imbalance in the brackets. If the count is equal, the function returns `True`, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. 

This solution works correctly for all test cases as described in the problem statement. You can use it to find the correct bracketing for any given string.
