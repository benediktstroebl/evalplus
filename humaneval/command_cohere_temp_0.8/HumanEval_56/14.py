```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open == closed
```

This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string `brackets` as input. It counts the number of opening and closing brackets within the string and returns `True` if the number of opening brackets is equal to the number of closing brackets, indicating that the brackets are correctly balanced. If the count of opening brackets is greater than the count of closing brackets, it returns `False`, indicating that there are more opening brackets than closing brackets, which would constitute an incorrect bracketing. 

To validate the functionality of the code, the script utilizes example scenarios in tuple format, `(brackets, expected_result)`, where `brackets` is a test-case string and `expected_result` is the corresponding result expected from the function. These tests are appended to the script to ensure the correctness of the function's behavior.
