```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

This Python script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string `brackets` as input. The function counts the number of opening and closing brackets within the string using two counters, `open` and `close`, which are initialized to 0. It then iterates through each character in the input string and increments the `open` counter if the character is an opening bracket (`'<'`), and increments the `close` counter if the character is a closing bracket (`'>'`). Additionally, it checks if the count of opening brackets is greater than the count of closing brackets during each iteration, returning `False` immediately if it is, as this indicates an imbalance. 

After processing all characters, the function returns `True` only if the count of opening brackets is equal to the count of closing brackets, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket and the input brackets are correctly balanced. 

The script also includes four example tests that demonstrate the behavior of the function and confirm its correctness. These tests check cases such as unbalanced brackets, single opening or closing brackets, and correctly balanced brackets. 

The function's behavior is summarized in the following cases:
- `correct_bracketing("<")`: Returns `False` since an opening bracket with no closing bracket is not balanced.
- `correct_bracketing("<>")`: Returns `True` since an opening bracket with a corresponding closing bracket is balanced.
- `correct_bracketing("<<><>>")`: Returns `True` as all opening brackets have closing brackets.
- `correct_bracketing("><<>")`: Returns `False` as more closing brackets than opening brackets. 
This last case is exemplified in the following code:
```python
correct_bracketing("><<>")
```

Which produces the following output:
```bash
False
```
