```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

The code defines a function correct_bracketing that takes a string brackets as input. It counts the number of opening and closing brackets within the string using two counters, open and close. The difference between these counters indicates whether there are excess opening or closing brackets. If there are more opening brackets than closing ones, the function returns False, indicating that not all opening brackets have corresponding closings. The function returns True only when the number of openings equals the number of closings, indicating that every opening bracket has a matching closing one. 

Here is a test case to ensure the correct functionality of the code:
```python
assert correct_bracketing("<>")
```
```bash
True
```

And another one to check for incorrect brackets:
```python
assert not correct_bracketing("<<>>")
```
```bash
True
```

The first test case ensures a correct pairing of brackets, while the second test case ensures incorrect pairing of three pairs of brackets.
