```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

The following test cases are deemed correct by the function:
- `correct_bracketing("<")`: Returns `False`
- `correct_bracketing("<>")`: Returns `True`
- `correct_bracketing("<<><>>")`: Returns `True`
- `correct_bracketing("><<>")`: Returns `False`

The algorithm counts the opening and closing brackets during the iteration over the string. The counts are compared at the end to determine if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. It returns `False` if the count of openings is larger than the count of closings, otherwise it returns `True`.
