```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

The following tests are contained within the script to validate the function:
```python
test_cases = [
    ('', False),
    ('<', False),
    ('>', False),
    ('<>', True),
    ('<<>>', True),
    ('<>', False),
    ('<<<>', True),
    ('<<<>', True),
    ('<>>', False),
]

for test_case, expected in test_cases:
    actual = correct_bracketing(test_case)
    assert actual == expected, f'Failed with: {actual}' for _ in range(10)
```

The function checks if the number of opening brackets (`<`) is always less than or equal to the number of closing brackets (">") by maintaining counts in `open` and `close` variables and returning False if the count of opening brackets is greater than the count of closing brackets at any point or any of the test cases fail, it returns True.

If the number of opening brackets ever exceeds the number of closing brackets, the function will return False, as it signifies improper bracketing. 
This function can be used with an input string to check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.  You can use it to validate any string that contains HTML brackets.  It returns True if every opening bracket is closed and False otherwise.  This allows you to ensure the HTML brackets are correct and properly matched.  It also provides an example of how to use the function with a variety of test cases to verify its correctness.  This approach makes it easier to automate the process of checking brackets in various text scenarios.  The function is self-contained and does not rely on external variables or complex dependencies.  It can be used directly to evaluate bracket correctness.
