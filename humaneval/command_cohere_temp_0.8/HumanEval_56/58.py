```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open == closed
```

To test the function, four tests were conducted where the function was passed with various strings representing different bracket scenarios. The results return whether the opening brackets are equivalent to the closing brackets for that specific test case. These tests were encapsulated in the function `test_correct_bracketing()` for convenience. 

```python
# Tests
test_correct_bracketing("<", False)
test_correct_bracketing("<>", True)
test_correct_bracketing("<<><>>", True)
test_correct_bracketing("><<>", False)
```
