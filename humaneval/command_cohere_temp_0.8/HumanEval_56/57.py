```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

The following test cases illustrate correct usage of the function:
```python
>>> correct_bracketing("<")
False
>>> correct_bracketing("<>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
False
```

This function serves as a straightforward solution to check if the opening and closing brackets are properly balanced within the given input string. If the counts of both types of brackets are equal, the function returns True, indicating that every opening bracket has a correspondent closing bracket. If the count of openings is larger, it returns False, suggesting an unclosed opening bracket. This functionality allows you to effortlessly validate bracket pairings in complex code or text.
