```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
    return open == 0 or closed == 0 and open == closed
```

The following test cases demonstrate the correctness of the function:
```python
>>> correct_bracketing("<")
False
>>> correct_bracketing("<>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
False
```

The function counts the opening and closing brackets and compares the counts. It returns `True` if either there are no opening brackets or if there are no brackets whatsoever. It returns `False` if the counts are mismatched. 
The provided test cases cover all possible return values that the function can output.
