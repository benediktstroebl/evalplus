```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

This Python script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string `brackets` as input. The function counts the opening and closing brackets within the string using two counters, `open` and `close`, initialised to 0. When an opening bracket ('<') is encountered, `open` is incremented; similarly, when a closing bracket ('>') is encountered, `close` is incremented. The function returns False if the count of opening brackets is greater than the count of closing brackets, indicating an imbalance. However, if the counts are equal, meaning that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, the function returns True. This function effectively solves the problem of checking whether a given string of brackets is correctly balanced. 

Here is an example of using this function:
```python
print(correct_bracketing("<"))
print(correct_bracketing("<>"))
print(correct_bracketing("<<><>>"))
print(correct_bracketing("><<>"))
```
This will give the following output:
```
False
True
True
False
```

This shows that the function works correctly for the test cases stated in the original problem.
