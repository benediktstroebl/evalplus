```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open == closed
```

To test the function, the script includes the following tests:
```python
assert not correct_bracketing("<<")
assert correct_bracketing("<>")
assert correct_bracketing("<<<>><<")
assert not correct_bracketing("><>")
``` 

The function checks if the number of opening brackets (`<`) is equal to the number of closing brackets (">"). It returns `True` if they are equal; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

The tests verify different scenarios of opening and closing brackets and verify that the function returns the correct result.
