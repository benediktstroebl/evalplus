```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

The following test cases illustrate correct usage of the function:
```python
>>> correct_bracketing("<")
False
>>> correct_bracketing("<>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
False
```

This function serves as a straightforward solution to check whether an opening bracket matches a closing bracket for every opening bracket present in the provided string. It achieves this by tallying the count of both opening and closing brackets amidst a loop traversing the string. Subsequently, it compares the counts of both bracket types. Overall, if the number of openings is equivalent to the number of closings, the function returns `True`, indicating proper bracketing; otherwise, it returns `False`.  This is useful for validating the consistency of bracket pairings in a given string.
