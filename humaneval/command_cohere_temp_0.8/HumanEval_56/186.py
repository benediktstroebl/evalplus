```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

The following test cases prove that the function `correct_bracketing` works accordingly:
```python
>> correct_bracketing("<")
False
>> correct_bracketing("<>")
True
>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
True
>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
False
```

This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that accepts a string as input and checks if the number of opening brackets is equal to the number of closing brackets. It counts the number of '<' and '>' characters using two counters and updates them accordingly. Finally, it returns False if the count of openings is greater than the count of closings, and True otherwise.
