```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open == closed
```

This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of brackets as an input and returns either `True` or `False`, depending on whether all opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket. It counts the opening and closing brackets and compares the counts. The function returns `True` if the counts are equal, and `False` otherwise. 

To verify the functionality, the script also tests the function with various inputs and retrieves the expected results based on the bracket matchings.

For example, given the input `<`, the function will return `False` since there is only one '<' character and no corresponding '>' character. For the input `<>`, the function will return `True` since the opening bracket `<` has a closing counterpart `>`. 

The provided code is self-contained, meaning it does not rely on any external libraries or modules and can be executed independently for testing and verification of the function.
