```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open == closed
```

This Python script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string `brackets` as input. The function counts the opening and closing brackets within the string and then determines whether each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. It returns `True` if the number of openings and closings is balanced and `False` otherwise. 

Here is an example of how to use the script:
```python
print(correct_bracketing("<>"))  # Output: True
print(correct_bracketing("><>"))  # Output: False
```

This script accurately balances the brackets and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
