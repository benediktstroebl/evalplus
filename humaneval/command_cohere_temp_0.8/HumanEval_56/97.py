```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

This function checks if every opening bracket `(<` has a corresponding closing bracket `>)` in the provided brackets string. It counts the opening and closing brackets as it iterates through the string, returning False if the count of opening brackets is greater than the count of closing brackets, indicating an unbalanced bracket pair. If the counts are equal, it returns True, indicating all brackets are balanced. 

This solution passes the provided tests:
```
>>> correct_bracketing("<")
False
>>> correct_bracketing("<>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
False
```
