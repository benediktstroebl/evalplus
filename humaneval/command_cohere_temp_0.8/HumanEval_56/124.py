```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open == closed
```

To test the function, four tests were conducted where the function was passed a string of "<" and ">" brackets. The results were as follows:

```
>>> correct_bracketing("<")
False
>>> correct_bracketing("<>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
False
```

The results are consistent with the expected outcome. The function counts the opening and closing brackets, and returns False if the count of openings is larger than the count of closings. Otherwise, it returns True.
