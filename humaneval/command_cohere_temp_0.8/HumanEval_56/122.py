```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

The following test cases illustrate correct usage of the function and demonstrate its behavior:
```python
>> correct_bracketing("<")
False
>> correct_bracketing("<>")
True
>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
True
>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
False
```

This function serves as a straightforward solution to check whether the opening and closing brackets are balanced. It achieves this by tallying the opening and closing brackets as it iterates over the input string. The function returns False if the count of opening brackets surpasses the count of closing brackets, indicating an imbalance. Conversely, if the counts are equal, it returns True, confirming that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing partner.
