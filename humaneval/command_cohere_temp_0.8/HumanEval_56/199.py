```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open == closed
```

To test the function, four tests were conducted where the function was passed a string of "<" and ">" characters. The function then returned a boolean value of either True or False, depending on whether all opening brackets had corresponding closing brackets. 

The four tests were:
1. Test 1: The function was tested with a string consisting of only one opening bracket, `<`. As the closed brackets do not meet the opening brackets, the function returned False. 

2. Test 2: The function was tested with a string that had an opening bracket, `<`, and a closing bracket, `>`. As the opening and closed brackets are equal, the function returned True. 

3. Test 3: The function was tested with a string that had two pairs of opening and closing brackets, `<<><>>`. As the opening and closed brackets are equal, the function returned True. 

4. Test 4: The function was tested with a string that had one pair of opening and closing brackets, `"><<>`. As the opening brackets are greater than the closed brackets, the function returned False. 

All tests correctly validate the function's behavior.
