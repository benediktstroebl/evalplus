```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open == closed
```

This Python script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string `brackets` as input. The function counts the opening and closing brackets within the string and then determines whether each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. It achieves this by incrementing `open` and `closed` counters whenever it encounters an opening or closing bracket respectively. Then, the function returns `False` if there is any point where the count of open brackets is greater than the count of closed brackets, indicating an imbalance. If the balance is maintained throughout, meaning that the counts are equal, the function returns `True`. 

This solution includes a docstring that describes the problem and illustrates the correct behavior of the function through example tests. These tests validate the function's behavior against various scenarios: correct and incorrect bracket pairings. 

This balanced bracket checking function is a fundamental concept in programming and can be used in various scenarios such as parsing HTML tags or checking the correctness of mathematical expressions.
