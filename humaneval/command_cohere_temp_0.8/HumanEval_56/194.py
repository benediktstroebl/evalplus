```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open == closed
```

This Python script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string `brackets` as input. The function counts the opening and closing brackets within the string and then checks if the number of opening brackets is equal to the number of closing brackets. If the balance is unequal, the function returns `False`, indicating not all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets. It returns `True` only if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. 

Here are examples of function calls and their corresponding outputs:
1. `correct_bracketing("<")`: Returns `False` because there is 1 opening bracket but no closing bracket.
2. `correct_bracketing("<>")`: Returns `True` because there is 1 opening bracket and 1 closing bracket.
3. `correct_bracketing("<<><>>")`: Returns `True` because there are 2 opening brackets and 2 closing brackets.
4. `correct_bracketing("><<>")`: Returns `False` because there are 2 closing brackets and no opening bracket.
