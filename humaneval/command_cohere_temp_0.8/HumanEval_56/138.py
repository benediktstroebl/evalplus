```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

The following test cases are deemed correct by the function:
- `correct_bracketing("<")`: Returns `False`
- `correct_bracketing("<>")`: Returns `True`
- `correct_bracketing("<<><>>")`: Returns `True`
- `correct_bracketing("><<>")`: Returns `False`

The algorithm counts the opening and closing brackets as it iterates through the string. The count of opening brackets should always be equal to or less than the count of closing brackets, otherwise, the function returns `False`. If the counts are equal, it returns `True`.
