```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open == closed
```

This Python script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string `brackets` as input. The function counts the number of opening and closing brackets within the string using two counters, `open` and `closed`, which are initialized to 0. It then iterates through each character in the input string, increasing the `open` counter if it encounters an opening bracket ('<') and increasing the `closed` counter if it encounters a closing bracket ('>'). Additionally, it checks if the count of opening brackets is greater than the count of closing brackets during each iteration and returns `False` immediately if this condition is met, indicating that there are more opening brackets than closing brackets and the brackets are not balanced.

The function finally returns `True` if the count of opening brackets is equal to the count of closing brackets, indicating that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets and the brackets are balanced, and returns `False` otherwise. This functionality is encapsulated in the code snippet: `return open == closed`.

The given example test cases demonstrate the correctness of the function:
- For the input `<`, the function returns `False` as there is only one opening bracket and no closing brackets.
- For the input `<>`, the function returns `True` because there is one opening bracket matched by one closing bracket.
- For the input `<<><>>`, the function returns `True` due to the balanced opening and closing brackets.
- For the input `"><<>`, the function returns `False` because there is one closing bracket without a matching opening bracket.
