```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open == closed
```

This Python script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string `brackets` as input. The function calculates the count of opening and closing brackets and returns `True` if the count of opening brackets is equal to the count of closing brackets, indicating that the brackets are correctly matched. If the count of opening brackets is greater than the count of closing brackets, it returns `False`, indicating that there are more opening brackets than closing brackets, implying an incorrect match. 

This solution ensures that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the given string and provides a clear explanation of how the logic works.  This solution effectively solves the problem and achieves the goal in a single function, making it efficient and straightforward.
