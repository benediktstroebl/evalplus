```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open == closed
```

This Python script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string `brackets` as input. The function counts the number of opening and closing brackets within the string using two counters, `open` and `closed`, initialised to 0. It then iterates through each character in the input string, incrementing the `open` counter if it encounters an opening bracket ('<') and the `closed` counter if it finds a closing bracket ('>'). Additionally, it checks if the total count of opening brackets exceeds the total count of closing brackets; if so, it returns `False` since there are more opening brackets than closing ones, implying an imbalanced set of brackets.

The function returns `True` only when the count of opening brackets is equal to the count of closing brackets, indicating that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing one, making the bracketing correct. 

This logic ensures that the function handles any valid string input and returns true if and only if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. It makes the solution efficient and suitable for large test cases.
