```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

The following test cases are provided to ensure the function behaves as expected:
```python
>>> correct_bracketing("<")
False
>>> correct_bracketing("<>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
False
```

The function counts the opening and closing brackets and compares the counts. The function returns `False` if the count of opening brackets is greater than the count of closing brackets, and `True` otherwise. The markdown code block can be added as a test case to ensure the solution is self-contained in the markdown snippet as requested in this AI prompt.
