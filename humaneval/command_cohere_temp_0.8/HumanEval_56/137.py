```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

The following test cases are deemed correct by the function:
- `"<"`:  **False**
- `"<>"`: **True**
- `"<<><>>"`: **True** 
- `"><<>"`: **False** 

The script guarantees that every opening bracket `<` is matched by a corresponding closing bracket `>`. It achieves this by counting the number of open and closed brackets as it iterates over the input string. The algorithm maintains that the count of open brackets is always either equal to or less than the count of closed brackets. The function returns `False` if the count of open brackets is greater than that of closed brackets at any point, indicating an unbalanced bracket pair. Otherwise, if the counts are equal at the end, it returns `True`, signifying that every opening bracket has a matching closing bracket, making the bracketing correct.
