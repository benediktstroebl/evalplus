```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

The function counts the opening and closing brackets `<` and `>` as they appear in the given string. When an opening bracket is encountered, `open` is incremented, and when a closing bracket is encountered, `close` is incremented. When the function returns `False`, this indicates an imbalance between open and closed brackets, i.e., more opening brackets than closing brackets, and vice versa. 

Here is an example of a markdown code block with some test cases to verify the functionality of the function:
```python
def test_correct_bracketing():
    assert correct_bracketing("<") is False 
    assert correct_bracketing("<>") is True 
    assert correct_bracketing("<<><>>") is True 
    assert correct_bracketing("><<>") is False 
    assert correct_bracketing("<<>>") is False 
    assert correct_bracketing("<<>") is False 
    assert correct_bracketing("<<<><">>") is False 
test_correct_bracketing()
```
This tests various scenarios, including balances and imbalances of brackets, to ensure that the function `correct_bracketing` returns the appropriate values.
