```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

This Python script provides a self-contained function named `correct_bracketing` encapsulated in a code snippet. The function takes a single argument, `brackets`, which is a string containing characters "<" and ">" and returns a boolean value that indicates whether the opening and closing brackets are balanced. 

To achieve this, the function maintains counters for open and close brackets, incrementsing the appropriate counter whenever a "<" or ">" character is encountered. Then, the function compares the counts of open and closed brackets, returning False if the count of open brackets is greater than the count of closed brackets, indicating an imbalance. If the counts are equal, it returns True, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. 

The code includes a docstring with detailed information about the problem and some test cases that precede the function, all written in Markdown format, and is followed by three example tests enclosed in a code block. The example tests demonstrate various scenarios of invoking the function with different input values to validate its functionality and ensure that it passes all of the tests.
