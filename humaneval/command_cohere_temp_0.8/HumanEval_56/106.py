```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open == closed
```

To test the function, the script includes the following examples:
```python
assert correct_bracketing("<") is False
assert correct_bracketing("<>") is True
assert correct_bracketing("<<><>>") is True
assert correct_bracketing("><<>") is False
``` 

This code defines a function `correct_bracketing`, where it analyzes the input string `brackets` consisting of only the `<` and `>` characters. It counts the opening and closing brackets using two counters, `open` and `closed`. The function then compares the counts of these counters with each other and with the length of the input string to determine if the brackets are correctly balanced, returning `True` if they are and `False` otherwise.
