```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open == closed
```

This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string `brackets` as input. It counts the number of opening and closing brackets within the string and returns `True` if the number of opening and closing brackets is balanced. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

The function leverages basic string manipulation and counting mechanisms to determine the balance of opening and closing brackets, adhering to the problem statement. It returns the result based on the disparity between the counts of opening and closing brackets.
