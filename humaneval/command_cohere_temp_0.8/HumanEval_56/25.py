```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

The code counts the opening and closing brackets `<` and `>` as it iterates through the input string. It keeps track of the imbalances by checking if the count of openings exceeds the count of closings. The function returns false if there is any imbalance, and true if there is none, verifying that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. 

Here is a test case that can be used to validate the functionality of the code:
```python
test_cases = [
    ("<", False),
    ("<>", True),
    ("<<><>", True),
    ("><<>", False)
]

for brackets, expected in test_cases:
    assert correct_bracketing(brackets) == expected
```
