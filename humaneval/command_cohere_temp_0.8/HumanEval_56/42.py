```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

This Python script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string `brackets` as input. The function counts the opening and closing brackets within the string using two counters, `open` and `close`, which are initialized to 0. It then iterates through each character in the input string and increments the `open` counter if the character is an opening bracket (`'<'`), and increments the `close` counter if the character is a closing bracket ('>'). 

The function returns False if the count of opening brackets is greater than the count of closing brackets, indicating an imbalance. It returns True if the counts are equal, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

The script includes example tests that demonstrate the function's behavior for different input strings, reflecting the given markdown code block specifications.
