```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

The following tests are designed to ensure that the function `correct_bracketing` behaves as expected:
```python
# test correct behavior
test_cases = [
    ('', False),
    ('<', False),
    ('>', False),
    ('<>', True),
    ('<<>>', True),
    ('<>', False),
    ('<<<>', True),
    ('<<<>><<>>', True),
]

for brackets in test_cases:
    assert correct_bracketing(brackets) == test_cases[brackets]
```

This test suite covers a range of scenarios, including cases with an empty string, unbalanced brackets, and properly balanced brackets.
