```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open == closed
```

This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string `brackets` as input. It counts the number of opening and closing brackets within the string and returns `True` if the number of opening and closing brackets is balanced. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

The function leverages two variables, `open` and `closed`, to keep track of the count of opening and closing brackets respectively. It iterates through each character in the string and increments the appropriate counter based on whether the character is an opening or closing bracket. 

If at any point the count of opening brackets exceeds the count of closing brackets, the function returns `False` as there is an imbalance. 

Finally, if the function has iterated through all characters and the counts are equal, it returns `True`, indicating a balanced set of brackets. 

This function encapsulates the logic needed to determine whether a given string of brackets is balanced, and its result can be used to form conclusions about the bracket alignment within the provided string.
