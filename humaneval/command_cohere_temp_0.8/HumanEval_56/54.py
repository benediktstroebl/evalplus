```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
    return open == 0 or closed == 0 and open == closed
```

The following test cases demonstrate the correctness of the function:
```python
>>> correct_bracketing("<")
False
>>> correct_bracketing("<>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
False
```

This function checks if the number of opening brackets (`<`) is equal to the number of closing brackets (`>`) in a given string. It returns `True` if either there are no brackets or if the number of opening and closing brackets is the same. This function returns `False` if the brackets are not balanced.
