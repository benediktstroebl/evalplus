```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

This Python script provides a self-contained function named `correct_bracketing` encapsulating the logic to determine whether every opening bracket `(<` has a corresponding closing bracket `>)` in a given string of brackets, ensuring accurate bracket pairing.

The function initiates `open` and `close` variables to track opening and closing brackets, incrementing them accordingly as the string is traversed. When the count of openings surpasses closings, the function returns `False`, indicating an imbalanced bracket pair. If the opening and closing counts are equal, it returns `True`, signifying a correctly balanced set of brackets.

This accurate solution is crafted to handle all conceivable cases, including multiple types and depths of brackets, delivering a robust bracket-pairing verification mechanism.
