```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open == closed
```

This function counts the opening and closing brackets and compares the counts. It returns `False` if the count of opening brackets is larger than the count of closing brackets at any point in the string, and returns `True` if they are equal. It correctly identifies the ending bracket `''>` as valid and returns `True`.
