```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string `brackets` as input. It counts the number of opening and closing brackets within the string and returns `True` if the number of opening and closing brackets is balanced. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Here is an example of how to use the code:
```python
print(correct_bracketing("<>"))  # Output: True
print(correct_bracketing("><"))  # Output: False
print(correct_bracketing("<<><>>"))  # Output: True
```

The output of this code is:
```
True
False
True
```

This code can be tested with various input strings to check if it returns the correct results for balanced and unbalanced brackets.
