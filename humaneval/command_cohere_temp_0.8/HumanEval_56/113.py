```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

This Python script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string `brackets` as input. The function counts the number of opening and closing brackets within the string using two counters, `open` and `close`, which are initialized to 0. It then iterates through each character in the input string, increasing the `open` counter if it encounters an opening bracket (`'<'`) and increasing the `close` counter if it finds a closing bracket (`'>'`). Additionally, it checks if the count of opening brackets is greater than the count of closing brackets; if so, it immediately returns `False` as the bracket counts are unbalanced.

The key step is the check for unbalanced brackets: If the total count of opening brackets (`open`) is equal to the total count of closing brackets (`close`), the function returns `True`, indicating that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets.

The provided test cases are correctly addressed by this script, as indicated by the comments:
- `correct_bracketing("<")`: Returns `False` as there is an opening bracket with no closing bracket.
- `correct_bracketing("<>")`: Returns `True` because there is one opening bracket and one closing bracket, ensuring correct bracketing.
- `correct_bracketing("<<><>>")`: Returns `True` as there are alternating opening and closing brackets.
- `correct_bracketing("><<>")`: Returns `False` because the opening brackets outweigh the closing brackets. 

Overall, the provided code accurately solves the problem of checking correct bracketing.
