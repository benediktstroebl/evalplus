```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open == closed
```

This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string `brackets` as input. It counts the number of opening and closing brackets within the string and returns `True` if the number of opening and closing brackets is balanced. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

The function leverages two variables, `open` and `closed`, to keep track of the count of opening and closing brackets respectively. It then iterates through each character in the string `brackets`, incrementing the `open` counter for each opening bracket `<` and the `closed` counter for every closing bracket `>`. 

If at any point the count of opening brackets exceeds the count of closing brackets, the function returns `False`, indicating an unbalanced set of brackets. 

The function returns `True` only when the final count of opening brackets aligns with the count of closing brackets, assuring that the brackets are properly balanced. 

This solution is encapsulated and does not rely on any external variables or auxiliary functions, making it self-contained. 

To verify the functionality of the code, you can call this function with different test cases (as demonstrated in the problem statement) to ensure that it returns the expected results for each scenario.
