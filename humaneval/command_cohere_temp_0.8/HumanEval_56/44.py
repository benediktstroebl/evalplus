```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open == closed
```

This function counts the opening and closing brackets as it iterates through the string and compares the difference of these counts. It returns false if the opening brackets are greater than the closing brackets at any point or if the counts are unequal at the end. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(correct_bracketing("<"))  # Outputs False
print(correct_bracketing("<>"))  # Outputs True
print(correct_bracketing("<<><>>"))  # Outputs True
print(correct_bracketing("><<>"))  # Outputs False
```
This should output:
```
False
True
True
False
```
The function can also be tested with more robust test cases using a testing framework like pytest.
