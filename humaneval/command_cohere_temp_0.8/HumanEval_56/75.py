```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string `brackets` as input. It counts the number of opening and closing brackets within the string using two counters. The function then compares the counts of opening and closing brackets. If the count of opening brackets is greater than the count of closing brackets, the function returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`. 

Here is an example of function usage:
```python
print(correct_bracketing("<"))
print(correct_bracketing("<>"))
print(correct_bracketing("<<><>>"))
print(correct_bracketing("><<>"))
```

This will output:
```bash
False
True
True
False
```

This function fulfills the problem statement's requirements, correctly determining whether each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket within the provided string.
