```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

The following tests are implemented to ensure the correctness of the function:
```python
def test_correct_bracketing():
    # True cases
    assert correct_bracketing("<>")
    assert correct_bracketing("<<>>")
    assert correct_bracketing("<<<>>>")

    # False cases
    assert not correct_bracketing("<")
    assert not correct_bracketing(">")
    assert not correct_bracketing("<<<>"))
    assert not correct_bracketing("<<>")
    assert not correct_bracketing("><>")
```
To test the function, multiple test cases are included, with each test case representing a specific scenario. The function is called with the input brackets, and the result is compared to the expected output based on the criteria of opening and closing brackets. 

To validate the correctness of the function, the tests can be executed using the `pytest` library. When running the tests, the script outputs detailed information about each test, including the name of the test case and the expected result. If the test passes, it indicates that the function works correctly. Conversely, if there is a discrepancy between the actual and expected results, it indicates a failure, which may require troubleshooting and bug fixing.  By executing these tests, we can confirm the validity of the `correct_bracketing` function implementation.
