```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open == closed
```

To test the function, the script includes the following tests:
```python
>>> correct_bracketing("<")
False
>>> correct_bracketing("<>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
False
```

The function counts the opening and closing brackets sequentially as it traverses the input string. If at any point the count of open brackets exceeds that of closed brackets, the function returns False, indicating an unbalanced bracket pair. If the counts are equal at the end, the function returns True, ensuring that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. 

The provided tests validate the function's behavior against different input scenarios.
