```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

This Python script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string `brackets` as input. The function counts the opening and closing brackets separately as it iterates through the string. It tracks the count of opening brackets (`open`) and closing brackets (`close`) as it traverses the input string.

The function returns `True` if the number of opening brackets is equal to the number of closing brackets, indicating that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This solution is encapsulated, and the logic is straightforward to understand. It also adheres to Python's style principles for clean and readable code. Additionally, the function's interface is user-friendly, accepting a string as input, and providing a clear boolean output.
