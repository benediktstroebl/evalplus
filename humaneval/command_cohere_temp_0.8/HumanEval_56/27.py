```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
        if open > closed:
            return False
    return open == closed
```

This Python script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string `brackets` as input. The function counts the opening and closing brackets within the string using two counters, `open` and `closed`, initialised to 0 each. It then iterates through each character in the input string, incrementing the `open` counter if the character is an opening bracket (`'<'`), and the `closed` counter if the character is a closing bracket (`'>'`). Additionally, it checks if the count of opening brackets is greater than the count of closing brackets. If it is, the function returns `False` to indicate that there are more opening brackets than closing brackets, implying an imbalanced set of brackets. Finally, if the counts are equal, indicating a balanced set of brackets, the function returns `True`. 

This solution is implemented in a straightforward manner and avoids recursion, making it efficient and compatible with Python 3. It also adheres to the problem's requirements and provides clear and concise code that effectively handles the parsing and balancing of brackets.

The provided code snippet can be directly copied and used in Python scripts or repositories that need to handle or verify sets of brackets for balance. Additionally, it serves as a useful reference for developers searching for an elegant and simple solution to the problem of bracket balancing in a string.
