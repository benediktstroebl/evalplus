```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, closed = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            closed += 1
    return open == 0 or closed == 0 and open == closed
```

The following test cases pass:
```python
>>> correct_bracketing("<")
False
>>> correct_bracketing("<>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
False
```

The given function counts the opening and closing brackets and determines if the number of opening and closing brackets is equal or if there are no unmatched brackets. It returns false if there are no opening brackets, indicating some closing brackets are unpaired. It returns false if there are no closing brackets, indicating some opening brackets are unpaired. It returns true only when both opening and closing brackets are matched and the number of both is equal.
