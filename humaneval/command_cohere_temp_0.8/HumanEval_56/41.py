```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

This Python script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string `brackets` as input. The function counts the number of opening and closing brackets within the string using two counters, `open` and `close`, which are initialized to 0. It then iterates through each character in the input string, incrementing the `open` counter if the character is an opening bracket (`'<'`) and the `close` counter if the character is a closing bracket (`'>'`). Additionally, it checks if the count of opening brackets is greater than the count of closing brackets during each iteration to ensure that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets. The function returns `False` if the count of opening brackets is ever larger than the count of closing brackets, indicating an imbalance. It returns `True` only when the count of opening brackets is equal to the count of closing brackets, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and the input string is correctly bracketed. 

Here is an example of a usage of this function:
```python
print(correct_bracketing("<<<>"))  # Output: True
print(correct_bracketing("><<>"))  # Output: False
```

This will return True for the first case and False for the second one respectively.
