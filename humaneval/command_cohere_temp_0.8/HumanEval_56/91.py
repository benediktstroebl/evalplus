```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open, close = 0, 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            open += 1
        elif char == '>':
            close += 1
        if open > close:
            return False
    return open == close
```

This Python script provides a self-contained function called `correct_bracketing` encapsulated in a code snippet. The function takes a single argument, `brackets`, which is a string containing characters '<' and '>'. It aims to determine whether the given string of brackets is balanced, meaning that every opening bracket '<' has a corresponding closing bracket '>'. 

To achieve this, the function counts the number of opening and closing brackets as it iterates through the input string. If the count of opening brackets is ever greater than the count of closing brackets, the function returns `False`, indicating that the brackets are not balanced. Otherwise, if the counts are equal, it returns `True`, indicating that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets. 

This code snippet encapsulates the solution to the problem in a self-contained fashion, allowing users to import and use the `correct_bracketing` function directly for their specific needs. 

This function can be used as a standalone snippet in other Python scripts or modules to validate the balance of brackets in a given string. Furthermore, you can modify the function to better suit specific use cases or integrate it into larger applications as needed.
