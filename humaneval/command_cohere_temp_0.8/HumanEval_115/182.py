Here's a Python script that includes a function max_fill which solves the problem you've described, following the exemplary test scenarios:
```python
import math

def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    """
    Use buckets to empty the wells.
    """
    rows = len(grid)
    if rows == 0:
        return 0

    cols = len(grid[0])
    if cols == 0:
        return 0

    max_fill = float('-inf')

    def fill_row(row, capacity):
        bucket_falls = 0
        for col in range(cols):
            if row[col] > 0:
                bucket_falls += math.ceil(row[col] / capacity)
                row[col] = 0
        return bucket_falls

    for row in grid:
        current_fill = fill_row(row, capacity)
        if current_fill > max_fill:
            max_fill = current_fill

    return max_fill
```
This approach uses a nested iteration to try out each row's filling first, calculating the number of bucket falls needed for that row, and seeing which row requires the most falls to empty it. This optimal approach gives a time complexity of O(N*C), where N is the number of rows and C is the number of columns, which is acceptable given the constraints.
