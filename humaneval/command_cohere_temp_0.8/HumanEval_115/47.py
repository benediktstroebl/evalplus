```python
import math

def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    wells = len(grid[0])
    rows = len(grid)

    filled_rows = sum(sum(row) for row in grid)
    max_fills = filled_rows + (rows - filled_rows) // math.ceil(capacity / wells)

    return max_fills
```

The function `max_fill()` calculates the total number of units of water collected in the filled rows and the maximum number of units that can be collected in the empty rows. It then adds these two quantities together, rounded up if necessary, to account for the maximum number of fills needed to collect all the water. The `examples` section demonstrates how to use this function to solve the given problem.
