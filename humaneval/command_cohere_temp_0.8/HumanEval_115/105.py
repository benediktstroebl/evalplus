Here's a Python script that solves the problem using a self-contained function, which extracts water from wells as efficiently as possible:
```python
import math

def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    """
    Uses buckets to empty wells efficiently.
    """
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    if not rows * cols or not capacity:
        return 0

    # Combine rows to form a 2D matrix
    water = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            water[i][j] = grid[i][j]

    # Fill algorithm
    fills = 0
    buckets = 0
    for i in range(rows):
        prev_buckets = buckets
        for j in range(cols - capacity + 1):
            cur_buckets = math.ceil(water[i][j:j+capacity] / capacity)
            buckets += cur_buckets - prev_buckets
            fills = max(fills, buckets)

        water[i] = [min(water[i][j], capacity) for j in range(cols)]

    return fills
```
This script takes a 2D array (`grid`) that represents the well contents and a capacity as input. It returns the maximum number of times you need to lower the bucket to empty the wells.

Here's how the algorithm works:
1. Combine the grid rows to form a 2D matrix called `water`.
2. Iterate through the rows of the `water` matrix. For each row:
   - Iterate through columns in chunks of `capacity`.
   - Calculate the number of buckets needed for this chunk.
   - Update the fills count with the maximum of the current buckets and previous_buckets.
3. After the loop, `water[i]` contains the minimal water amount in each column of each row.
4. The function returns the fills count, which represents the maximum number of times you need to lower the bucket to empty the wells.

Note: The algorithm assumes that all wells have the same length and the contents of each well are represented by a single row in the input grid. Make sure to adjust the code according to the exact size and format of the input grid provided for a given scenario.
