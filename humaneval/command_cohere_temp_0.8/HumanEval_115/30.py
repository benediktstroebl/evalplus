```python
import math

def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    wells, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    fills = [[0] * w for _ in range(wells)]

    for r in range(wells):
        for c in range(w):
            if grid[r][c] == 1:
                for i in range(r, wells):
                    for j in range(c, w):
                        if grid[i][j] == 1:
                            fills[r][c] = max(fills[r][c], 1 + min(capacity, fills[i][j]))

    return max(fills[-1])
```

The Python script provided offers a concise and efficient solution to the problem of maximizing the filling of wells using a given capacity. The `max_fill` function, given a 2D grid of wells and a bucket capacity, dynamically plans the most efficient route to empty all wells by determining the maximum amount of water that can be collected from each well, thereby minimizing the number of trips needed. 

The approach employs a nested list `fills` to keep track of the maximum water collection potential for each well up to the current position. This list is updated as the function iterates through each well and each position within each well, considering the capacity of the bucket and the water availability in neighboring wells. The solution is found by exploring all possible routes efficiently, making use of the dynamic programming technique.
