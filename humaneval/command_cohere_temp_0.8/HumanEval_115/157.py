```python
import math

def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    wells = len(grid[0])
    rows = len(grid)

    filled_wells = 0
    max_filled = 0

    for row in grid:
        filled_wells += sum(row)

        curr_filled = math.ceil(filled_wells / capacity)
        max_filled = max(max_filled, curr_filled)

    return max_filled
```

The approach uses a simple dynamic programming approach. 
For each row in the grid, the function calculates how many filled wells there are and then calculates how many buckets are needed to empty those wells. The maximum number of buckets needed across all rows gives the answer to the function. 

This solution should work for the specified test cases, which include grids of various sizes and different capacities for the buckets. If the test cases change, the code can be updated accordingly. 
Let me know if you'd like me to explain any part of the solution or provide further clarifications.
