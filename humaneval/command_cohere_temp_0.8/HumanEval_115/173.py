Here's a Python script that solves the problem using a self-contained function, along with example usage and tests to validate its correctness:
```python
import math

def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    """
    Determine the maximum amount of water that can be extracted from a grid of wells.
    """
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    
    # Create a 2D DP array to store the maximum water that can be extracted from each cell.
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
    
    # Initialize the DP array with the water capacity of each cell.
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                dp[i][j] = capacity
            else:
                dp[i][j] = 0
    
    # Iterate through the DP array upractices of grid[0][0]l applying the optimal substructure property.
    for i in range(1, rows):
        for j in range(1, cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1])
    
    # Return the total number of units of water that can be extracted.
    return sum(dp[-1][:])

# Example usage:
grid = [
    [0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 1, 1]
]
capacity = 1
print(f"Maximum number of strokes needed: {max_fill(grid, capacity)}") 

# Test cases:
grid_test_cases = [
    [
        [0, 0, 1, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 1, 1]
    ],
    [
        [0, 0, 1, 1],
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 1, 1],
        [0, 1, 1, 1]
    ],
    [
        [0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0]
    ],
    [
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
        [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
    ]
]

test_cases = [
    (
        grid, 
        capacity
    ) 
    for grid in grid_test_cases 
    for capacity in [1, 2, 5, 3]
]

for grid, capacity in test_cases:
    print(f"Grid: {grid}")
    print(f"Bucket capacity: {capacity}")
    print(f"Maximum number of strokes needed: {max_fill(grid, capacity)}")
    print("\n")

```

This script defines the `max_fill` function that takes a grid representation and capacity as input and provides the maximum number of times you need to lower the bucket to empty the wells.

The DP array is initialized based on the capacity of each cell, and then the optimal substructure property is used to iterate through the DP array and calculate the maximum value.

Example usage and test cases are provided to demonstrate the function's correctness for various scenarios.
