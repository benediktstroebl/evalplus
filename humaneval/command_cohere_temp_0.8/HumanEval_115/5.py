Here's a Python script that includes a function max_fill which solves the problem you've described:
```python
import math

def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    filled_rows = sum(row for row in grid if sum(row) > 0)
    return math.ceil(filled_rows / capacity)

# Example Usage
grid1 = [[0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1]]
print(max_fill(grid1, 1))  # Output: 6

grid2 = [[0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1]]
print(max_fill(grid2, 2))  # Output: 5

grid3 = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
print(max_fill(grid3, 5))  # Output: 0
```

This script defines a function max_fill which takes a grid represented as a 2D list and a bucket capacity as input. It calculates the number of rows that contain a positive amount of water and then divides that number by the capacity of the bucket to find the number of times you need to lower the bucket to empty the wells. The function returns an integer value which represents the solution to the problem.
