Here's a Python script that includes a function max_fill which solves the problem statement from the given Markdown code block:
```python
import math

def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    filled_rows = sum(row for row in grid if sum(row) > 0)
    return math.ceil(filled_rows / capacity)

# Example Usage
grid1 = [[0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1]]
print(max_fill(grid1, 1))  # Output: 6

grid2 = [[0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1]]
print(max_fill(grid2, 2))  # Output: 5

grid3 = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
print(max_fill(grid3, 5))  # Output: 0
```
This script includes the `max_fill` function that takes a grid represented as a list of lists where each element represents a well and a capacity. It calculates the number of rows that have a non-zero capacity and returns the maximum number of times we need to lower the bucket to empty the wells. The function utilizes a sum function to calculate the total number of filled rows and uses the `math.ceil()` function to calculate the maximum number of bucket fillings. The example usage section demonstrates the function using three different grids, each with different specifications, and prints the output for each scenario.
