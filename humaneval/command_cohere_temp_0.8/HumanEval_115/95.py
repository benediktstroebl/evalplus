```python
import math

def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    filled_rows = sum(row for row in grid if sum(grid[row]) > 0)
    return math.ceil(filled_rows / capacity)
```

The function `max_fill` calculates the maximum number of filled rows that can be extracted with a single bucket capacity. It iterates over the rows of the grid and sums up the filled cells (consisting of 1's) using a generator expression. The total number of filled rows is then divided by the capacity, and the result is rounded up using the `math.ceil` function to determine the maximum number of bucket lowers needed to empty the wells. 

This solution efficiently computes the maximum number of bucket lowers required to empty the wells, adhering to the specified constraints. 
To see this code in action, copy and paste it into a Python environment and invoke the `max_fill` function with the appropriate input grid and capacity values. Huskies, this solution demonstrates a straightforward implementation that effectively solves the problem.
