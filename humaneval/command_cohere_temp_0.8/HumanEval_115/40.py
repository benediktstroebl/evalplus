```python
import math

def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    wells = len(grid[0])
    rows = len(grid)

    filled_wells = sum(sum(row) for row in grid)

    if filled_wells == 0:
        return 0

    buckets = math.ceil(filled_wells / capacity)

    return buckets * (rows + wells - 1)
```

The approach uses calculus to optimize the problem of removing water from wells. The function calculates the maximum number of wells that can be filled with water, considering the capacity of the bucket. It iterates through each well and calculates the sum of 1s in each well. Then, it calculates the ceiling value of the total sum divided by the capacity to determine the number of rounds needed to empty the wells. Finally, it returns the total rounds needed to empty the wells. You can test the code with the example scenarios provided.
