```python
import math

def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    wells, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0]) 
    filled_wells = sum(sum(row) for row in grid)
    if filled_wells <= capacity:
        return max_fills = 0
    max_fills = math.ceil(filled_wells / capacity)
    
    count = max_fills * cols
    remaining_wells = max_fills * (wells - 1) + filled_wells - count 
    return max_fills + max(0, math.ceil(remaining_wells / capacity))
```

The approach uses a simple formula to calculate the maximum number of fills required to empty the wells. 

It first calculates the number of filled wells and then calculates the maximum number of wells that can be emptied in one go (assuming all wells are filled). It then calculates the number of rows in those emptied wells, and uses this along with the number of emptied wells to calculate the number of fills required. The approach then checks if there are any remaining wells after emptying max_fills wells, and if so, it calculates an additional max_fills value that accounts for the remaining wells. The final answer is the sum of these two values.
