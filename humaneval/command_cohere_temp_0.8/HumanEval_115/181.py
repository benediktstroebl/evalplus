Here's a Python script that solves the problem using a nested `for` loop and the `numpy` library for efficient linear algebra operations:
```python
import numpy as np

def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    # Create a numpy array from the grid
    well_array = np.array(grid)
    
    # Calculate the total water in each well
    total_water = np.sum(well_array, axis=1)
    
    # Calculate the maximum water that can be held in a single bucket
    max_water = np.max(total_water)
    
    # Calculate the number of trips needed to empty all wells
    trips = np.ceil(total_water / max_water)
    
    return trips.sum()
```

The function takes the input grid and capacity as parameters. It first converts the input grid into a numpy array for efficient operations. It calculates the total units of water in each well by summing the values along the columns. It then finds the maximum capacity of water that can be held in a single bucket, ensuring the maximum number of trips required to empty all wells.

The `numpy` array allows using built-in functions like `np.sum` and `np.max` for these calculations. Finally, it calculates the number of trips required, considers the capacity of each bucket, and returns the overall trips needed using `np.ceil`.
