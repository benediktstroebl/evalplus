```python
import math

def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    wells = len(grid)
    buckets = len(grid[0])

    filled_buckets = 0

    for row in grid:
        col_filled_buckets = sum(row)
        filled_buckets += math.ceil(col_filled_buckets / capacity)

    return filled_backs + (buckets - wells)  # Add extra buckets for rows
```

The function calculates the total number of filled buckets from the grid and then deduces the total number of buckets required to achieve this, finally accounting for the excess buckets required to complete the task. The maximum number of filled buckets to achieve this is the optimal solution.
