```python
import math

def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    wells = len(grid[0])
    rows = len(grid)

    filled_wells = 0

    for i in range(rows):
        row = grid[i]
        for j in range(wells):
            if row[j] == 1:
                filled_wells += 1
                if filled_wells == capacity:
                    return filled_wells
    
    return filled_wells
```
The `max_fill` function assesses the filled wells in a grid and returns the maximum number of filled wells that can be found within the grid given a fixed bucket capacity. It iterates through the rows and columns of the grid, counting the number of filled wells and comparing this count to the bucket capacity. When the count equals the capacity, it returns that count, indicating the maximum number of filled wells that can be emptied within a single bucket capacity.
