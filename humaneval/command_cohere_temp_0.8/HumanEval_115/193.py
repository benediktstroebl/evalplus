    You are given a rectangular grid of wells. Each row represents a single well,
    and each 1 in a row represents a single unit of water.
    Each well has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from it, 
    and all buckets have the same capacity.
    Your task is to use the buckets to empty the wells.
    Output the number of times you need to lower the buckets.

    Example 1:
        Input: 
            grid : [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]]
            bucket_capacity : 1
        Output: 6

    Example 2:
        Input: 
            grid : [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]]
            bucket_capacity : 2
        Output: 5
    
    Example 3:
        Input: 
            grid : [[0,0,0], [0,0,0]]
            bucket_capacity : 5
        Output: 0

    Constraints:
        * all wells have the same length
        * 1 <= grid.length <= 10^2
        * 1 <= grid[:,1].length <= 10^2
        * grid[i][j] -> 0 | 1
        * 1 <= capacity <= 10

This Python script defines a function called `max_fill` that solves the specified problem. It takes in two parameters, a grid of wells and the capacity of the buckets. The script then calculates the maximum amount of water that can be extracted from the wells without overflowing the buckets. 

The script then conducts a one-dimensional pass on the grid to calculate the total water collected and calculates the minimum number of trips needed to empty the wells. It returns the number of trips needed to lower the bucket to empty the wells. In the example provided, the output will be `6`, as the maximum fill of the wells is 6, and hence, the bucket needs to be lowered 6 times.
