```python
import math

def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    filled_rows = sum(sum(row) for row in grid)
    max_fill_count = math.ceil(filled_rows / capacity)
    return max_fill_count
```

The function `max_fill()` calculates the number of rows that can be filled completely with the given `capacity`. It uses mathematics to calculate the number of rows filled with water. Then it uses the ceil function to calculate the minimum number of times we need to lower the bucket to empty the filled rows completely. Finally, the function returns the number of times the bucket needs to be lowered to empty the wells. 

This approach guarantees that the problem is solved in the smallest number of bucket fillings.
