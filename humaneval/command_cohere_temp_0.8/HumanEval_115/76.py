Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
import math

def max_fill(grid, capacity) :
    filled_rows = sum(sum(row) for row in grid)
    max_fill_count = math.ceil(filled_rows / capacity)
    
    return max_fill_count
```
The function `max_fill()` calculates the number of rows that can be filled completely with the given `capacity`. It uses math's `ceil()` to round up the number of rows that can be filled completely. Afterward, it returns the maximum number of times you need to lower the bucket to empty the well.
