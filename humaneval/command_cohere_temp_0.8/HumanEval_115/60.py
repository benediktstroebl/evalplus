```python
import math

def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    filled_rows = sum(row for row in grid if sum(row) > 0)
    return math.ceil(filled_rows / capacity)
```

The `sum` function is used to calculate the total number of filled rows, and the `math.ceil` function assists in determining the maximum number of trips required to empty the wells. The `filled_rows` variable holds the total number of rows that contain at least one filled unit of water. Finally, the `return` statement computes and returns the number of trips required to empty the wells, considering the given capacity. 

This problem can be efficiently solved by using dynamic programming, but the logic required to solve this problem is not necessarily a commonly applied DP framework. If you'd like to better understand dynamic programming or any other algorithmic technique, feel free to inquire further!
