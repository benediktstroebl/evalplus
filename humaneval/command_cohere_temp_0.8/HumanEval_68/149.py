Here's a Python script that includes a self-contained function designed to pluck a node from a tree branch represented by an array, following the given problem guidelines:
```python
def pluck(arr):
    even_nodes = [i for i in arr if i % 2 == 0]
    if not even_nodes:
        return []
    min_even_node = min(even_nodes)
    min_index = even_nodes.index(min_even_node)
    return [min_even_node, min_index]
```

This script includes a standalone `pluck` function that accepts an array (`arr`) representing a tree branch. The function identifies even nodes, nominates the smallest even node, and determines its index. If there are no even nodes, it returns `[]`. 

Here's an example of how you might use this function:
```python
arr = [4, 2, 3]
result = pluck(arr)
print(result)
```

The output will be:
```
[2, 1]
```

This exemplifies the function's behavior when the provided array represents a tree branch. The function plucks the node with the smallest even value and returns it along with its index.
