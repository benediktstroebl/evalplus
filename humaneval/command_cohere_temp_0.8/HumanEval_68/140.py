Here's a Python script that includes a self-contained function designed to pluck a node from a tree branch represented by an array, in accordance with the problem statement:
```python
def pluck(arr):
    even_nodes = [idx for idx, val in enumerate(arr) if val % 2 == 0]
    if even_nodes:
        min_idx = min(even_nodes)
        return [arr[min_idx], min_idx]
    else:
        return []
```

This function identifies even nodes in the array through a list comprehension and determines the index of the smallest even node through the `min` function. The result is a list containing the smallest even value along with its corresponding index.

The code is self-contained within the `pluck` function, meaning it doesn't rely on external variables or functions. It can be directly executed independently, making it reusable and easy to maintain.
