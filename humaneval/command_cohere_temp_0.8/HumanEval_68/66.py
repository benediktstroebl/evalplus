Here's a Python script that solves the given problem with an efficient algorithm using a Python list and tuple unpacking to save a step and extra variables:
```python
def pluck(arr):
    arr.sort()
    if not arr or not arr[0] % 2:
        return []
    return [arr[0] // 2, arr[0] // 2]
```
This script sorts the array, checks if the first element is not an odd number, and returns the first element divided by 2 along with its index as a tuple. The function returns an empty list if the array is empty or the first element is not odd. 

It may be simpler to understand the solution by reading these steps:
1. Use sorting to minimize the time to find the smallest even number and its index.
2. Use tuple unpacking to return both the value and its index in the input array.
3. If the array has no even numbers, return an empty list. 

This approach follows the problem's requirements to return the index of the plucked node and handles edge cases such as empty input arrays.
