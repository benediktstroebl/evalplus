Here's a Python script that solves the given problem with an efficient algorithm using a Python list and list comprehension with a divide and conquer approach:
```python
def pluck(arr):
    even, odd = partition_by_parity(arr)
    if not even:
        return []
    return min_element_by_index(even)

def partition_by_parity(arr):
    # Split array into even and odd values
    return (arr[i:i+2] for i in range(0, len(arr), 2)), arr[1::2]

def min_element_by_index(arr):
    # Return the minimum even value and its index
    return [min(arr), min(range(len(arr)), key=lambda i: arr[i])]
```

This approach uses list comprehension to split the input array into two arrays: one containing even values and the other containing odd values, using a stride of 2. After that, the function `min_element_by_index` minimizes the even values and their index using the `min` function and a custom key function to select the smallest index.

Note: this approach has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of elements in the input array.
