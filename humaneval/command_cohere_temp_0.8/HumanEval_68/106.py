Here's a Python script that solves the given problem with an efficient approach using `itertools.accumulate` and `collections.Counter` to achieve the task:
```python
from collections import Counter
from itertools import accumulate

def pluck(arr):
    even_values = [val for val in accumulate(arr) if val % 2 == 0]
    if not even_values:
        return []
    min_value, min_index = min(Counter(even_values).items()), even_values.index(min(even_values))
    return [min_value, min_index]
```

This approach uses the `accumulate` function to iterate through the input `array` and filter even values using a list comprehension. Subsequently, the `Counter` class is employed to determine the occurrence count for each even value. The `min` function is used to find the smallest even value along with its index. 

The function can efficiently handle various scenarios and return the plucked node in the format [smallest even value, index of the node with the smallest even value].
