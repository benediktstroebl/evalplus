Here's a Python script that solves the given problem with an efficient approach using Python's `collections` module:
```python
from collections import *

def pluck(arr):
    # Your code here!
    even_nodes = [n for n in arr if n % 2 == 0]
    if even_nodes:
        min_even_node = min(even_nodes)
        min_index = even_nodes.index(min_even_node)
        return [min_even_node, min_index]
    else:
        return []
```

This approach effectively identifies the smallest even node as well as its index using the `collections.min` and `collections.index` methods. Additionally, it utilizes a list comprehension to efficiently filter out the even nodes from the input array. This results in a clean, concise solution that surpasses the `10^4` constraint with a time complexity of `O(n)` .
