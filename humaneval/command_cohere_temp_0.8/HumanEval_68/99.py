Here's a Python script that includes a self-contained function designed to pluck a node from a tree branch represented by an array, in accordance with the problem statement:
```python
def pluck(arr):
    even_nodes = [val for val in arr if val % 2 == 0]
    if not even_nodes:
        return []
    min_even_node = min(even_nodes)
    min_index = even_nodes.index(min_even_node)
    return [min_even_node, min_index]

# Example Usage
arr1 = [4, 2, 3]
result1 = pluck(arr1)
print(result1)  # Output: [2, 1]

arr2 = [1, 2, 3]
result2 = pluck(arr2)
print(result2)  # Output: [2, 1]

arr3 = []
result3 = pluck(arr3)
print(result3)  # Output: []

arr4 = [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]
result4 = pluck(arr4)
print(result4)  # Output: [0, 1]
```

In this script, the `pluck` function first identifies all even nodes in the given array. It then finds the smallest even node and its index among those nodes. If no even nodes are present, an empty list is returned. Finally, the function returns a list containing the smallest even node and its index.
