Here's a Python script that solves the given problem with an efficient algorithm using a `dict` for tracking and indexing nodes:
```python
def pluck(arr):
    """
    Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes,
    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.

    The plucked node should have the smallest even value, and in case of a tie, it should be the node 
    with the smallest index. The plucked node should be returned in a list [smallest_value, its index].
    If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].

    Example:
    Input: [4,2,3]
    Output: [2, 1]

    Constraints:
    * 1 <= nodes.length <= 10000
    * 0 <= node.value
    """
    # Initialize a dictionary to track and index nodes with the same value
    node_tracker = {} 
    for i, value in enumerate(arr):
        if value % 2 == 0: 
            if value not in node_tracker: 
                node_tracker[value] = []
            node_tracker[value].append(i)  
    # If there are no even values, return an empty list
    if not node_tracker: 
        return []
    # If there's only one node with the smallest even value, return it
    if len(node_tracker) == 1: 
        return [min(node_tracker.keys()), min(node_tracker.values())[0]]
    # If there's more than one node with the smallest even value, sort them by index and pick the first
    smallest_value = min(node_tracker.keys())
    smallest_indices = node_tracker[smallest_value]
    return [smallest_value, smallest_indices[0]]
``` 

This approach takes advantage of a dictionary's functionality to track and index nodes with the same value, making the solution effective in terms of time and space complexity. It also doesn't require any additional libraries.
