Here's a Python script that solves the given problem with an efficient approach using Python's `collections` module:
```python
def pluck(arr):
    if not arr:
        return []

    # Use a default value of 2 for index to handle negative values or values greater than array length
    indices = collections.Counter(arr)
    min_index = min(indices.values())

    # Filter only even values and get the minimum value
    filtered = [val for val in arr if val % 2 == 0]
    min_even = min(filtered) if filtered else 2

    return [min_even, min_index] if min_even in filtered else []

# Example usage
input_1 = [4, 2, 3]
print(pluck(input_1))  # Expected output: [2, 1]

input_2 = [1, 2, 3]
print(pluck(input_2))  # Expected output: [2, 1]

input_3 = []
print(pluck(input_3))  # Expected output: []

input_4 = [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]
print(pluck(input_4))  # Expected output: [0, 1]
```

The function leverages the `collections.Counter` class to efficiently tally the occurrences of each value in the array and thereby determine the index of the smallest even value. 

We initialize `min_index` to the minimum value of all index values in the `Counter` object. If there are no even values, we return an empty list, and if there is only one value, we return it with its index.

However, if there are multiple smallest even values, we filter them and their indices and return the pair of the minimum even value and the minimum index. The approach handles the case of negative values or values greater than the array length, using a default index value of `2`.
