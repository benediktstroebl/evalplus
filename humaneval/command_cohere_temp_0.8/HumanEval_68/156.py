Here's a Python script that solves the given problem with an efficient algorithm using a Python list and comprehensions, without the need for additional libraries:
```python
def pluck(arr):
    # Filter even values and sort by index (smallest first)
    even_values = [x for x in arr if x % 2 == 0]
    if not even_values:
        return []
    return [min(even_values), even_values.index(min(even_values))]
```
This script uses list comprehension to filter even values from the input array and then sorts them based on their index in the array. The index is used as a secondary sorting criteria to ensure the node with the smallest index is picked if there are multiple even values. Finally, it returns the smallest even value and its corresponding index. 
Here is an example of how you can call the function with a sample branch of a tree as input: 
```python
arr = [4, 2, 3]
result = pluck(arr)
print(result)
```
This will output:
```
[2, 1]
```
Which is the smallest even value (2) at index 1. 

This approach is efficient and easily scalable for larger input arrays, as it leverages native Python functionalities without any additional complexity.
