Here's a Python script that solves the given problem with an efficient algorithm using a Python list and a nested list:
```python
def pluck(arr):
    # Define a nested list to hold smallest even values and their indices
    result = []
    arr_len = len(arr)
    nested = [[abs(n-2), i] for i, n in enumerate(arr) if n >= 2]
    # If the nested list is empty, return an empty list
    if not nested:
        return []
    # Sort the nested list by values (even nodes) and then by indices (smallest index first)
    nested.sort(key=lambda x: [x[0], x[1]])
    # Fetch the node with the smallest index value
    return [nested[0][0], nested[0][1]]
```

The function `pluck` takes an input array and returns a list containing the smallest even value in the array and its index in the array. The function initially constructs a nested list where each element is a pair containing the absolute value of the difference between the node value and 2 (to determine even nodes), and its index (`[abs(n-2), i]` for each element `n` and its index `i`). If no even values are found, the nested list will be empty, and the function will return an empty list. After constructing the nested list, it is sorted by node values and then by node indices, ensuring that the node with the smallest even value and the smallest index is at index 0 of the list. The function returns a list containing the node value and its index. The code is concise and efficient in solving the problem.
