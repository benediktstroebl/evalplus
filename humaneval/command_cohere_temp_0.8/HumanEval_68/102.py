Here's a Python script that solves the given problem with an efficient approach using python 3.8+ features:
```python
def pluck(arr):
    even_nodes = [x for x in arr if x % 2 == 0]
    return [min(even_nodes), even_nodes.index(min(even_nodes))] if even_nodes else []
```
The provided Python script solves the problem by first filtering out all the even nodes from the input array using a list comprehension. Then, it finds the index of the smallest even node using the `index` method. If there are no even nodes in the array, the function returns an empty list. The output is a list containing the smallest even node and its index, or an empty list if no even nodes are present. 

This approach provides a concise solution and takes advantage of Python's powerful list comprehension and indexing capabilities.
