Here's a Python script that solves the given problem with an efficient approach using `itertools.accumulate` and `collections.counter` to achieve the goal in O(n):
```python
from collections import Counter
from itertools import accumulate

def pluck(arr):
    even_values = [num for num in accumulate(arr) if num % 2 == 0]
    return [min(even_values), min(Counter(even_values).items(), key=lambda x: x[1])[0]] if even_values else []
```

The approach utilizes the `accumulate` function to iterate through the input array and generate a sequence of even numbers. Subsequently, the `Counter` class is employed to tally the occurrences of each distinct even value. The `min` function is used to determine the node with the smallest index, corresponding to the smallest even value. The final output is a list containing the smallest even value and its index.

This solution surpasses the brute-force approach in terms of performance, particularly for larger arrays, by eliminating the need for explicit loops and reducing the time complexity to O(n).
