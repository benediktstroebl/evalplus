Here's a Python script that solves the given problem with an efficient approach using `collections`:
```python
from collections import *

def pluck(arr):
    # Your code here!
    even, index = min(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, arr), key=lambda x: arr.index(x))
    return [even, index] if even else []
```
The code efficiently identifies the smallest even value in the array and returns its index using the `collections.min` function and a `filter` clause to identify the smallest even value. The resulting min value is then returned in a list `[even, index]`. This approach eliminates the need for explicit loops, making the code more concise and efficient for large datasets.
