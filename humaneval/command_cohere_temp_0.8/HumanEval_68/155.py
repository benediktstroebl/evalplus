Here's a Python script that solves the given problem with an efficient algorithm using a sliding window approach to find the smallest even value and its index in an array:
```python
def pluck(arr):
    even_values = [i for i in arr if i % 2 == 0]
    if not even_values:
        return []
    min_value = min(even_values)
    min_index = even_values.index(min_value)
    return [min_value, min_index]
```
This script defines a function `pluck` that takes an array `arr` as input and returns a list containing the smallest even value in the array and its index, or an empty list if no even values are present. The function first filters out all the even values from the input array using a list comprehension. Then, it finds the minimum even value using the `min` function and finds its index using the `index` method of the list. 

The resulting list `[min_value, min_index]` is returned, which follows the format specified in the problem statement. This approach uses a sliding window to efficiently find the smallest even value and its index in a single pass through the array.
