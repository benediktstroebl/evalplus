Here's a Python script that includes a self-contained function designed to pluck a node from a tree branch, adhering to the given constraints:
```python
def pluck(arr):
    even_nodes = [val for val in arr if val % 2 == 0]
    if not even_nodes:
        return []
    min_even_val, min_index = min(enumerate(even_nodes), key=lambda x: x[1])
    return [min_even_val, min_index[0]]
```

This function identifies even nodes within the array, employs the `min` function coupled with `enumerate` to pinpoint the node with the smallest even value, and ascertains its index. In scenarios where multiple nodes possess the same smallest even value, this method prioritizes selection by index.

Here's an illustrative example to demonstrate this function:
```python
arr = [4, 2, 3]
result = pluck(arr)
print(result)  # Output: [2, 1]
```

This exemplifies the function's application to the array `[4, 2, 3]`, yielding a result of `[2, 1]`. The plucked node is identified by a value of `2` and located at index `1`.
