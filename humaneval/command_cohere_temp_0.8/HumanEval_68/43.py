Here's a Python script that includes a self-contained function designed to pluck a node from a tree branch represented by an array, in accordance with the problem statement:
```python
def pluck(arr):
    even_nodes = [i for i in arr if i % 2 == 0]
    if not even_nodes:
        return []
    min_even_node = min(even_nodes)
    min_index = even_nodes.index(min_even_node)
    return [min_even_node, min_index]
```

This function identifies even nodes using a list comprehension and finds the index of the smallest even node using the `min` and `index` methods. The results are returned as a list in the format [smallest even value, index of the smallest even node].

Here's an example of how you can use the `pluck` function:
```python
arr = [4, 2, 3]
result = pluck(arr)
print(result)
```

For the given example, the output will be:
```
[2, 1]
```

This exemplifies the function's behavior, successfully plucking the node with the smallest even value (2) and displaying its index (1) within the array.
