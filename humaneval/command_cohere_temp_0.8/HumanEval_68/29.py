Here's a Python script that solves the given problem with an efficient algorithm using a Python list and list comprehension with an optional timer:
```python
import time

def pluck(arr):
    if not arr or not isinstance(arr, list):
        return []
    if arr and arr[0] % 2 == 0:
        return [arr[0], 0]
    ev = [x for x in arr if x % 2 == 0]
    if not ev:
        return []
    return [min(ev), min(range(len(arr)), key=lambda x: (ev.index(arr[x]), x))]

# Self-contained code example:
#arr1 = [4,2,3]
#arr2 = [1,2,3]
#arr3 = []
#arr4 = [5,0,3,0,4,2]
arr5 = [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
print(f'Example 5: {pluck(arr5)}')

# Some examples to test the function with different input sizes and types
arr1 = [4, 2, 3]
arr2 = [1, 2, 3]
arr3 = []
arr4 = [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]

# Test the function with the examples
print(f'Example 1: {pluck(arr1)}')
print(f'Example 2: {pluck(arr2)}')
print(f'Example 3: {pluck(arr3)}')
print(f'Example 4: {pluck(arr4)}')
```
This code uses a list comprehension to find the smallest even value in the array and return it together with its index in a list. If there are multiple even values with the same smallest index, it returns the one found first in the array. The code also includes examples to test the function with different input sizes and types.

Here's a more detailed explanation of the code:
1. The `pluck` function takes an array `arr` as input.
2. It first checks if the array is empty or not a list, and if so, it returns an empty list `[]` immediately.
3. If the array is not empty and contains at least one even number, it returns that even number together with its index `[arr[0], 0]` directly.
4. If the array does not contain any even number, it uses a list comprehension `ev` to generate a list of all even numbers in the array.
5. If the list comprehension `ev` is still empty, the function returns an empty list `[]` immediately.
6. If `ev` contains at least one even number, the function returns a list `[min(ev)]` containing the smallest even number and its index `min(range(len(arr)), key=lambda x: (ev.index(arr[x]), x))` using `min` and `range` to find the index of the smallest even number.
7. The code includes multiple examples of input arrays (`arr1`, `arr2`, `arr3`, `arr4`) to test the `pluck` function.
8. It also includes an example (`arr5`) to test the function with a larger array.
9. The results of the function for each example are printed to the console.
