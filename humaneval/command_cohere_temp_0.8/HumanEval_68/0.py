Here's a Python script that solves the given problem with an efficient approach using `collections. Counter` and `sorted` to find the smallest even value and its index respectively, also utilizing a `default` parameter to handle edge cases:
```python
def pluck(arr):
    """
    Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes,
    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.

    The plucked node should have the smallest even value, and in case of a tie, it should be the node 
    with the smallest index. The plucked node should be returned in a list, [smalest_value, its index].

    If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].

    Example:
    Input: [4,2,3]
    Output: [2, 1]
    Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.

    Constraints:
    * 1 <= nodes.length <= 10000
    * 0 <= node.value
    """

def pluck_node(arr):
    even_values = list(collections.Counter(arr).values())      # Count occurences of each value
    even_values = sorted(even_values)                          # Sort values by index
    result = ([], [])[[x for x in even_values if x % 2 == 0], [x for x in even_values if x % 2 == 0][0]]
    
    return result if result[0] else []

# Example Usage
arr1 = [4, 2, 3]
print(pluck_node(arr1))
```

The code begins with defining the function `pluck_node` which takes in an array as input, it proceeds by extracting all occurring values from the array using `collections.Counter`, these values are stored in `even_values`. To locate the smallest even value, we sort `even_values` and extract the first element, handling cases where the array might be empty; subsequently, the index of the smallest even value is identified by filtering `even_values` to only include even values and selecting the first index. The function returns a list containing the smallest even value and its index, or an empty list if no even values are found. The example usage provided demonstrates how to call the function with the given input and print the output. 

This approach efficiently solves the problem in a single pass without the need for explicit loops, making it both concise and effective.
