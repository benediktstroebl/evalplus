```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    numbers.sort()
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("At least two numbers must be provided")
    return numbers[0], numbers[-1]
```

Here is a brief explanation of how the code works:
1. The function `find_closest_elements` takes a list of float numbers as input.
2. The `typing` module introduces explicit type annotations to the function, specifying that the input list should be of type `List[float]` and the return value of type `Tuple[float, float]`.
3. The function sorts the input list of numbers in ascending order.
4. The function checks if the length of the sorted list is less than 2, and if so, raises a `ValueError` with the message "At least two numbers must be provided".
5. If the list length is at least 2, the function returns the first and last numbers of the sorted list, which by definition are the two numbers closest to each other.

This approach ensures that the function handles invalid inputs by checking the input list length and sorting the numbers. It also has the advantage of having a relatively low time complexity of `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the length of the input list, as sorting a list in Python tends to be efficient due to its built-in sorting algorithms.
