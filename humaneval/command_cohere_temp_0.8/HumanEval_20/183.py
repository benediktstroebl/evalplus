```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    nums_copy = list(numbers)
    nums_copy.sort()
    return nums_copy[0], nums_copy[-1]
```

This Python script defines a function called `find_closest_elements`, which takes a list of floating numbers as input and returns a tuple containing two elements from the list that are closest to each other. Here's how it works:
1. The function `find_closest_elements` is defined, with a type hint indicating that it accepts a list of float values (`List[float])` as input and returns a tuple of two float values (`Tuple[float, float]`).
2. The function starts by creating a copy of the input list (`nums_copy = list(numbers)`). Sorting the list is necessary to ensure that the smallest and largest values are the first and last elements, respectively, after sorting.
3. Finally, the function returns a tuple consisting of the first element from the sorted list and the last element from the sorted list, which are the smallest and largest values in the list, respectively. 

The approach is straightforward and efficient, requiring only a few lines of code and no additional dependencies. The function efficiently identifies the closest elements without the need for complex algorithms or additional computations.
