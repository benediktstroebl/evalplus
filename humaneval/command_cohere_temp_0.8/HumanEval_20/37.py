```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    numbers.sort()
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise IndexError("List of numbers must have a minimum of two elements")
    else:
        return (numbers[0], numbers[-1])
```

This function sorts the input list of numbers and returns the pair of the smallest and largest numbers in the list, thus representing the closest elements. It also checks for a minimum list length of 2 and throws an IndexError if the condition isn't met. You can test this function with the provided test cases in the markdown code block above. Just add this code to a Python file (e.g., `find_closest_elements.py`) and run it with `python find_closest_elements.py` to see the results. 
If you encounter any issues running the above code, consider installing a Python interpreter and introducing it to your codebase.
