```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    numbers.sort()
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("At least two numbers must be provided")
    return numbers[0], numbers[-1]
```

Here is a brief explanation of how the code works:
1. The function `find_closest_elements` takes a list of float numbers as an argument.
2. The list is sorted in ascending order using `sort()`.
3. If the sorted list has fewer than two elements, it raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate message.
4. Otherwise, it returns a tuple of the first and last elements of the sorted list, which will be the closest elements in the list.

This approach assumes that the list contains at least two unique elements and that the criteria for "closeness" is their relative proximity in the list. Since the list is sorted, the closest elements will be at opposite ends of the list.
