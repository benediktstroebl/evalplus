This code defines a function `find_closest_elements` which takes a list of float numbers (`List[float])` as an argument, and returns a tuple containing two numbers that are closest to each other in the list. The code initially copies the provided list to ensure that it doesn't modify the original input. It then iterates through all possible pairs of elements in the copied list, calculating the distance between each pair, and keeps track of the pair with the smallest distance. Finally, it returns the two numbers that constitute the identified pair. 

The function handles cases where the input list is insufficiently long with a `ValueError` and the closest pair is guaranteed to be returned as the function uses a brute force method to search all pairs. 

The unit tests that are supposed to be passed with this code are not shown but they would ideally involve testing the function with various input lists and confirming that the output is correct.
