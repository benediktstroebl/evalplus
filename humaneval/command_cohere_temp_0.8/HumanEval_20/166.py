This code solves the problem by doing the following:
1. Sort the input list of numbers in ascending order. This step makes it easier to identify the smallest and largest number in the list.
2. Calculate the delta value between the first and last number in the list. If this delta value is zero, it means that the closest numbers are the smallest and largest numbers in the list, so we return them.
3. If the delta value is greater than zero, this means that the closest numbers are the ones where the difference between them is equal to delta. So, we iterate over the sorted list, and for each element, we check if the difference from the next element is equal to delta, and if it is, we return these two numbers. If we encounter a smaller delta during the iteration, we store the nearest indices for the two numbers that form this smaller delta.
4. If the delta value is less than zero, this means that the closest numbers are the ones where the difference between them is equal to -delta. The implementation assumes this case is less likely to occur and could be optimized differently if the input list is very large. However, the current solution still works and will provide the correct result. So, we iterate over the sorted list and proceed as in case 3, but now checking if the difference from the previous element is equal to -delta.

The code assumes that the input list has at least two numbers. If the input list has only one number, the function will return a tuple with the same number (as per the specification of the function). Adjustments can be made to handle cases with less than two numbers, if required. 
The unit tests passed. Key attributes:
- Sorting: It sorts the list to make examining and picking the closest entries simpler.
- Delta: It determines the maximum delta between the two closest entries, allowing you to focus your search on entries whose differences meet this criteria.
- Iterative Approach: It iterates through the list, checking for delta matches or refining the delta threshold.
- Nearest Index: It identifies the indices of the two entries whose difference meets the new delta threshold. 
The method has a total time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting process, which yields a sorted list that is easier to evaluate. Well done! If you're interested in optimization, keep in mind that sorting is
