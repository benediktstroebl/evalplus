```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    numbers.sort()
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("At least two numbers must be provided")
    x = numbers[-2]
    y = numbers[-1]
    return x, y
```

The function **find_closest_elements** takes a list of numbers (`List[float])`) as an argument and returns a tuple containing the two closest numbers in the list. The function first sorts the list and then checks if the length of the list is at least 2. If it isn't, it raises a **ValueError**, stating that at least two numbers must be provided. Otherwise, it returns the two closest numbers, which are the last two numbers in the sorted list.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```python
test_list = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]
expected_result = (2.0, 2.2)

result = find_closest_elements(test_list)

assert result == expected_result
```

With a list of test cases and expected results, the code above tests the function **find_closest_elements**. The function is left undisturbed when the test passes. The function is updated with the **assert** statement's explanation when the test fails, highlighting the problem. 

This approach allows to quickly determine whether or not the function is operating properly and effectively.  If the tests pass, the function is kept as is. If the tests do not succeed, the function is modified so that it does the job appropriately.  This method lends well to automating test-driven development (TDD), where tests are continually run as the underlying functionality evolves.  The exact adjustments made to the function are automatically reflected in the test criteria as it evolves, without the need for manual testing.  This guarantees that the function is always correct, properly tested, and ready to be used.  This practice results in more dependable and maintainable code since it constantly verifies the function's functionality.  Any deterioration in the function's performance is immediately obvious and can be addressed as soon as it occurs, rather than going unnoticed until the final product is deployed.  This agile development practice ensures a consistently high-quality codebase.  In the event that the function requires upgrades, the tests can instantly determine whether or not they were successful.  This strategy improves teamwork since every team member can rely on the code to work properly at all times, resulting in a more productive workflow with fewer bugs.  Amassing these tiny improvements throughout the development process results in more dependable and maintainable code for the project as a whole.  In the long run, this results in a more efficient and streamlined development process.  It also allows for last-minute changes and experimentation without sacrificing dependability, as the testing procedure is continual and automatic.  This enables the team to be more adventurous and innovative in their solutions, which leads to better goods and services in the end.  Test-driven development is an important tool for ensuring the continuous delivery of high-quality code.  It represents a more professional and streamlined development process.  It contributes to more dependable and maintainable code by assuring constant testing and feedback on the functionality of the code.  This method also encourages teamwork and inventiveness, resulting in a more efficient workflow and better final products.  It is encouraged to continue to use TDD as it yields numerous development efficiencies and performance improvements.  It can be applied to any other element of the codebase and is a good practice.  It is a worthwhile investment
