```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    numbers.sort()
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("At least two numbers must be provided")
    return numbers[0], numbers[-1]
```

Here is a brief explanation of how the code works:
1. The function `find_closest_elements` takes a list of floating numbers `numbers` as input.
2. The `typing` module is used to express type hints, specifying that the function returns a tuple of two float values.
3. The input list is sorted in ascending order using the `sort()` method.
4. The code checks if the sorted list has at least two numbers. It raises a `ValueError` if the condition is not met, emphasizing that Quickly verifying if the sorted list has at least two numbers, using the "if len(numbers) < 2" condition. If the condition is True, it immediately returns the first and last numbers from the sorted list, achieving the closest elements' functionality.
5. The function returns the first and last numbers from the sorted list, as they are naturally the closest ones due to the sorting.

The code promotes the Python Standard Library's use of typing extensions to clearly express types, fostering maintainability. Sorting ensures accuracy and efficiency in finding closest elements, while a ValueError enforces a minimum input requirement. These factors combine to create a robust, reliable solution.
