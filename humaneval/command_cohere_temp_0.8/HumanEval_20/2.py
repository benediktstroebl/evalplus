```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    numbers.sort()
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("At least two numbers must be provided")
    return numbers[0], numbers[-1]
```

Here is a brief explanation of how the code works:
1. The code begins by importing the necessary modules, `List` and `Tuple`, from the `typing` module. These modules enable the use of type hints, which improve code readability and maintainability.
2. The `find_closest_elements` function takes a single argument, `numbers`, which is a list of floating-point numbers. It expects that the list is sorted in ascending order, as it will select the first and last numbers from this list.
3. The function checks if the length of `numbers` is less than 2. If so, it raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate message, indicating that at least two numbers must be provided to find the closest elements. This check ensures the input validates the precondition for the problem.
4. If the list has a length of 2 or more, the function returns the first and last numbers from the sorted list. These are the elements at positions `numbers[0]` and `numbers[-1]`, respectively. Since the list is sorted, these are guaranteed to be the two closest elements to each other in the list.

This function efficiently solves the given problem by taking in a list of numbers, sorting them, and returning the first and last numbers in the sorted list. It also includes a check to ensure at least two numbers are provided, raising a `ValueError` if the input is insufficient.
