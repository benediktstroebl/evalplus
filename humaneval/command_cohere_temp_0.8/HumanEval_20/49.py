```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    numbers.sort()
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("At least two numbers must be provided")
    else:
        diff = numbers[-1] - numbers[0]
        if abs(diff) < 1e-5:
            return (numbers[0], numbers[0])
        else:
            return (numbers[0], numbers[-1])
```
The function first sorts the input list of numbers and checks if the list has at least two elements. If the length of the list is less than 2, it raises a `ValueError` indicating that a list with at least two numbers is required, but eventually, it returns the closest integer. Otherwise, it checks whether the difference between the first (smallest) and the last (largest) element of the sorted list is smaller than 1e-5 (approximately 0.0). If so, it returns the same number twice, flagged as a tuple. Otherwise, it assumes the first number as the closest match to the second and returns both. 

Here is a simple test suite that can be used to verify the function:
```python
def test_find_closest_elements():
    assert find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]) == (2.0, 2.2)
    assert find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]) == (2.0, 2.0)
    assert find_closest_elements([10.0, 8.0, 6.0, 4.0, 12.0, 11.0, 9.0]) == (10.0, 10.0)
    assert find_closest_elements([1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0]) == (1.0, 2.0)
    assert find_closest_elements([10.0, 9.0, 8.0, 7.0, 6.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0]) == (2.0, 3.0)
``` 
The test suite contains a variety of lists of numbers of different lengths, and the output of the function is compared to the expected values. 
If the `find_closest_elements` function is correctly implemented and the tests are accurate, all tests should pass without raising any errors or exceptions. 
This will confirm the accuracy and correctness of the function in solving the problem.  If the function is not yet fully implemented or needs adjustments, the tests will help reveal the gaps and shortcomings. 
This approach allows to validate the function step by step and ensure it is working as expected.
