```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    numbers.sort()
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("At least two numbers must be provided")
    return numbers[0], numbers[-1]
```

Here is a brief explanation of how the code works:
1. The function `find_closest_elements` takes a list of floating numbers `numbers` as input.
2. The `sort()` method is used to sort the numbers in ascending order.
3. Then, a simple validation is performed to check if the length of the `numbers` list is greater than or equal to 2, raising a `ValueError` if it's less than 2. This is to ensure that the list contains at least two numbers to be able to select the closest pair.
4. Finally, it returns the first and last numbers from the sorted list, which, in theory, should be the closest to each other, as they lie at both ends of the range of values. 

This approach assumes that the list contains at least two unique values and that the closest pair is the one consisting of the smallest and largest values in the list.
