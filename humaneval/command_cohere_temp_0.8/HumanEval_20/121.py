```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    numbers.sort()
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("At least two numbers must be provided")
    else:
        difference = numbers[-1] - numbers[0]
        if difference == 0:
            return numbers[0], numbers[0]
        elif difference > 0:
            for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
                if numbers[i] - numbers[i - 1] < difference:
                    difference = numbers[i] - numbers[i - 1]
                    smaller, larger = numbers[i - 1], numbers[i]
        else:
            for i in range(len(numbers) - 2, -1, -1):
                if numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i] < difference:
                    difference = numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i]
                    smaller, larger = numbers[i], numbers[i + 1]
        return smaller, larger
```

The function first sorts the input list of numbers, then checks if the list has at least two numbers. If not, it raises a `ValueError`. Otherwise, it iterates through the list to find the two numbers with the smallest absolute difference between them.

This approach ensures that the correct closest elements are found and handles various edge cases, meeting the problem requirements. You can use this code to solve the problem directly and pass the provided tests. Feel free to ask any further questions or explore additional concepts as needed.
