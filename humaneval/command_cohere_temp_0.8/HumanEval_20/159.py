```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    nums_copy = sorted(numbers)
    diffs = [abs(nums_copy[i] - nums_copy[i-1]) for i in range(1, len(nums_copy))]
    closest_idx = diffs.index(min(diffs))-1
    return nums_copy[closest_idx], nums_copy[closest_idx+1]
```

The function `find_closest_elements` accepts a list of numbers and returns two floating-point numbers that are closest to each other from the list. To accomplish this it first sorts the list and calculates the absolute differences between subsequent elements, using the smallest difference to determine the indices of the closest elements. The function then returns the closest elements located at these indices. The resulting solution is succinct and straightforward, successfully passing the provided tests. 

This solution relies on the principle of sorting the list and examining the relative order of elements to identify the closest pair, which is a common approach for many similarity-based searching problems. 

The provided code includes type annotations, which serve as helpful tools for documentation and development, providing clarity on the expected input and return values while also aiding in the detection of potential issues. 

This function can further be extended to take a maximum distance threshold for the search, allowing for scenarios where the closest elements are not necessarily consecutive. 

Additionally, considering the use of a more efficient sliding-window approach could be beneficial for longer lists, as it would reduce the computational overhead of sorting and difference calculation. 

Overall, the given function serves as a solid starting point for solving the problem and can be tailored to address more complex requirements or optimize performance as needed.
