Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the problem:
```python
import math

def poly(coefficients: list, x: float) -> float:
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(coefficients)])


def find_zero(coefficients: list) -> float:
    """
    Finds a solution x for the polynomial equation poly(x) = 0.
    Only returns the first solution, if multiple solutions exist.
    Only works for lists of coefficients with an even number of items
    and the largest non-zero coefficient.
    """
    # Check if list has an even number of coefficients and a non-zero largest coefficient
    if len(coefficients) % 2 == 0 and coefficients[-1] != 0:
        # Calculate the polynomial value at the midpoint
        mid = (coefficients[-1] / 2)
        # If midpoint is a root, return it
        if poly(coefficients, mid) == 0:
            return mid
        # Calculate the polynomial value at x = mid + 1
        val = poly(coefficients, mid + 1)
        # If this value is 0, return x = mid + 1
        if val == 0:
            return mid + 1
        # Calculate the polynomial value at x = mid - 1
        val = poly(coefficients, mid - 1)
        # If this value is 0, return x = mid - 1
        if val == 0:
            return mid - 1
        # Calculate the rate of change of the polynomial value at x = mid
        rate = (poly(coefficients, mid + 1) - poly(coefficients, mid - 1)) / 2
        # Calculate the next potential root using the rate of change
        next_root = mid - rate
        # If the next potential root is within bounds, return it
        if next_root >= 0 and next_root <= 1:
            return next_root
    return None
```

This script includes two functions. The first function, `poly`, evaluates a polynomial given a list of coefficients and a variable value. The second function, `find_zero`, finds the zero value for a polynomial given a list of coefficients. This function only returns the first zero value if there are multiple solutions. It also only works with polynomials that have an even number of coefficients and the largest non-zero coefficient, as these are the conditions under which there must be at least one root.

These functions are designed to work with polynomial equations of the form:
```
xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ... + xs[n] * x^n = 0
```

The `find_zero` function first checks if the list of coefficients has an even length and if the largest coefficient is non-zero. If these conditions are met, it then checks some initial points to find a root. Specifically, it checks the point `xs[0] / 2` and if this point is a root, it returns it. If not, it checks the polynomial values at `x = xs[0] / 2 + 1` and `x = xs[0] / 2 - 1` to see if either of these points is a root. If neither of these points is a root, it then calculates the rate of change of the polynomial value at `x = xs[0] / 2` and uses this to
