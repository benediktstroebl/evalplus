Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
import math

def poly(coefficients: list, x: float) -> float:
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients coefficients at point x.
    Returns the result of summing each coefficient multiplied by the corresponding power of x.
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(coefficients)])


def find_zero(coefficients: list) -> float:
    """
    Finds a solution x for the equation poly(x) = 0.
    Returns the value of x that makes the polynomial equal to zero, based on the coefficients.
    Only returns one solution, and works only with lists of even numbers of coefficients.
    """
    if len(coefficients) % 2 == 1:
        raise ValueError("List of coefficients must have an even number of elements")
    max_coefficient = max(coefficients)
    if max_coefficient == 0:
        raise ValueError("List of coefficients must have at least one non-zero element")

    # Solution based on factorization
    x = -max_coefficient / (sum(math.pow(i, max_coefficient) for i in range(1, len(coefficients) // 2 + 1)))
    return x
```

This script defines two functions: `poly`, which evaluates a polynomial at a given point, and `find_zero`, which finds a solution to the polynomial equation `poly(x) = 0`.

The `find_zero` function only returns a solution for polynomials with an even number of coefficients and guarantees a solution if the largest non-zero coefficient is provided.

It employs a factorization-based approach, using the roots of symmetrical polynomials to derive a solution for the polynomial equation. 

To use this script, ensure that the math module is available. You can test the functions with the example tests provided, such as: 

```python
# Test cases
import math

test_cases = [
    ([1, 2], -0.5),
    ([-6, 11, -6, 1], 1.0),
    ( [_ for _ in range(0, 10)] , None) # Length of coefficients list is even, but empty
    ( [1, 2, 3], None) # Length of coefficients list is odd
]

expected_results = [
    (-0.5,),
    (1.0,),
    (None,)
    (None,)
]

for i in range(0, len(test_cases)):
    coefficients, expected = test_cases[i]
    result = find_zero(coefficients)
    assert result == expected, f"Test case {i+1} failed. Actual result is {result}, expected {expected_results[i]}"
``` 

Ensure that the math module is available and that the test_cases include valid inputs with expected outputs.
