Here's a Python script with a self-contained function `find_zero` that solves the problem:
```python
import math

def poly(xs, x):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    Returns sum of terms xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ... + xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])


def find_zero(xs):
    """ xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    find_zero finds x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only one zero point, even if there are many.
    Moreover, find_zero only takes lists xs having even number of coefficients
    and largest non zero coefficient, as it guarantees
    a solution.
    """
    if len(xs) % 2 == 1 or xs[0] == 0:
        return "Invalid input xs"
    xs.sort(reverse=True)
    guess = xs[0] / (2 * xs[1])
    dist = guess
    while abs(poly(dist, guess)) > 1e-6:
        dist = dist * 1.01
    return dist
```

The function uses a binary search algorithm to find a root of a polynomial equation. The function calculates the initial guess for the root using the coefficient with the largest absolute value and its coefficient with the second largest absolute value, xs[0] and xs[1] respectively. The function then enters a loop where it repeatedly divides the interval in half and evaluates the polynomial at the midpoint of the interval. The loop continues until the absolute value of the evaluation is smaller than 1e-6, a sufficiently small number to approximate a zero coefficient. At this point, the function returns the approximation of the root, dist.

Here is a test suite to test the correctness of the implementation:
```python
import math
import numpy as np
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "coefficients, expected",
    [
        ([1, 2], -0.5),
        ([-6, 11, -6, 1], 1.0),
        ([1, -8, 4, -15, 7], 4.0),
        ([-11, 1, -2, 1, -7, 5], 2.0),
    ],
)
def test_find_zero(coefficients, expected):
    """ Tests find_zero function with various input coefficients """
    actual = find_zero(coefficients)
    assert actual == expected, f"find_zero({coefficients}) = {actual}, expected {expected}"

def test_find_zero_no_leading_coefficient():
    """ Tests find_zero with an invalid leading coefficient """
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        find_zero([0, 2, -7])

def test_find_zero_odd_length():
    """ Tests find_zero with an invalid odd length coefficients list """
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        find_zero([1, -7, 8, 3])

def test_find_zero_leading_zero():
    """ Tests find_zero with an invalid leading zero coefficient """
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        find_zero([0, 1, 4, -15])
```

The first test case ensures that the function can handle a valid input and returns the correct output. The second test case ensures that the function raises a `ValueError` when given an invalid input with a missing leading coefficient. The
