Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the problem:
```python
import math

def poly(coefficients: list, x: float) -> float:
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    Returns sum of terms xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(coefficients)])

def find_zero(coefficients: list) -> float:
    """
    Finds a solution x for the equation poly(x) = 0.
    Works only for lists with even number of coefficients, 
    and guarantees a solution only if the list has the largest non-zero coefficient.
    Returns one solution x.
    """
    if len(coefficients) % 2 == 1:
        raise ValueError('List of coefficients must have an even number of elements')
    max_index = len(coefficients) - 1
    if coefficients[max_index] == 0:
        raise ValueError('List of coefficients must have the largest non-zero coefficient')

    x = -coefficients[max_index] / (2 * poly(coefficients[:max_index], coefficients[max_index]))
    return x
```

The function find_zero will find a solution for the equation poly(x) = 0. It works by observing the symmetry of the polynomial around the x-axis and the fact that the polynomial equals zero at its extreme value. Essentially, we're finding the root of the polynomial to achieve zero and ensure it's symmetric around the x-axis and the largest coefficient is adjusted to zero.

Here's a test suite to ensure it operates correctly:
```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    'coefficients, expected',
    [
        ([1, 2], -0.5),
        ([-6, 11, -6, 1], 1.0),
        ([1, -2, 3, -4, 5], 2.0),
        ([-2, 4, -6, 8, -10, 12], 3.0),
    ]
)
def test_find_zero(coefficients, expected):
    """ Tests find_zero() for various input coefficients """
    result = find_zero(coefficients)
    assert abs(result - expected) < 1e-6  # Error margin for floating point comparisons

def test_find_zero_error_odd_length():
    """ Tests find_zero() when passed list of coefficients with odd length """
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        find_zero([1, 2, 3])

def test_find_zero_error_no_largest_nonzero():
    """ Tests find_zero() when passed list of coefficients without largest non-zero coefficient """
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        find_zero([1, -2, 3, -4])
