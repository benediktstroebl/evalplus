Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the problem:
```python
import math

def poly(coefficients: list, x: float) -> float:
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    Returns sum of terms xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(coefficients)])

def find_zero(coefficients: list) -> float:
    """
    Finds a solution x for the equation poly(x) = 0.
    Only returns the first solution, even if there are multiple zeros.
    Works only for lists with an even number of coefficients,
    and with the maximum absolute value non-zero coefficient.
    """
    # your code here, basically solve the equation by adapting an analytical method chosen
    # probably not the worst idea to start with bisection method
    if len(coefficients) % 2 == 1 or max(abs(coefficient) for coefficient in coefficients if coefficient) == 0:
        return "The input list of coefficients is not suitable for finding a solution"
    elif len(coefficients) == 2:
        return -coefficients[0] / (2 * coefficients[1])
    else:
        small = 1e-6
        big = 1e6
        x_mid = (small + big) / 2
        # we assume that the solution is somewhere in this interval
        for _ in range(205):  # Number of iterations chosen arbitrarily
            # but it better be enough...
            if poly(coefficients, x_mid) == 0:
                return x_mid
            elif poly(coefficients, x_mid) > 0:
                small = x_mid
            else:
                big = x_mid
            x_mid = (small + big) / 2
        return "Solution not found"
```
This script defines the poly() function to evaluate the polynomial given a list of coefficients and a value for x. The find_zero() function attempts to find the solution for the polynomial equation poly(x) = 0. It starts with an initial interval defined by [1e-6, 1e6], and it uses a bisection method to find the solution. The function will return the solution if found, or if the solution is not in the defined interval it will return "Solution not found"

The find_zero() function is designed to work only with lists of coefficients that have an even number of coefficients and where the absolute value of the largest non-zero coefficient is greater than 0. If the input list does not meet these criteria, the function returns an error message.  This is to ensure that the function works correctly and efficiently to find the solution for polynomials where it is guaranteed to exist, based on the provided constraints.
