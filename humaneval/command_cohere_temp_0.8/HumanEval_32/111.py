Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the problem:
```python
import math

def poly(coefficients: list, x: float) -> float:
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients coefficients at point x.
    Returns the result of summing each coefficient multiplied by the corresponding power of x.
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(coefficients)])


def find_zero(coefficients: list) -> float:
    """
    Finds a solution x for the equation poly(x) = 0.
    Returns the value of x that makes the polynomial equal to zero, based on the coefficients.
    Requires an even number of coefficients and assumes the largest non-zero coefficient is the dominant term.
    """
    if len(coefficients) % 2 == 1:
        raise ValueError("List coefficients must have an even number of elements.")
    if coefficients[-1] == 0:
        raise ValueError("Last coefficient must be non-zero.")

    # Determine the exponent of the dominant term
    dominant_exponent = len(coefficients) - 1
    while coefficients[dominant_expperient] != coefficients[-1]:
        if coefficients[dominant_exponent] == 0:
            raise ValueError("Cannot find zero: last non-zero coefficient is not the dominant term.")
        dominant_exponent -= 1

    # Calculate the reciprocal of the dominant term
    dominant_coeff = 1 / coefficients[-1]
    x = dominant_coeff - (len(coefficients) - 1) * dominant_coeff * dominant_exponent

    # Refine the solution
    refinement_exponent = len(coefficients) - 2
    x_refinement = (x / coefficients[refinement_exponent]) - refinement_exponent
    return x_refinement
```

This script defines the functions `poly` and `find_zero` as described in the prompt. Furthermore, the script includes unit tests that verify the correctness of these functions. You can execute these tests by adding the following lines at the end of the script:
```python
# Test find_zero for a simple polynomial
assert round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2) == -0.5

# Test find_zero for a polynomial with more terms
assert round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2) == 1.0

# Test error handling for invalid input
try:
    find_zero([1, 2, 3])
except ValueError as e:
    assert str(e) == "List coefficients must have an even number of elements."

try:
    find_zero([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
except ValueError as e:
    assert str(e) == "Last coefficient must be non-zero."

try:
    find_zero([1, -2, 3, 4])
except ValueError as e:
    assert str(e) == "Cannot find zero: last non-zero coefficient is not the dominant term."
``` 

To test the error handling for more specific cases, you may need to adjust the test values.
