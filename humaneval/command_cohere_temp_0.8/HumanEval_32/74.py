Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the problem:
```python
import math

def poly(coefficients: list, x: float) -> float:
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients coefficients at point x.
    Returns the value of the polynomial at x, given as sum(coeff * x^i for i, coeff in enumerate(coefficients)).
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(coefficients)])


def find_zero(coefficients: list) -> float:
    """
    Finds a solution x for the equation poly(x) = 0.
    Only returns the first solution founds, in case there are multiple zeros.

    Only accepts lists of even numbers of coefficients, and checks that the list contains the largest coefficient.
    """
    if len(coefficients) % 2 == 1 or max(coefficients) == 0:
        return "Error: List of coefficients must have an even number of elements and contain the largest coefficient."

    # Make sure that we have an even number of coefficients and that the list contains the largest non-zero coefficient
    # This is important to guarantee that we will find a solution
    x = find_zero_bruteforce(coefficients)
    return x


def find_zero_bruteforce(coefficients: list) -> float:
    """
    Brute force algorithm to find zero of polynomial.
    Simply runs through possible x values and checks if poly(x) = 0.
    This algorithm is far from efficient, but serves as a simple illustration.
    In a real setting you would use e.g. newton method.
    """
    x_values = list(range(0, 10))
    for x in x_values:
        if poly(coefficients, x) == 0:
            return x
    return None
```

This script defines two functions: `poly(coefficients, x)` evaluates the polynomial with the given coefficients at the point x, and `find_zero(coefficients)` finds the value of x where poly(x) = 0. 

The `find_zero` function first checks that the list of coefficients contains the largest non-zero coefficient and that the list has an even number of elements. It then calls the `find_zero_bruteforce` function to find the zero of the polynomial. 

The `find_zero_bruteforce` function loops through a list of potential x values and checks if evaluating the polynomial at x results in 0. The first such x value is returned. 

Both functions are self-contained and can be run independently.
