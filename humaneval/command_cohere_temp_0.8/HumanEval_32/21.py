Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the problem of finding a zero point of a polynomial:
```python
import math

def poly(xs: list, x: float) -> float:
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])


def find_zero(xs: list) -> float:
    n = len(xs)
    m = n // 2
    if n % 2 == 1 or xs[m] == 0:
        return None
    xs[0], xs[m] = xs[m], xs[0]
    x = (xs[m]**2 - xs[1]) / (24 * xs[m] + xs[m]**2)
    return x

# Test cases
assert find_zero([1, 2]) == -0.5, "Failed test case 1"
assert find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]) == 1.0, "Failed test case 2"

# Example usage
polynomial_coefficients = [2, -5, 3]
zero_point = find_zero(polynomial_coefficients)
print(f"Zero point of polynomial {polynomial_coefficients} is at x = {zero_point}")
```

This script includes the `poly` function, which evaluates the polynomial given its coefficients `xs` at a point `x`. The `find_zero` function attempts to find the zero point of a polynomial with even coefficients, and it returns the found zero point, or `None` if the coefficients do not meet the requirements or there is no zero point. Test cases are included to ensure the function works correctly for the given examples.
