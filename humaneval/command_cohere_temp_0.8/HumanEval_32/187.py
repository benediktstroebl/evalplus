Here's a Python script that includes a function to solve the problem:
```python
import math

def poly(coefficients: list, x: float) -> float:
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients coefficients at point x.
    Returns the result of summing each coefficient multiplied by the corresponding power of x.
    
    Parameters:
        - coefficients: A list of floats representing the coefficients of the polynomial.
        - x: The point at which to evaluate the polynomial.
        
    Returns:
        - Result of evaluating the polynomial at x.
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(coefficients)])


def find_zero(coefficients: list) -> float:
    """
    Finds a solution x for the equation polynomial == 0.
    Returns one solution x such that poly(x) = 0, based on the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm.
    
    Parameters:
        - coefficients: List of coefficients of a polynomial with even number of coefficients.
        
    Returns:
        - A float value for the solution x.
    """
    # Ensure that the provided coefficients list has even length and at least 2 elements.
    if len(coefficients) < 2 or len(coefficients) % 2:
        raise ValueError("coefficients list must have even number of coefficients")
        
    # Sort coefficients descending and negate to make polynomial monic
    coefficients.sort(reverse=True)
    lead = -coefficients[0]
    res = lead
    
    for i in range(1, len(coefficients)):
        tmp = lead
        lead = res - coefficients[i] * res // tmp
        
    return lead
```

This script includes two functions: `poly(coefficients, x)` evaluates a polynomial at a given point, and `find_zero(coefficients)` finds the point at which a polynomial is equal to zero. The `find_zero` function implements the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm to find a single solution for the equation `p(x) = 0`, assuming the polynomial has even coefficients and the list of coefficients contains the highest magnitude non-zero coefficient.

These functions are well-commented and should be self-explanatory. They are also robust and handle potential exceptions, such as if an input list has an odd number of elements or if no coefficients are provided.
