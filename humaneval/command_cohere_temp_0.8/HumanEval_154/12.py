This function takes two words as input, and returns True if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word. It achieves this by first converting the input words to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive matching. It then checks if the second word itself is a substring of the first word. If not, it generates possible rotations of the second word and checks if any of these rotations exist within the first word. 

The function's methodology allows for efficient and thorough evaluation of the cyclic pattern match, ensuring that the match condition is accurately determined for the given input words.
