```python
def cycpattern_check(word1, word2):
    """
    You are given 2 words. You need to return True if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word.
    """
    if len(word1) < len(word2):
        return False
    if word2 in word1:
        return True
    for i in range(len(word2)):
        if word2[i:] in word1 or word2[:i] in word1:
            return True
    return False
```

The function `cycpattern_check()` takes in two words as input, and returns a boolean value that determines whether the second word can be rotated to become a substring of the first word. The function uses the len() function to check if the first word is longer than the second word, returning False immediately if it is not. It checks if the second word is a substring of the first word using the in operator, and returns True if it is. The function also uses a for loop to iterate through each character of the second word to check if any rotation of the second word is a substring of the first word, and returns True if it is. If none of these conditions are met, the function returns False.

This solution has a time complexity of O(N^2) due to the use of nested for loops, making it inefficient for large inputs. It is recommended to use more efficient algorithms like the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm (KMP) to solve this problem more efficiently.
