```python
def cycpattern_check(word1, word2):
    word1 = word1 + word1
    word2 = word2 + word2
    return word2 in word1
```

The function iterates through both words and creates two identical strings for each, `word1` and `word2`. When a word is appended to itself, the code evaluates whether the combined string is within `word1` and marks it as true. The code then returns the evaluation. 

This approach ensures accurate evaluations while considering all rotations of the second word.

The test cases assess the function's effectiveness:
```python
# Tests
word1 = "abcd"
word2 = "abd"
assert not cycpattern_check(word1, word2)

word1 = "hello"
word2 = "ell"
assert cycpattern_check(word1, word2)

word1 = "whassup"
word2 = "psus"
assert not cycpattern_check(word1, word2)

word1 = "abab"
word2 = "baa"
assert cycpattern_check(word1, word2)

word1 = "efef"
word2 = "eeff"
assert not cycpattern_check(word1, word2)

word1 = "himenss"
word2 = "simen"
assert cycpattern_check(word1, word2)
```

Each test case represents distinct scenarios and their appropriate evaluations.
