```python
def cycpattern_check(first, second):
    return second in set(word for word in (second, *second[1:], second[1:0]) if word in first)
```

The problem is quite intuitive, we need to check if the second word is a substring in the first word or any of its rotations. We can achieve this in Python using string manipulation and set operations. An important observation is that the rotations of a string can be generated by taking substrings of different lengths from the original string.

We take the second string and its rotations (obtained using the `*second[1:], second[1:0]` trick) and check if any of these are present in the first string. We use the `set` function which unifies the duplicate rotations and makes our check efficient. The `in` operator completes the job.
