```

The function `cycpattern_check` uses the `permutations` function to generate all possible rotations of the second string, and then checks if any of these rotations match a substring in the first string using the `in` operator. 

To ensure that the code handles punctuations and other special characters, the `permutations` function uses a slicing technique to create new permutations. This is done without excluding any character, and that allows punctuations and special characters to be treated equally.
