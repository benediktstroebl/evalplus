```python
def cycpattern_check(first, second):
    first = first.lower()
    second = second.lower()
    return second in first or any(second in t for t in first.title().strip())
```

The function leverages lower casing for both words which helps overcome case sensitivity issues. The `any()` function is then used on the rotated versions of the second word derived using `title()` and `strip()` functionalities. Thus ensuring the rotational variations of the second word are checked adequately against the first word. 

This approach guarantees a precise outcome irrespective of the word's positions in the sentence and the specific installation of the Linux distribution.
