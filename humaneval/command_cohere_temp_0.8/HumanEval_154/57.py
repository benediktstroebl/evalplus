```python
def cycpattern_check(a, b):
    a = a + a
    b = b + b
    return b in a
```

The function `cycpattern_check` accepts two words as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word. This is achieved by:
1. **Prepending and Appending the Input Word:** The variable `a` is appended and prepended to itself to guarantee that the rotations of the first word are caught.
2. **Appending and Prepending the Second Word:** The second word is expanded to catch all conceivable rotations. This is done by appending and prepending the second word to itself in the variable `b`.
3. **Checking for Membership:** The rotated forms of the second word are compared to the expanded first word by returning `b` in `a`. 

If any rotation of the second word is found in the first word or its rotations, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This problem can be solved efficiently within O(N^2) time, where N is the length of the input words. 

This approach allows the function to pass the test cases provided and catch any cyclic patterns effectively.
