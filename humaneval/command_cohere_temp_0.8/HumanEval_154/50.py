```python
def cycpattern_check(word1, word2):
    rotations = [word2[i:i+len(word2)//2] for i in range(0, len(word2), len(word2)//2)]
    return any(sub in word1 for sub in rotations)
```

The function 'cycpattern_check' accepts two words as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word. To do this, we first create a list of all rotations of the second word, ensuring that each rotation is of length half the original by using a step of `len(word2) // 2` when creating the list. Then, we iterate over each rotation with a list comprehension, checking if any of them are present in the first word using the `in` operator. This allows us to determine if the second word or any of its rotations are substrings in the first word. 

This problem can be solved in various ways, such as by using hash tables, but the use of list comprehension above is a straightforward and effective approach. 

To use this function and see if it passes the given tests, you can copy and paste it into a Python environment or script and run the function as demonstrated in the code snippet below:
```python
# Call the function with test cases
print(cycpattern_check("abcd", "abd"))  # Expected output: False
print(cycpattern_check("hello", "ell"))  # Expected output: True
print(cycpattern_check("whassup", "psus"))  # Expected output: False
print(cycpattern_check("abab", "baa"))  # Expected output: True
print(cycpattern_check("efef", "eeff"))  # Expected output: False
print(cycpattern_check("himenss", "simen"))  # Expected output: True
``` 
This will print out the truth values represented by 'True' and 'False' for each test case, which should match the expected output as stated in the problem statement.
