```python
def cycpattern_check(a, b):
    a, b = a.lower(), b.lower()
    return any(b in s for s in a) or any(a == s[:len(a)] for s in b)
```

The function leverages list comprehension and the any function to check if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word. It operates on two strings `a` and `b`, where `a` is the larger string and `b` is the smaller string. The function is case-insensitive by converting both strings to lowercase using the `lower()` method. It first checks if any rotation of the smaller string `b` is a substring in the larger string `a`. Additionally, it verifies if any rotation of the larger string `a` is equal to the smaller string `b`. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns True, indicating a cyclic pattern. Otherwise, it returns False.
