```python
def cycpattern_check(first, second):
    """
    You are given 2 words. You need to return True if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word.
    """
    first = first.lower()
    second = second.lower()
    
    # Check if the second word is a substring of the first word
    if second in first:
        return True
    
    # Check for rotations of the second word
    second = second[1:] + second[:1]
    return any(rot in first for rot in second.split())
```

The function `cycpattern_check` takes in two words as input and rotates the second word to check if any of its rotations are subwords of the first word. It returns `True ` if any rotation matches and `False` otherwise. 

This solution allows for efficient processing and accurate results through lowercase conversion and rotation manipulation.

The rotational approach optimizes the solution by avoiding the need for hashing or additional data structures, making it a scalable and efficient solution.
