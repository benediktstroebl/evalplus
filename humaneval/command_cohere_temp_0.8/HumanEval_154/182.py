This code provides a function that takes two words as input and returns a boolean value depending on whether the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word. The function uses a simple trick of concatenating the first word with itself to help find rotations and check for their presence in the first word. The rotated versions of the second word are created using a helper function `__rotation_helper` that iterates through possible pivot points (positions where the substring of interest might be found) and creates rotated versions accordingly. 

The code also includes a set of test cases that exercise the function with different scenarios and verifies its correctness against the problem statement's requirements.
