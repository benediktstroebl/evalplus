```python
def cycpattern_check(word1, word2):
    rotations = [word2[i:] + word2[:i] for i in range(len(word2))]
    return any(sub in word1 for sub in rotations)
```

The function `cycpattern_check` accepts two words as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word. To do this, we create a list of all possible rotations of the second word and check if any of them are present in the first word using the `any` function. This allows us to pass or fail each test case based on the problem statement's guidelines.
