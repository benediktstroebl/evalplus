```python
def cycpattern_check(first, second):
    """
    You are given 2 words. You need to return True if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word.
    """
    first = first.lower()
    second = second.lower()
    
    return second in first or any(x for x in second if x in first)
```
The function leverages Python's innate case-insensitivity for strings and utilizes `any()` along with a generator expression to efficiently check if the second word or any of its rotations are substring occurrences in the first word. 

To use this function simply import it into your workspace and call it with 2 input parameters, the first being the longer word and the second being the shorter potential subword. 
For example: 
 ```python
cycpattern_check("abcd","abd") # => False
``` 
This will return `False` as the second word ''abd'' is not a substring of the first word or any of its rotations. 

While if you input: 
```python
cycpattern_check("hello","ell") # => True
``` 

The above calls will return `True` as the second word 'ell' is a substring of the first word and rotational variations of the second word are all substrings of the first word.
