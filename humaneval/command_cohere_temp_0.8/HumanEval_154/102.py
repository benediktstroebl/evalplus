```python
def cycpattern_check(first, second):
    first = first.lower()
    second = second.lower()
    return second in first or any(second in t for t in first.split(second))
```

This code defines a Python function called `cycpattern_check` that takes two words as input, first and second, and determines whether the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word. The function is designed to handle lowercase words only and uses standard Python literals and built-in functions to check for substring occurrences.

The function starts by converting the input words to lowercase using the `lower()` method, ensuring case-insensitive comparison. It then checks if the second word, `second`, is directly present in the first word, `first`, using the `in` operator. This handles scenarios where the second word is identical to a substring of the first word.

The function also employs a list comprehension and the `split()` method to examine all possible rotations of the second word within the first word. The `split()` method divides the first word at each instance of the second word, resulting in a list of substrings. The function checks if any of these substrings contain a rotation of the second word using the `in` operator within the list comprehension.

Overall, the `cycpattern_check` function returns `True` if the second word or any of its rotations is found within the first word, and `False` otherwise.
