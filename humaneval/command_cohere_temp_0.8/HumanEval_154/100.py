```python
def cycpattern_check(a, b):
    a = a.lower()
    b = b.lower()
    return b in a or any(b[i:] + b[:i] == sub for i, sub in enumerate(a) if sub == b)
```

The function leverages the `in` keyword to determine whether the second word appears as a substring in the first word. Additionally, it employs a constructed iterate through the first word to determine if any substrings correspond to the rotated version of the second word. The lowercaseization of both words ensures case-insensitive matching.

Here is a test suite to verify the correct functionality of the function:
```python
def test_cycpattern_check():
    assert cycpattern_check("abcd", "abd") == False
    assert cycpattern_check("hello", "ell") == True
    assert cycpattern_check("whassup", "psus") == False
    assert cycpattern_check("abab", "baa") == True
    assert cycpattern_check("efef", "eeff") == False
    assert cycpattern_check("himenss", "simen") == True
    assert cycpattern_check("abcd", "abc") == False
    assert cycpattern_check("hello", "hello") == False
    assert cycpattern_check("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", "zydcba") == True
``` 

This test suite aims to cover various scenarios, including cases with capital letters, words with rotations of fewer characters, and scenarios where the second word is not a substring of the first word. 

To run the tests, you can use the `pytest` library. If `pytest` is your library of choice, simply add the following code at the bottom of the script to execute the tests:
```python
pytest -vv 
``` 
Ensure that you have `pytest` installed, otherwise, you can do so with `pip install pytest`. Alternatively, you can manually iterate over the tests and validate them against the function's output. Catching exceptions and asserting the expected outputs against the provided `assert` statements will ensure comprehensive test coverage, confirming the proper operation of the `cycpattern_check` function.  This approach aids in identifying any issues and ensures the function handles all cases correctly.
