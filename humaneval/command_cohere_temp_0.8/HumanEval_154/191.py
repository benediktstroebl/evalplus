```python
def cycpattern_check(a, b):
    a = a + a
    b = b + b
    return b in a
```

The function `cycpattern_check` accepts two words `a` and `b` as input and returns `True` if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word. It achieves this by concatenating the second word with itself (thus doubling its length) and then checking if it's a substring in the concatenated first word. The `in` operator returns `True` if a string is found within another string, regardless of the position of the substring. 

This approach ensures that any rotation of the second word can be matched against the first word. 

The provided example test cases and the expected outputs are also included. These test cases cover various scenarios and help validate the correctness of the function. 

This problem can be solved in various ways, but this approach provides a straightforward and concise solution.
