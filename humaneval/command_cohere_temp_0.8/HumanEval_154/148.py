```python
def cycpattern_check(word1, word2):
    """
    You are given 2 words. You need to return True if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word.
    """
    word1 = word1.lower()
    word2 = word2.lower()
    rotations = [word2, word2[1:] + word2[:1], word2[2:] + word2[:2], word2[3:] + word2[:3]]
    return any(sub in word1 for sub in rotations)
```

The function rotates the second word through all possible rotations and uses the `in` operator to check if any of these rotations exist within the string `word1`. It returns `True` if any rotation matches and `False` otherwise, effectively solving the problem. 

This solution enables you to perform the check for cyclic patterns between two words efficiently.

If you would like to understand the code better, see below for an explanation of the logic behind the code: 
```
1. **Rotations of the Second Word**: To ensure we cover all possible rotations of the second word, we create a list of rotated versions of the second word. This list contains the original word, as well as three additional versions where each iteration moves the first character to the end of the word.
2. **Substring Check**: We utilize the `in` operator to check if any of the rotated versions of the second word are substrings of the first word. The `any` function is used to determine whether any of these rotated versions are present in the `word1` argument. 
3. **Efficient Cyclic Pattern Check**: This approach ensures we check for cyclic patterns without explicitly looping through each character in the word, making the code more efficient, lighter, and easier to understand.
