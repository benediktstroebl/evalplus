```python
def cycpattern_check(a, b):
    a = a + a
    b = b + b
    return b in a
```

The function `cycpattern_check` accepts two words as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word. This is achieved by:
1. Taking no-op transformations (`a` to `a` and `b` to `b`) out of the picture as word rotations.
2. Creating new words `a_expanded` and `b_expanded` by concatenating the input words `a` and `b` with themselves (`a + a` and `b + b`).
3. Checking if `b_expanded` is a substring of `a_expanded` by using the in operator.

This solution follows the **incremental construction** approach, a powerful methodology to tackle problems: solve a simpler problem that is a subset of the original problem, and then incrementally solve harder variations until you reach the original problem. This is a straightforward solution to the problem and should be the first approach considered, especially if the problem statement mentions nothing about constrains on time or space complexity.
