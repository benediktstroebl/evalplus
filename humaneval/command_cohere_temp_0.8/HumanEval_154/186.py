```python
def cycpattern_check(a, b):
    a = a + a
    b = b + b
    return b in a
```

The function `cycpattern_check` takes two strings `a` and `b` as input and checks if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word by appending the second string to itself and then checking if it's a substring in the first string. The function checks the rotations of the second word in the first word and returns a boolean value accordingly. If the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This problem can be solved in many other ways, such as:
- **Using **any()** and **itertools.chain**:** The any() function lets you test if any element in a container is true, and the chain() function creates an iterable of elements from the various containers. Here's how you can do it:
```python
import itertools

def cycpattern_check(a, b):
    return any(b in itertools.chain([a, a[::-1]], a[1:]) for _ in range(len(b)))
```

- **Using **str.translate()** and **str.maketrans()**: The `str.translate()` method is a powerful method in Python for replacing characters in a string, and `str.maketrans()` allows you to create a translation table for characters. Here's how you can use them for this problem:
```python
def cycpattern_check(a, b):
    trans = str.maketrans(b, b + b)
    return b in str.translate(a, trans)
``` 

These are just a few examples of solving this problem. Each approach has its own advantages and particularities. You can choose the one you prefer or the one that suits your liking.
