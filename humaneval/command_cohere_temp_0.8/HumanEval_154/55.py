```python
def cycpattern_check(word1, word2):
    rotations = [word2[i:] + word2[:i] for i in range(len(word2))]
    return any(word2 in word1 or rotation in word1 for rotation in rotations)
```

The function `cycpattern_check` uses a list comprehension to generate all possible rotations of the second word and then uses an `any` function to check if any of the rotations (or the second word itself) are substring occurrences in the first word. The function returns `True` if any of the conditions are true and `False` otherwise. 

This solution allows the function to efficiently determine if the second word shares a cyclic pattern with any substring of the first word without explicitly needing to compare all potential substrings of the first word with the second word. 

This approach helps achieve a linear time complexity of `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the longest input word, as opposed to a worst-case time complexity of `O(n^2)` that a brute-force approach with explicit concatenation and substring checking would have. 

The tests passed indicate that the function accurately determines if the second word or any of its rotations share a cyclic pattern with any substring of the first word.
