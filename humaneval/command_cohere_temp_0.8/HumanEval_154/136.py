```python
def cycpattern_check(word1, word2):
    word1 = word1 + word1
    return word2 in word1
```

The function constructs a string `word1 + word1` which is essentially the concatenation of the first word with itself. 

Then it returns `word2 in word1` which would tell us if the second word or any of its rotations are substring in the first word.

This approach makes use of the primitive built-in operations therefore guaranteeing a straightforward and efficient solution. 

This solution should be able to handle almost all cases efficiently and effectively.
