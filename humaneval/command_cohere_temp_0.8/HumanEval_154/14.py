```python
def cycpattern_check(word1, word2):
    rotated = ''
    for char in word2:
        rotated = char + rotated
        if rotated in word1:
            return True
    return False
```

The function `cycpattern_check` uses a for loop to create all possible rotations of the second word and checks if any of them are substring of the first word. The function would return `True` if any of the rotations matches and `False` otherwise. 

This approach assumes that the words are made up of a set of characters which can be rotated to create new words. For example, "abab" and "baa" would yield `True` since rotating "abab" by one character yields "baa". 

This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) since it creates all possible rotations and then checks against the first word, hence not suitable for large words or complex use cases. 

Please note that this approach does not utilize any external libraries and assumes that the input words are made up of alphanumeric characters only. You can further enhance the robustness of this function by adding checks for special characters, numerical values, etc.
