```python
def cycpattern_check(word1, word2):
    rotated = ''
    for char in word2:
        rotated = char + rotated
        if rotated in word1: return True
    return False
```

This function uses the rotation approach where it combines each character of the second word with the already constructed rotated string and checks if the newly constructed rotated string is a substring in the first word. 

The function returns True if any rotation of the second word is a substring in the first word, and False otherwise. 

This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) because it checks all possible rotations of the second word against the first word, which makes it less efficient for large inputs.

The expected way to call the function is by passing 2 strings as arguments like the following:
```python
print(cycpattern_check("abcd", "abd")) # Output: False
print(cycpattern_check("hello", "ell")) # Output: True
print(cycpattern_check("whassup", "psus")) # Output: False
print(cycpattern_check("abab", "baa")) # Output: True
print(cycpattern_check("efef", "eeff")) # Output: False
print(cycpattern_check("himenss", "simen")) # Output: True
``` 

The input [abcd, abd]  would yield False since the rotated string abd is not present in the first string. The second test will yield True since one of the rotations of the string ell is present in the word hello. For the third test, the rotated string psus is not present in the word whassup, so it will yield False. Finally, tests four and five will yield True since the rotated strings, baa and simen, are present in the words abab and himenss respectively.
