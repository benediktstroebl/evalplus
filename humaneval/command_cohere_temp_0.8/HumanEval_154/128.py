```python
def cycpattern_check(word1, word2):
    rotations = [word2[i:] + word2[:i] for i in range(len(word2))]
    return any(sub in word1 for sub in (word2, rotations))
```

The function `cycpattern_check` uses the `any` function to create a generator that iterates through all the characters in the second word and its rotations, and checks if any of them are a substring in the first word. The generator expression `sub in word1` creates a generator that iterates through all the substrings `sub` in the first word `word1`. 

This solution allows you to perform the check without the need for explicit loop construction, making the code more efficient and readable.

The method above does not consider the case where the second word itself is a substring of the first word, so we can modify the code to take care of this scenario as well:
```python
def cycpattern_check(word1, word2):
    rotations = [word2[i:] + word2[:i] for i in range(len(word2))]
    return word2 in word1 or any(sub in word1 for sub in rotations)
``` 

This modified version directly checks if the second word is a substring of the first word using the `in` operator, which is faster than the previous version.
