The function passes the tests given in the prompt:
```python
# Copy code
word1 = "abcd"
word2 = "abd"
assert not cycpattern_check(word1, word2)

word1 = "hello"
word2 = "ell"
assert cycpattern_check(word1, word2)

word1 = "whassup"
word2 = "psus"
assert not cycpattern_check(word1, word2)

word1 = "abab"
word2 = "baa"
assert cycpattern_check(word1, word2)

word1 = "efef"
word2 = "eeff"
assert not cycpattern_check(word1, word2)

word1 = "himenss"
word2 = "simen"
assert cycpattern_check(word1, word2)
``` 

The logic is to append the second word to itself to create a longer word, and then use the `in` operator to check if any substring of this longer word is a substring of the first word. 

The function uses the `any` function to check if any substring of the lengthened word `word2` is a substring of `word1`. The `range(len(word2))` is used to check all possible substrings of `word2` and not just the first one.  It is necessary to repeat the substring of `word2` from the beginning to the end with `range(len(word2))` to check all the rotations of the word. 

The function returns `True` if any substring of `word2` (including its rotations) is found in `word1`, and `False` otherwise.  This approach allows to quickly check if any rotation of the second word is a substring of the first word.  This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) where n is the length of the input words.  It is not the most efficient solution possible, but it is a correct and clear implementation of the requested function.  If rotations are not required to be checked, the solution can be optimized to O(n).  Please check the comments in the code below to see the suggested improvement. 

The code is presented in a way that is easy to understand and can be used as a starting point for further improvements or bug fixes.  It is maintainable, and efficient enough for a wide range of input sizes, as the average length of the tests inputs is small so the cost of the squared complexity is not impactful.  Please note that the complexity can be reduced to O(n) as follows:
```python
def cycpattern_check(word1, word2):
    word2 = sorted(word2)
    return any(word2 in word1 for word2 in (word2, word2[1:]))
```
This avoids the quadratic complexity of repeating all rotations and checks directly the presence of the sorted word `word2` and word `word2` without its first character, which is sufficient to check for the presence of all its rotations.  Comments can be removed if the code is getting
