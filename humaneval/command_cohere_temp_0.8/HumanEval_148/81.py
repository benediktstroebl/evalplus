```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
    p1 = planets.index(planet1)
    p2 = planets.index(planet2)
    
    if p1 == -1 or p2 == -1:
        return ()
    
    result = []
    for planet in planets[p1 <= p2]:
        if planet != planet1 and planet != planet2:
            result.append(planet)
    
    return tuple(result)
```

The function first collects the indices of the given planets in the list of planets in the solar system. The list is sorted by the proximity to the Sun, which means that we can use the `<=` operator to find all planets between the two given planets. Finally, the function selects the planets that are not the input planets and returns them in the form of a tuple. 

The test examples provided in the problem statement are included in the following code snippet: 
```python
def test_bf():
    assert bf("Jupiter", "Neptune") == ("Saturn", "Uranus")
    assert bf("Earth", "Mercury") == ("Venus")
    assert bf("Mercury", "Uranus") == ("Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn")
    assert bf("Green", "Neptune") == ()
    assert bf("Uranus", "Saturn") == ("Jupiter", "Mars", "Earth", "Venus")

test_bf()
```

The code also creates a test that checks if the function correctly processes inputs for which neither of the given planets is present in the solar system: `bf("Green", "Neptune") == ()`. In that case, the function should return an empty tuple. In the code above, the test suite is executed to verify that the function `bf` works as expected.  It would be best if you ran the code to see the results of these tests.
