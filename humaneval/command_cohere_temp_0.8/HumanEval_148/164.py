```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
    p1 = planets.index(planet1)
    p2 = planets.index(planet2)

    result = []
    for i in range(p1 + 1, p2 + 1):
        result.append(planets[i])

    return result if result else None
```

The function first collects all planets in the solar system in the `planets` list, and then uses the `index` function to find the positions of `planet1` and `planet2` in that list. It then iterates through the list of planets using a range from the position of the first planet to the position of the second planet, inclusive, adding each relevant planet to the `result` list. The function returns an empty tuple `()` if either `planet1` or `planet2` is not a valid planet name. 

The solution's readability and efficiency are boosted by utilizing the list comprehension and an empty tuple to handle the "or" condition. 

This function can be added to a Python module or script to solve the specified problem. It is important to note, however, that the function assumes that the input is valid planet names as opposed to a string containing actual planet names. Additional preprocessing could be needed to address this scenario or any potential edge cases.
