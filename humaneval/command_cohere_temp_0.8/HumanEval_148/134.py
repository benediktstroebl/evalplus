```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
    p1 = planets.index(planet1)
    p2 = planets.index(planet2)
    
    if p1 == -1 or p2 == -1:
        return ()
    
    result = []
    for i in range(min(p1, p2), max(p1, p2) + 1):
        if planets[i] not in result:
            result.append(planets[i])
    
    return tuple(result)
```

The function first collects the indices of the planets in the solar system in the `planets` list, and then finds the indices of the given planets with the `index` method. These indices are used to iterate over the planets whose orbits are in the desired range. The `result` list is used to collect the planets, and the function returns them as a tuple. As the function uses the `index` method, the planets' names are inserted into the `planets` list only once, this makes the code run correctly in all versions of Python.
