```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
    p1, p2 = -1, -1
    for i, p in enumerate(planets):
        if p == planet1: p1 = i
        if p == planet2: p2 = i
    if p1 == -1 or p2 == -1: return ()
    return (planets[p1:p2+1])
```

The function first collects the indices of the planets' names and verifies that `planet1` and `planet2` are valid, and their indices are set accordingly. Then the function slices the `planets` array from the index of `planet1` to the index of `planet2` to include all the planets in this segment of the solar system. If `planet1` or `planet2` is incorrect, an empty tuple is returned.
