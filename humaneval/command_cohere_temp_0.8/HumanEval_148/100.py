```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
    p1 = planet1.lower() if planet1 in planets else None
    p2 = planet2.lower() if planet2 in planets else None
    
    if p1 and p2:
        result = []
        for planet in planets:
            if planet == p2 and planet != p1:
                break
            if planet == p1:
                continue
            result.append(planet)
        return result
    else:
        return tuple()
```

The function first creates a list of all planets, and then checks if `planet1` and `planet2` are valid. If they are, it iterates through the list of planets, adding planets to `result` until it encounters a planet that matches `planet2`, or the beginning of the list is reached, because `planet1` is the closest to the sun. The function returns an empty tuple if any of the inputs are invalid. 

The code structure allows for a straightforward implementation of the nested loops, and the checks for invalid inputs and correctness nearer to the code's purpose, for easier comprehension. 

This code assumes that the input will be strings representing the names of the planets. 

To use this script, add a test suite with a list of tests, each containing a pair of strings that represent the `planet1` and `planet2` values. Here is an example:
```python
test_bf = [
    ("Jupiter", "Neptune"),
    ("Earth", "Mercury"),
    ("Mercury", "Uranus"),
]

for test in test_bf:
    assert bf(*test) == bf.description(*test)
```

This will assert that each function call yields the expected result based on the problem description. 

Note: the `bf.description()` is a helper function which returns the expected result of a test based on the problem description.  It is not necessary to have this function in your code, but it is useful for making the tests more readable, by avoiding the need to compute the expected results in a string format. Here is how it could be implemented: 
```python
def bf_description(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
    p1 = planet1.lower() if planet1 in planets else None
    p2 = planet2.lower() if planet2 in planets else None
    
    if p1 is None or p2 is None:
        return tuple()
    if p1 == p2:
        return ()
    result = []
    for planet in planets:
        if planet == p2 and planet != p1:
            break
        if planet == p1:
            continue
        result.append(planet)
    return result
``` 

This could be used in the test suite as: 
```python
test_bf = [
    ("Jupiter", "Neptune"),
    ("Earth", "Mercury"),
    ("Mercury", "Uranus"),
]

for test in test_bf:
    assert bf(*test) == bf.description(*test)
``` 
This will have the same effect as the original code, but makes the expected results more readable.
