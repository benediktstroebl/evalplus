```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
    p1, p2 = -1, -1
    for i, cur_planet in enumerate(planets):
        if cur_planet == planet1: p1 = i
        if cur_planet == planet2: p2 = i
    if p1 == -1 or p2 == -1: return ()
    return (planets[p2], planets[p2+1:p1])
```

The function first collects the indices of the planets to make sure the planets are correctly recognized. Then, it returns the planets located in the orbits between the two planets sorted by the proximity to the sun.
