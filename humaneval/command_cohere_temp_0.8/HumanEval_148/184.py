The function employs a list of planets and their corresponding indices to iterate over the planets and return the relevant ones. Note that the indices are zero-based and specifically assigned to each planet, allowing for a more straightforward determination of the planets within the solar system. The function returns an empty tuple if either of the provided planet names is incorrect or if planet1's orbit is further from the sun than planet2's. Additionally, the base indices and 4 added to p2 ensure that the orbits closest to the sun and planet2 are appropriately included in the resulting tuple.
