```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
    p1 = None
    p2 = None
    idx1 = None
    idx2 = None
   
    # first lets find the indices of the planets in the list
    for i in range(len(planets)):
        if planets[i] == planet1:
            p1 = i
        if planets[i] == planet2:
            p2 = i
    
    # now check if the planets are valid and return an empty tuple if false
    if p1 is None or p2 is None:
        return ()
    
    # we got here, so we assume that both planets are valid
    # so now we calculate the difference between the indices
    # and sort the planets accordingly
    idx1 = p1
    idx2 = p2
    if p1 > p2:
        idx1, idx2 = p2, p1
    planets = sorted(planets)[idx1:idx2+1]
    return tuple(planets)
```

The function first checks if the given planets are valid. If not, it returns an empty tuple. If the planets are valid, it finds the indices of the planets in the solar system list. If the first planet is after the second planet, it swaps the indices to ensure the correct sorting order. It then slices the planet list between the two indices and returns the result as a tuple.
