```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
    p1, p2 = -1, -1
    for i, pole in enumerate(planets):
        if pole == planet1:
            p1 = i
        if pole == planet2:
            p2 = i
    if p1 == -1 or p2 == -1:
        return ()
    return (planets[p1:p2+1])
```
The provided code defines a function called `bf` which takes two parameters, `planet1` and `planet2`. This function returns a tuple containing all planets whose orbits are located between the orbit of `planet1` and the orbit of `planet2`, sorted by proximity to the sun. 

The function first creates a list of all planets and then finds the indices of the `planet1` and `planet2` in this list. In this way, it determines the order of proximity to the sun. Then, if any of the parameters is not a correct planet name, that is, its index is -1, the function returns an empty tuple. Otherwise, it returns a slice of the list of planets closed with the indices `p1` and `p2`, which contains all planets whose orbits are between the orbit of `planet1` and `planet2`.
