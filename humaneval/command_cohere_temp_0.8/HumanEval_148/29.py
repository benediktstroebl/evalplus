```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
    p1, p2 = -1, -1
    for i, pi in enumerate(planets):
        if pi == planet1: p1 = i
        if pi == planet2: p2 = i
    if p1 == -1 or p2 == -1: return ()
    return (planets[p2] if p2 < p1 else planets[p1:p2+1])
```

The function first collects the indices of `planet1` and `planet2` in the `planets` list, taking care not to repeat the planet names more than once. If any of the planets is not found in the list, the function returns an empty tuple. Otherwise, it returns all the planets in the list of planets sorted by their proximity to the sun. The function takes into account that the list is already sorted by the proximity to the sun, and returns the planets in the correct order.
