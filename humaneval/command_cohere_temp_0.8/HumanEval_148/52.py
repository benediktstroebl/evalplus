```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
    p1, p2 = -1, -1
    for i, pole in enumerate(planets):
        if pole == planet1: p1 = i
        if pole == planet2: p2 = i
    if p1 == -1 or p2 == -1: return ()
    return (planets[(p2 + 1) % 8], planets[((p1 - 1) + 8) % 8])
```
The function first stores the planets in the solar system in the `planets` array. Then, it checks if the values of `planet1` and `planet2` are correct, and returns an empty tuple if at least one of them is incorrect. Finally, it uses two pointers on the `planets` array to retrieve the planets whose orbits are between the orbits of `planet1` and `planet2`, and returns a tuple with the planets sorted by their proximity to the sun.
