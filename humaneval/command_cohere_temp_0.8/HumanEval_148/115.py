```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
    p1, p2 = -1, -1
    for i, cur_planet in enumerate(planets):
        if cur_planet == planet1: p1 = i
        if cur_planet == planet2: p2 = i
    if p1 == -1 or p2 == -1: return ()
    return (planets[p2], planets[p2+1:p1])
```

The function first collects the indices of the planets in the solar system. Then, it checks if the provided planets are correct and returns an empty tuple if at least one of them is incorrect. Finally, it returns all the planets located between the two given planets, including the closest planet to the sun and excluding the furthest planet from the sun due to the indexing range. The resulting list of planets is then returned, properly sorted by proximity to the sun. 

The following test cases would pass this function:
```python
>>> bf("Jupiter", "Neptune")
('Saturn', 'Uranus')

>>> bf("Earth", "Mercury")
('Venus')

>>> bf("Mercury", "Uranus")
('Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn')
```
