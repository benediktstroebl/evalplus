```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
    p1, p2 = -1, -1
    for i, pi in enumerate(planets):
        if pi == planet1: p1 = i
        if pi == planet2: p2 = i
    if p1 == -1 or p2 == -1: return ()
    return (planets[p2] if p2 < p1 else planets[p1:p2+1])
```

The function first stores the names of the eight planets in the `planets` list. It then searches for the indices of the planets' names in the list using the `enumerate` function, storing `-1` if the planet name is not found. If either of the input planets is not found, an empty tuple is returned. If both planets are found, the function returns a tuple of all planets within the range defined by the indices `p1` and `p2`, sorted by proximity to the sun. The function uses a ternary operator to return either all planets from `p2` to `p1` or a slice of the `planets` list from index `p1` to `p2` exclusive, based on the comparison of `p2` to `p1`.
