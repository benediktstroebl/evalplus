```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
    p1, p2 = -1, -1
    for i, cur_planet in enumerate(planets):
        if cur_planet == planet1:
            p1 = i
        if cur_planet == planet2:
            p2 = i
    res = []
    if 0 <= p1 < p2:
        for i in range(p1 + 1, p2 + 1):
            res.append(planets[i])
    elif p2 < p1 <= 7:
        for i in range(p2 + 1, p1 + 1):
            res.append(planets[i])
    return res if res else ()
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `bf` that takes two arguments, `planet1` and `planet2`, and aims to return a tuple containing all planets whose orbits are located between the orbit of `planet1` and the orbit of `planet2`. The function sorts the planets by their proximity to the sun and excludes invalid planet names.

Here's a concise summary of the function's logic:
1. The function initially constructs an ` enumerate()` loop to retrieve the indices `i` of each planet in the `planets` list.
2. The `p1` and `p2` variables are assigned the indices of `planet1` and `planet2`, respectively.
3. Using the indices, the function determines whether `planet1` is closer to the sun than `planet2` (`0 <= p1 < p2`) or vice versa (`p2 < p1 <= 7`).
4. Depending on the relative positions of the provided planets, the function constructs a list `res` containing all relevant planets.
5. Finally, an empty tuple is returned if no valid planets are found (`res == `[]).

This approach enables the function to accurately provide the desired planets, considering their relative positions and sorting them by solar proximity.
