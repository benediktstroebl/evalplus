```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
    p1 = planets.index(planet1)
    p2 = planets.index(planet2)
    
    if p1 == -1 or p2 == -1:
        return ()
    
    result = []
    for i in range(max(p1, p2), min(p1, p2), -1):
        if i >= 0 and i < len(planets):
            result.append(planets[i])
    
    return tuple(result)
```

The function first collects all relevant planets into the `result` list, and then converts this list to a tuple to conform to the problem statement requirements. The `planets` list contains all planet names, sorted by proximity to the sun. The `p1` and `p2` variables are used to set the initial and final indices for filtering the `planets` list. The code then checks if the provided inputs are valid planet names using the `index()` method and handles the edge case where planet1 and planet2 are the same. Finally, the `result` list is filtered against the indices of the `planets` list to collect all relevant planets, respecting the order close to the sun. 

The following test suite was generated by the problem statement:
```python
test_bf = {
    "test_bf_valid": (
        "@pytest.mark.parametrize('planet1, planet2, expected', [("Jupiter", "Neptune", ("Saturn", "Uranus")), ("Earth", "Mercury", ("Venus")), ("Mercury", "Uranus", ("Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn"))]),
    "test_bf_invalid": (
        "@pytest.mark.parametrize('planet1, planet2', [(None, "Neptune"), ("Earth", None), ("Saturn", "Saturn")])",
    "test_bf_edgecases": (
        "@pytest.mark.parametrize('planet1, planet2, expected', [("Venus", "Venus", ()), ("Mars", "Venus", ("Venus")), ("Uranus", "Neptune", ("Saturn", "Uranus"))])
}
``` 
The test suite contains 3 test functions: 
 - `test_bf_valid` â€” This function checks examples from the problem statement. 
 - `test_bf_invalid` â€” This function checks edge cases with invalid inputs. 
 - `test_bf_edgecases` â€” This function checks edge cases of the function. 

To run this test suite, you can use the following command:
```bash
python -m pytest -sv
``` 
This will execute the test suite and show a detailed summary of the test results, including any failed tests, assertions, and error details. 

To include the code and the test suite in a Jupyter notebook, ensure you have the **pytest** and **pytest-notebook** plugins installed. You can execute the cell with the following command:
```python
!\npip install pytest pytest-notebook
``` 
Then, you can insert the code and the corresponding test suite into a cell, starting with the command `%;`. 
Finally, run the cell with the command `%run -p pytest` and it will automatically run the test suite. 
Any assertion errors or failures will be highlighted in the notebook at the point of
