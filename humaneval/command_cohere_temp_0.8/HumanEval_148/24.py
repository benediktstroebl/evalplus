```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
    p1, p2 = -1, -1
    for i, cur_planet in enumerate(planets):
        if cur_planet == planet1: p1 = i
        if cur_planet == planet2: p2 = i
    if p1 == -1 or p2 == -1: return ()
    return (planets[p1:p2+1])
```

The function first collects the indices of the planets to return a more efficient solution. If any of the planets is not found, an empty tuple is returned. Otherwise, it returns the planets located in the orbital path between the two planets as strings in ascending order.
