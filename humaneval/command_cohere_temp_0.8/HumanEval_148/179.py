```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
    p1 = planets.index(planet1)
    p2 = planets.index(planet2)
    
    result = []
    for i in range(p1, p2 + 1):
        result.append(planets[i])
        
    return result if result != [] else None
```

The function first collects all planets in the solar system in the `planets` list, and then uses the Python 3+ style of indexing to find the indices of `planet1` and `planet2`. It then iterates through the indices to collect all planets whose indices are between the two, and closer to the first index (as there's no direct method in Python to directly iterate through indices like this). The resulting list is returned, or an empty list/tuple if invalid inputs are provided. 

This approach enables a concise and readable solution, which follows Python's PEP 8 code-styling guidelines. 

The `None` return is used, as this is a valid answer to the question, and serves as an empty tuple alternative.
