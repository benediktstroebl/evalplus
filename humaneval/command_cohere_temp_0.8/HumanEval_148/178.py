            l.append(planets[p1])
            p1 += 1
        elif p1 <= 5 and p2 >= 7:

The function `bf` performs the following steps:
1. Store the planets list in the planets variable to allow easier access.
2. Initialize `p1` and `p2` to `None` to indicate that the initial positions of the planets are not yet determined.
3. Loop through the planets using `enumerate` to assign the position numbers to the planets and determine the `p1` and `p2` positions.
4. If `p1` or `p2` is `None`, return an empty tuple because either input planet is not a correct planet name.
5. Initialize an empty list `l` to store the planets to be returned.
6. Enter the loop twice guarded by `p1 <= p2` and `p1 <= 6 && p2 >= 6` to handle the edge cases correctly.
7. Append the planet at position `p1` to the list `l` and increment `p1` unless it already equals `p2`.
8. If the previous point's condition is met, it means we've reached the correct loop condition, and the planets at position `p1` and `p2` are the same, so we only append the planet at position `p1`.
9. After the previous loop, handle the case where `p1` is incremented one more time so that we don't miss the planets nearby `p2`.
10. Return the list `l` as a tuple after the loop.
