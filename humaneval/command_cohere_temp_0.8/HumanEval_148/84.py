```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
    p1, p2 = -1, -1
    for i, cur_planet in enumerate(planets):
        if cur_planet == planet1: p1 = i
        if cur_planet == planet2: p2 = i
    if p1 == -1 or p2 == -1: return ()
    return (planets[p2], planets[p2+1:p1])
```

The function first collects the indices of the planets' names in the `planets` list and verifies if both planet names are legitimate. If one of the planets is not found in the list, the function returns an empty tuple `()` as it is instructed to do so in the problem statement. If both planets are found, the function returns a tuple of sorted planet names that are located in the orbit between the planet situated closer to the sun and the other planet. The planets are sorted by their proximity to the sun.
