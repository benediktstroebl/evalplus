```

The provided Python script defines a function called `bf` that performs a check on a given pair of planets (`planet1` and `planet2`) and returns a tuple containing all the planets whose orbits are located between the orbit of `planet1` and `planet2`. The function utilizes a list containing all the planets and some logic to determine the correct order. The function returns an empty tuple if either of the input planet names is incorrect, and considers only the proximity to the sun for sorting. 

The script passes the test cases provided in the prompt, including edge cases, and provides a logical implementation of the beamforming technique.
