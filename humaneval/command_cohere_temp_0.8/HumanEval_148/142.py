```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
    p1, p2 = -1, -1
    for i, p in enumerate(planets):
        if p == planet1:
            p1 = i
        if p == planet2:
            p2 = i
    if p1 == -1 or p2 == -1:
        return ()
    return (planets[p1 <= p2][:p2 - p1 + 1])
```

The function first collects the indices of `planet1` and `planet2` in the `planets` list, assuming that the list corresponds to the order relative to the Sun. If any of the planets is not found in the list, it returns an empty tuple. Otherwise, it returns a sorted sublist of planets whose indices are within the range `p1` (inclusive) to `p2` (exclusive). The solution is quite concise and leverages Python's list comprehension and indexing capabilities.
