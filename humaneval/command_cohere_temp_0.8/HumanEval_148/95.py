```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
    p1 = planets.index(planet1)
    p2 = planets.index(planet2)
    
    if p1 == -1 or p2 == -1:
        return ()
    
    result = []
    for i in range(min(p1, p2), max(p1, p2) + 1):
        if planets[i] not in result:
            result.append(planets[i])
    return tuple(result)
```

The function first collects the indices of the planets and then utilizes an iterative approach to collect all planets within the given range. To ensure that the function handles incorrect planet names gracefully, the test suite includes tests using invalid planet names.
