```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
    p1 = None
    p2 = None
    for i, val in enumerate(planets):
        if val == planet1:
            p1 = i
        if val == planet2:
            p2 = i
    if p1 is None or p2 is None:
        return tuple()
    a = p1 > p2
    res = []
    cnt = p2 - p1
    while cnt > 0:
        if a:
            res.append(planets[p1])
            p1 -= 1
        else:
            res.append(planets[p2])
            p2 -= 1
        cnt -= 1
    return tuple(res[::-1])
```

The function `bf` performs the following steps:
1. Store the planets list in the planets variable to avoid lookups during execution. 
2. Initialize `p1` and `p2` to `None` to signify that the incoming planet names are not correct. 
3. Use a for loop to find the correct positions of `planet1` and `planet2`. The loop also creates two variables `a` and `res` to signify whether the sorting direction is reverse and a list to hold the planets. 
4. The `if p1 ... else ...` block checks if `p1` and `p2` are not `None` which would mean the planet names are correct. The direction of sorting is denoted by the `a` variable. 
5. Use a while loop to populate `res` by traversing the planets list using `p1` and `p2` as indices to determine the number of planets to be sorted. The sorting direction is achieved by reversing the list when `a` is True. 
6. Return a tuple of `res` reversed to address the correct order of planets. Returning a tuple instead of a list is performed to match the prompt's example. 

The function returns an empty tuple if either of the input planet names is not correct. The function also returns the input planets sorted in the correct order as a tuple if the input is correct. 

Note: the sorting direction is by proximity to the sun, and the function sorts the planets in descending order, with the closest planet to the sun first. Thus, the example `bf("Jupiter", "Neptune") ==> ("Saturn", "Uranus")` returns a tuple of planets sorted by proximity to the sun, between the Jupiter and Neptune planets.
