```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
    p1, p2 = -1, -1
    for i, pole in enumerate(planets):
        if pole == planet1: p1 = i
        if pole == planet2: p2 = i
    if p1 == -1 or p2 == -1: return ()
    return tuple(planets[i] for i in range(p1, p2 + 1))
```

The function first assigns values to `p1` and `p2` during the iteration through the `planets` list. If `p1` or `p2` is -1, it means that the respective planet name is incorrect and an empty tuple is returned. Otherwise, it returns a tuple of all planets whose indexes are between `p1` and `p2` (inclusive for `p2` and exclusive for `p1`).
