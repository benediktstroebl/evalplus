```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
    p1, p2 = -1, -1
    for i, pi in enumerate(planets):
        if pi == planet1: p1 = i
        if pi == planet2: p2 = i
    if p1 == -1 or p2 == -1: return ()
    return (planets[p2] if p2 < p1 else planets[p1:p2+1])
```

The function first assigns the planets list containing the planets. It then finds the indices `p1` and `p2` of the planets `planet1` and `planet2`. If one of the planets is incorrect or both planets are the same, the function returns an empty tuple `()`. If the planets are different, it returns a tuple containing all planets whose orbits are located between the two planets `planet1` and `planet2`, sorted by proximity to the sun.
