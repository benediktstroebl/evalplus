```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
    p1 = planets.index(planet1)
    p2 = planets.index(planet2)
    
    if p1 == -1 or p2 == -1:
        return ()
    
    return tuple(planets[p1:p2+1])
```

The function `bf` takes two parameters, `planet1` and `planet2`, representing the names of two planets. It uses the list `planets` to store all the planet names and determines the indices of `planet1` and `planet2` in this list using the `index` function. If either of the indices is -1, indicating that the planet name is not found in the list, the function returns an empty tuple `()`. This is done to handle incorrect inputs.

The function then returns a tuple containing all the planets whose indices are within the range of `p1` to `p2` (inclusive), meaning their orbits are between the orbits of `planet1` and `planet2`. The planets are sorted by their proximity to the sun, as per the task description.

The provided example inputs and outputs demonstrate the correct behavior of the function.
