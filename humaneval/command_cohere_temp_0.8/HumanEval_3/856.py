```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each operation in the input list. It accumulates the balance as it would in a real-world scenario. If at any point the balance falls below 0 (indicating a deficit), it immediately returns `True`. If no such negative balance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of the loop, indicating that the balance never fell below zero. 

This solution follows the given test examples provided in the prompt and should correctly solve the problem.
