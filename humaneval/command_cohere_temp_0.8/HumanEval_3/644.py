```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation represents a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money). The function initializes a variable `balance` to 0, and iterates through each operation in the input list. It accumulates the total value of deposits and withdrawals in the `balance` variable. If at any point the balance falls below 0 (indicating a negative balance), it immediately returns `True`. If no negative balance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end. 

This solution follows the given test examples provided in the problem context:
- With a list of deposit-only operations `[1, 2, 3]`, it returns `False` since the balance never falls below zero. 
- With a list of operations `[1, 2, -4, 5]`, it returns `True` since the account balance falls below zero after the third operation, despite eventually rising back above zero. 
This function is deterministic and uses a constant amount of memory proportional to the size of the `operations` list.
