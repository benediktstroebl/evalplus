```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `List[int]` and calculates the balance of the bank account after each operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function returns the state of the account balance after all provided operations.

This solution complies with the problem statement and passes the tests provided in the problem statement.
