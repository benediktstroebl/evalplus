```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point in the operations or `False` otherwise. It does so by iterating through each operation in the input list and accumulating the balance while keeping track of whether it dips into negative values. The function returns `True` if the balance falls below zero at any point during this iteration, and `False` otherwise. 

This approach ensures that the function leverages Python's strong typing and functional capabilities, achieves the core purpose, and does so within a self-contained code block. 

This function would successfully pass both test cases mentioned in the problem prompt and would handle the essence of the described task.
