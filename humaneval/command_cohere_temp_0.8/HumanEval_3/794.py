```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The task is to determine whether the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

The function sets the initial balance to zero and then iterates through each element in the `operations` list. It updates the balance by adding the value of each operation (deposit or withdrawal) to the current balance. After each operation, it checks if the balance has fallen below zero. If it does, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the balance fell below zero at least once during the sequence of operations. If the loop completes without the balance ever falling below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the balance remained non-negative throughout the sequence.

The function utilizes Python's typing module to indicate the expected input type, which is a list of integers, and the return value is of type `bool`.

This solution is efficient because it uses a single loop to process the operations and accumulates the balance locally, avoiding any unnecessary recursion or complex data structures. This makes it an efficient solution for the problem that falls within the acceptable time and space complexity for this type of task.
