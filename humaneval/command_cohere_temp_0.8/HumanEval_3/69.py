```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It calculates the balance by summing up the operations, then checks if it goes negative at any point, and returns `True` if it does, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This example corresponds to the test cases provided in the problem statement. One example tests demonstrates a scenario where the balance falls below zero, and the other example tests demonstrates a scenario where the balance remains non-negative. 
The function `below_zero` is designed to follow the problem statement and provide the appropriate output for the given test cases, offering a standalone solution for this particular problem.
