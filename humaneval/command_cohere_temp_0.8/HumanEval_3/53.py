```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each value in the input list. It simulates a bank account where each value in the input list could be a deposit or withdrawal operation (positive or negative integer). It keeps a running balance and checks whether the balance ever falls below zero. If it finds any such instance, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`.

This solution follows the exact specification given in the problem statement and should produce the correct output for the test cases provided.
