```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and tests if any point the balance of operations falls below zero. It uses a simple loop to iterate through each operation in the list, adding them to the balance. If the balance falls below zero at any point, it returns True, if it finishes the loop and the balance is still zero, it returns False. This behaves as expected with the provided test cases in the prompt.
