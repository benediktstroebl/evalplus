```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates them into a running balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went negative at some point. If no negative balance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of the loop when all operations are processed. 

This solution is concise and directly iterates through the operations to determine if the balance falls below zero at any point. It effectively demonstrates the proper behavior described in the prompt.
