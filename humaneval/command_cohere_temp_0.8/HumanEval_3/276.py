```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of a bank account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after executing all the given deposit and withdrawal operations. It does so by iterating through each element in the input list of operations, summing them to the current balance of the account, and then checking if any of these operations would result in a negative balance.

Here is an example usage of this function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

In the first example above, the function returns `False` because the list of operations `[1, 2, 3]` does not cause the account balance to fall below zero. In the second example, the function returns `True` because the list of operations `[1, 2, -4, 5]` causes the account balance to fall below zero after the second operation, since 2 is added to the balance and then -4 is subtracted, resulting in a balance of -2, which is less than 0.
