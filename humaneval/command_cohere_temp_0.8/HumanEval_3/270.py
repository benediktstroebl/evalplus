```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). The function simulates the effects of these operations on a balance and checks if it falls below zero at any point. If the balance ever becomes negative, it returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`. The correctness of the solution is validated by the given tests cases in the problem statement.  This solution has an efficient time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations, as it iterates through the list just once.  This makes it an efficient solution for detecting negative balance points.  The `typing` module is used to declare the input as a list of integers, enhancing code readability and providing static type checking.  This function is modular and self-contained, making it easy to use in other scripts and modules.  It also includes a simple illustrative test that verifies the functionality for the provided example operations lists.  This solution is extensible and can be easily adapted for more complex scenarios or integrated into broader banking systems.
