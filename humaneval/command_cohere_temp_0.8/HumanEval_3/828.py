```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, such as deposits and withdrawals, and determine whether the account balance falls below zero at any point.

Here's how the script works:
1. The `below_zero` function resets the account balance to zero at the start of each list of operations.
2. It then iterates through each element, `op`, in the `operations` list.
3. In each iteration, it adds the `op` value to the current balance. This simulates a deposit or withdrawal operation on the account. If `op` is positive, it's interpreted as a deposit; if negative, as a withdrawal.
4. If at any point the calculated `balance` becomes less than zero, it means the account balance has fallen below zero, and the function immediately returns `True`.
5. If the loop completes without the account balance falling below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero during the given operations.

This way, the `below_zero` function accurately detects if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point in the sequence of operations provided. The script meets the criteria of the problem statement and would pass the provided tests.
