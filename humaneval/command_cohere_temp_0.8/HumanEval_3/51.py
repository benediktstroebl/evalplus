```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It calculates the balance by summing up the operations, then checks if it goes negative at any point, and returns `True` if it does, and `False` otherwise. The function is tested with examples in the problem statement, and the corresponding tests are defined below:
```python
def test_below_zero():
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
    assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
    assert below_zero([0, 0, 0]) == False
    assert below_zero([-5, -10, -3, -8, -1]) == True
    assert below_zero([-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == False

test_below_zero()
```
