```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, representing deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. It iterates through each operation in the list, updating the account balance by adding or subtracting the operation amount. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If no such instance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations. 

This solution is concise and efficiently determines if the account balance falls below zero at any point during the given operations. 

The `below_zero` function can be tested using the provided examples in the markdown code block, ensuring that it correctly identifies instances where the account balance falls below zero.
