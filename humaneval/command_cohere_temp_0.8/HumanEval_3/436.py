```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function iterates through each operation in the list, updating the balance accordingly. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero. 

This solution is concise and efficient, directly solving the problem statement without any unnecessary complexity. 

This code can be tested directly in the Python environment by calling the function with different lists of operations and verifying the returned results against the problem statement.
