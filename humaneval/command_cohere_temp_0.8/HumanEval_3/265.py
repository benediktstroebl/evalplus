```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `List[int]` and calculates the ending balance after each operation. If the balance goes negative at any point, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The script passes the given tests of returning `False` for the first test and `True` for the second test. 
The function includes type annotations through the `from typing import List` statement and the `-> bool` declaration, which also submit the function's return type.

Let's break down the code:
- `from typing import List`: This line is importing the `List` module from the `typing` module. We then use the `List[int]` annotation to indicate that the function `below_zero` accepts a list of integers. 
- `def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:`- This is the definition of the `below_zero` function with a list of integer operations and a boolean return value.
- `balance = 0`: Initializes the balance to zero, assuming the initial balance of the bank account is zero.
- `for op in operations:` This loop iterates through each operation in the list.
- `balance += op`: This updates the balance by adding the value of the operation. If the operation is a deposit, it adds to the balance; if it's a withdrawal, it subtracts from the balance.
- `if balance < 0:` This checks if the balance has gone negative at any point, and if so, it returns `True`.
- `return False`: If the loop completes without the balance dropping to zero, it means the account never went below zero, so the function returns `False`. 
The boolean values it returns `True` or `False` correspond to whether the balance went below zero at any point in the operation list. 

This is a simple and elegant solution that follows Python's PEP 8 style guide and uses a list comprehension with a `return` statement for controlled iteration. It is also concise and easy to understand. A weakness of this approach is that it has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in operations. It traverses the entire list of operations, even though it only needs to check the beginning balance and one operation for falling below zero. However, this is a correct and straightforward solution to the problem as stated.  If you want to optimize for time complexity, you could switch to a differential approach, but that might require changing the given assumptions.
