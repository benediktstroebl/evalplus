```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The function's purpose is to determine if the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

The function starts by initializing the balance of the account to zero. Then, it iterates through each element in the `operations` list. For each operation, it adds the operation's value to the current balance. If the balance becomes negative during this process, it means the account balance fell below zero at some point, and the function returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance ever falling below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account never fell into a negative balance during the given operations. 

This solution is efficient because it uses a for loop to iterate through the list of operations and updates the balance accordingly. This can be helpful in scenarios where the list of operations is huge and the memory usage is a concern.
