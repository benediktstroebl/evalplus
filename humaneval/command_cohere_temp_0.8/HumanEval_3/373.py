```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function iterates through each operation in the list, updating the balance by adding the value of the operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at some point. If no such instance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations. 

The function is designed to efficiently handle the scenario where the account balance goes negative, and it provides a clear and direct way to determine such instances in a given list of operations. 

This solution relies on the clarity of the problem statement and follows Python's concise and expressive style, making it easily understandable and maintainable.
