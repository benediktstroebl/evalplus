```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script introduces an iterative approach to the solution. It first initializes the balance variable to zero. Then, it iterates through each integer in the input list of operations, adding each value to the balance. If the balance falls below zero at any point, the function immediately returns True. If the entire list is processed without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns False. This solution is concise and efficient, correctly identifying whether the balance falls below zero at any point in the given operations.  This approach drastically improves the efficiency of the solution, making it capable of handling larger inputs more efficiently.
