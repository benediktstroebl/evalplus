```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of a bank account, which starts at zero balance and undergoes a series of deposit and withdrawal operations represented by the input operations, falls below zero at any point.

The function utilizes a simple loop to iterate through each operation in the input list. For each operation, it updates the current balance by adding or subtracting the operation value, representing a deposit or withdrawal respectively.

The key check occurs within the loop: if at any point the updated balance becomes less than zero, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once during the sequence of operations. If the loop completes without the balance ever falling below zero, the function returns `False`, suggesting that the account balance remained non-negative throughout the entire operation sequence.

This approach takes advantage of the simplicity of Python's list comprehension and basic variable manipulation for an efficient and concise solution. The script adheres to best practices in Python with explicit type annotation and descriptive variable names to enhance readability and maintainability.
