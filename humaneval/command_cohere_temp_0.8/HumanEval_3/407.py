```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the input list represents either a deposit (positive integer) or a withdrawal (negative integer). The purpose of this task is to determine if the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

The function sets the initial balance to zero and then iterates through each operation in the input list. For each operation, it updates the balance by adding the value of the operation. If at any point the balance becomes negative (falls below zero), the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the balance went below zero at least once. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, the function returns `False`, meaning the balance never fell below zero throughout the sequence of operations.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations in the input list, as it iterates through each operation once. It is an efficient solution to track the balance and determine if it falls below zero at any point.
