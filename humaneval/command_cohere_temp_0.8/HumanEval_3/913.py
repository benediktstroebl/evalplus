```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates them into a running balance using an initial balance of 0. If at any point the balance falls below 0, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at some point. If no such scenario is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations. 

This solution is concise and directly iterates through the operations to determine if the balance goes negative at any point. It effectively simulates the behavior of a bank account and provides the desired result for the given problem.
