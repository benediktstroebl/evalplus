```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It iterates through each operation in the input list, accumulating a balance variable. If at any point the balance becomes negative, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`. This problem can be solved using a simple loop that iterates through the operations, accumulating the balance, and checking if it goes negative at any point.  This solution is efficient since it has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations in the input list.
