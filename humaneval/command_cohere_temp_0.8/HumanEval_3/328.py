```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point due to those operations, and `False` otherwise. The function iterates through each operation in the input list, accumulates the balance of the account, and checks whether it crosses zero.
