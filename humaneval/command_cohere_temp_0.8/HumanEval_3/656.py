```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each value in the input list. It assumes that each integer represents a deposit or withdrawal operation, where positive integers represent deposits, and negative integers represent withdrawals. It keeps a running balance of these operations and returns `True` if the balance falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. The function returns the appropriate value after processing all the operations. 

Here is an example usage of the script:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This example corresponds to the given examples in the problem statement. The first example asserts that the balance will never go below zero with the given sequence of operations, whereas the second example asserts that the balance will go below zero with the provided sequence of operations.
