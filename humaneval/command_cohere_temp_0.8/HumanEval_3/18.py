```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers named `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of a bank account, which starts at zero balance and undergoes a series of deposit and withdrawal operations represented by the input list, falls below zero at any point.

The function begins by initializing a variable called `balance` to 0, which represents the current balance of the bank account. It then iterates through each element (operation) in the input list using a `for` loop. During each iteration, the function adds the current operation to the `balance` to simulate the effect of that operation on the account balance.

If at any point the computed `balance` becomes less than 0 (indicating a negative balance), the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once during the sequence of operations. If the loop completes without the balance ever falling below zero, the function returns `False`, suggesting that the account balance never went into the negative.

The expected outputs for the given test cases are:
- `below_zero([1, 2, 3])` returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never falls below zero when the input list contains only positive operations.
- `below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])` returns `True`, indicating that the account balance falls below zero due to the negative operation `-4` in the input list.

The function utilizes basic dynamic programming principles, using a single loop to update the balance while checking for the condition of interest, enabling it to efficiently solve the problem without additional complexity.
