```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and determines whether the balance of the bank account will fall below zero at any point. The function updates the balance as if these operations were executed sequentially, and it returns `True` if the balance dips negative at any point, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This passes the test cases provided in the original problem.
