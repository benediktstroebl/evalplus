```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function iterates through each operation in the list, updating the running balance by adding the `op`. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at some point. If none of the operations cause the balance to go below zero, it returns `False` at the end. 

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem statement. It also follows Python's standard style for readable and maintainable code. 

This script can be tested against the test cases mentioned in the problem statement as follows: 
```python
> import unittest
> 
> class TestBelowZero(unittest.TestCase):
>     def test_single_positive_op(self):
>         self.assertFalse(below_zero([1]))
> 
>     def test_single_negative_op(self):
>         self.assertTrue(below_zero([-10]))
> 
>     def test_multiple_ops_with_zero(self):
>         self.assertFalse(below_zero([1, 2, -3, 4, -5, 6]))
> 
>     def test_multiple_ops_with_negative(self):
>         self.assertTrue(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))
> 
> if __name__ == "__main__":
>     unittest.main()
``` 
This will run the tests and report if the function `below_zero` correctly solves the problem.
