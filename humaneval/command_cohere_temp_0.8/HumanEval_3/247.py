```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` on a bank account and returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. It achieves this by iterating through each operation in the list and updating the balance accordingly. If the balance ever becomes negative, the function returns `True`. Additionally, the script includes a docstring with example usage and a test scenario that verifies the function's behavior against expected outcomes.
