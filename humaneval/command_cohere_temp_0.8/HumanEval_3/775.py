```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function iterates through each operation in the list, simulating the effect of each operation on the account balance. It keeps track of the balance as it processes each operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at some point during the operations. If the entire list of operations is processed without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never went below zero. 

The function's behavior is demonstrated through example tests, as shown below: 
```python
# Test cases
assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
assert below_zero([0, 5, -10, 3, -2]) == True
assert below_zero([-5, -10, 0, 7]) == False
``` 

These tests check various scenarios involving different lists of operations, verifying that the function correctly predicts whether the account balance goes below zero or not.  The `assert` statements check the function's output against the expected truthiness (True or False) for the given input operations list. 

The function's docstring also provides informative guidance on the problem statement and the function's expectations, making it a helpful tool for this particular task.
