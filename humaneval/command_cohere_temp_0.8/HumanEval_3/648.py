```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each operation in the list. It accumulates the balance as it iterates through the operations. If at any point the balance falls below 0 (indicating a negative balance), it immediately returns `True`. If none of the operations cause the balance to drop below zero, it returns `False` after processing all the operations.

Here is an example usage of this function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
This would return `False` and `True` respectively, which conforms to the original hypothesis test for this problem. 

The `below_zero` function is straightforward and effective, providing a simple method to determine whether an account balance will dip below zero at any point based on a sequence of operations.
