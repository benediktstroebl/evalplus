```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount). The function iterates through each operation in the list, accumulating the balance of the bank account. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it indicates that the account has become overdrawn, and the function returns `True`. If the balance remains non-negative throughout all the operations, it returns `False`, indicating that the account was never overdrawn during the given operations. 

Here is a simple test to validate the functionality of the function:
```python
def test_below_zero():
    # No negative balance, should return False
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False

    # Negative balance, should return True
    assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True

    # Zero balance once, should return True
    assert below_zero([0, -10, 0, -5]) == True

    # Multiple negative balances, should return True
    assert below_zero([-10, -5, -10, 5, -8, -1]) == True
``` 

To run the tests in the script, you can execute the script file directly in your Python environment. 

This script provides a clear and direct way to solve the problem using a list comprehension and basic Python control statements.  It allows for the easy detection of negative account balances amidst a series of deposit and withdrawal operations.
