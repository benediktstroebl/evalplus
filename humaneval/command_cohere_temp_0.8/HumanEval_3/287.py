```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and determines whether the balance of a bank account, initialized at zero, would fall below zero after executing all the given operations. It iterates through each operation in the input list, summing them to the current balance. If at any point the calculated balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went negative at some point. If all operations are performed without causing a negative balance, it returns `False`. The function is designed to efficiently handle the problem statement and provide the appropriate outcome based on the given operations.  This solution provides a clear and concise implementation of the requested function.
