```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function iterates through the list of operations, updating the running balance by adding each operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, it returns `False`. This solution relies on local state (the balance) within the function, which is a more efficient and scalable approach compared to the global state-based solution. It provides the functionality and fulfills the requirements of the problem statement.
