```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after executing a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. It does so in the following steps:
- The function initialize a variable `balance` to zero, which represents the initial balance of the account. 
- It then iterates through each element in the input list of operations.
- For each operation, it adds the operation value to the current balance. If the operation is a deposit (a positive integer), it adds the amount to the balance, and if it's a withdrawal (a negative integer), it subtracts the amount from the balance.
- If at any point the `balance` falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once during the sequence of operations.
- If the loop completes without the balance ever falling below zero, it returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero during the given operations.

This approach ensures that the function returns `True` if the account balance ever falls below zero, even if it returns `False` if the balance recovers to non-negative values. 

This function is useful for validating that a series of financial operations will not result in a negative balance, providing an important check in financial analytics and banking systems. 

Here are some example inputs and expected outputs as per the original Markdown code block instructions:
```python
# Example 1:
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False

# Example 2:
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 

This Python script provides a functional solution to the problem and passes the tests outlined in the original Markdown code block.
