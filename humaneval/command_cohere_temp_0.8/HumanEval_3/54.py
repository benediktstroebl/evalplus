```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation representing a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money) on a bank account. The function iterates through each operation, updating the running balance and returns `True` if the balance ever falls below zero, indicating that the account is in debt at some point, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This example corresponds to the given test cases. The first test case, `[1, 2, 3]`, implies a series of deposits only, and the account never falls below zero. The second test case, `[1, 2, -4, 5]`, includes a withdrawal of -4, which brings the account balance below zero, hence the function returns `True`.  This coherently demonstrates the behavior of the `below_zero` function in the provided markdown cell.
