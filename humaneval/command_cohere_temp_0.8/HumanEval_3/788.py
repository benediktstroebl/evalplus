```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It calculates the balance by summing up the operations, then iterates through each operation in the list, adding them to the balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero. 

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem statement. 

You can test this script by calling the `below_zero` function with different lists of operations and verifying the returned results against the expected truth values.
