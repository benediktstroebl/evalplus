```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (of type `List[int]`), which represent the sequence of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. The function initializes the balance to 0 and then iterates through each operation in the list.

For each operation, it adds it to the current balance (e.g., if it's a deposit) or subtracts it from the balance (e.g., if it's a withdrawal). If at any point the balance falls below 0 (indicating a negative balance), it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at some point.

If the loop completes without the balance ever going negative, it returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero.

The script passes the given tests of returning `False` for a list of deposit-only operations and returning `True` for a list that includes a withdrawal that brings the account balance below zero. 

Please note that this is one of many possible solutions and there are alternative approaches to this problem, depending on the exact constraints and requirements.
