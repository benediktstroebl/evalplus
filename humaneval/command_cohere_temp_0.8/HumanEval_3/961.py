```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script introduces an iterative approach to account activity simulation and balance tracking. Within the loop, each operation is executed, and the balance is adjusted accordingly. Ultimately, the function returns True if the balance ever sinks below zero, or False if it manages to stay positive throughout the operations. 

This approach provides an effective and time-efficient way to determine whether the balance ever falls below zero, without the need for explicit initial balance declaration, thus making the function more versatile and adaptable to diverse scenarios. 

The function can be tested with the following scripts:
```python
import unittest

def test_below_zero():
    # Single positive integer
    assert below_zero([4]) == False

    # Multiple positive integers
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False

    # Positive and negative integers
    assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True

    # Only negative integers
    assert below_zero([-1, -2, -3]) == True

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This test script verifies the functionality of the `below_zero` function with a variety of operation lists, both positive and negative, confirming that it produces the correct output.
