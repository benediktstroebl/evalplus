```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each value in the input list. It accumulates the balance as it iterates through the operations. If the balance ever falls below 0, it immediately returns True, indicating that the balance went negative at some point. If no such scenario is encountered, it returns False at the end of the loop. 

This solution follows the given test examples provided in the prompt and should correctly solve the problem.
