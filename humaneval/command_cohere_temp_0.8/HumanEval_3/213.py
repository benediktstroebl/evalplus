```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations `ops` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each operation in the list. It accumulates the balance as it iterates through the operations. If at any point the balance falls below 0, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below 0, it returns `False`. 

This solution is concise and straightforward, and it should efficiently handle various cases of operations while staying within the self-contained requirement.
