```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It calculates the balance by summing up the operations, then determines whether the balance falls below zero at any point in the operations. If the balance ever goes negative, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This example simulates operations on a bank account, where `[1, 2, -4, 5]` leads to a negative balance and `[1, 2, 3]` does not.
