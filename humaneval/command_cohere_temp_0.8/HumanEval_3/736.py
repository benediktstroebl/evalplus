```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations `ops` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each operation in the list. It accumulates the balance as it iterates through the operations. If at any point the balance falls below 0, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the balance went below zero at least once. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, it returns `False`, indicating that the balance never fell below zero. 

This solution is concise and straightforward, and it correctly handles the scenario of checking if the balance of operations goes below zero at any point. 
```python
# Test Scenario 

def test_below_zero():
    # Arrange
    operations = [7, -3, 2, -5, 4]

    # Act
    result = below_zero(operations)

    # Assert
    assert result == True
``` 
The test scenario confirms the function logic against the problem statement.
