```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. It does so by iterating through each value in the input list and simulating the effect of each operation on the account balance.

The function starts by initializing the balance to zero. It then iterates through each element `op` in the input list of operations. For each operation, it adds the operation's value to the current balance. This simulates the effect of a deposit or withdrawal operation on the account balance.

During this process, if the balance ever falls below zero (meaning there is a negative balance), the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at some point during the operations. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, the function returns `False`. 

This function is useful in real-world financial scenarios, particularly in banking or accounting systems, where you need to ensure that account balances remain valid during series of transactions. 

The script passes the provided tests of returning `False` for `[1, 2, 3]` and `True` for `[1, 2, -4, 5]` because the balance never falls below zero in the first case but does in the second case.  This means that the function is working correctly as intended based on the problem statement.
