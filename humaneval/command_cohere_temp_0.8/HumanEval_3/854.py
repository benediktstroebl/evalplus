```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation represents a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money) and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. 

The function iterates through each operation in the list, updating the balance accordingly. If at any point the balance becomes less than zero, it immediately returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of iteration if the balance is still zero. 

This solution is efficient and linear in terms of time complexity since it iterates through each operation only once, making it an optimal solution for this problem. 
```python
# Tests:
assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
```
