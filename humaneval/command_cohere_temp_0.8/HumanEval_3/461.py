```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script introduces a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It simulates the actions of these operations on a bank account, initially set to zero balance, and checks whether the balance ever falls below zero. If it does, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function utilizes a simple loop to iterate through the operations list, accumulating the balance by adding each operation. If the balance drops to negative at any point, it immediately returns `True`.  This code follows the principle of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), as it avoids duplicating code and logic. 

Here is some example output testing the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
