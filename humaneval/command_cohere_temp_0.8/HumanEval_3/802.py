```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. The function calculates the net balance of the bank account by iterating through the list of operations, summing the deposits and withdrawals, and checks whether the balance ever falls below zero. If the balance is ever negative, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This example mimics the test cases stated in the original problem description.
