```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function iterates through the list of operations, accumulating the balance while keeping track of the current total. If at any point the total falls below zero, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the operation list. 

Here is an example usage of the code:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This example mirrors the usage described in the problem statement. The first example asserts that the balance will never go below zero, and the second example asserts that the balance will go below zero with the transaction list provided.
