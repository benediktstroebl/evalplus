```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It calculates the total balance of the operations and returns `True` if the balance ever falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a simple loop to iterate through the operations and updates the balance after each operation. 

Here is an example usage output:
```python
>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
>> below_zero([0, 5, -10, 3, 7])
True
>> below_zero([0, 5, 3, 7, 9])
False
``` 
This matches the test cases provided in the Markdown code block, as well as adds an additional test case.
