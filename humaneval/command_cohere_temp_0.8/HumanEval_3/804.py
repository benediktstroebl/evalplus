```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script introduces an iterative approach to account summing up the operations in the list, and at the very end checks if the final balance is less than zero. As the requested function is self-contained, it doesn't rely on any external libraries or environments, making it a stand-alone solution.
