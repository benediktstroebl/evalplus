```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation representing a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money) on a bank account. The function iterates through each operation, accumulating the balance, and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, indicating a deficit. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations if the balance remained non-negative. 

Here is an example usage of this code:
```python
# Test the function with a list of operations
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # Should print False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Should print True
``` 

This would output:
```
False
True
``` 

This demonstrates the function's ability to determine whether the balance falls below zero at any point during the given operations.
