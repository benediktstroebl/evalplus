```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function iterates through each operation in the list, updating the running balance by adding the `op`. If the balance ever falls below 0 at any point during the iteration, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once. If the loop completes without the balance ever falling below zero, it returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero. 

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem statement. It also follows Python's philosophy of "Easier to Read, Easier to Debug."
