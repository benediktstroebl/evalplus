```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It iterates through each operation in the list, accumulating the balance of the account. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account's balance went below zero at least once. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`, indicating that the account's balance never fell below zero. 

This solution is concise and straightforward, correctly reflecting the specifications laid out in the example. 

This code can be tested against the test cases provided in the problem statement as follows:
```python
> import unittest

> class TestBelowZero(unittest.TestCase):
...     def test_single_positive_op(self):
...         self.assertFalse(below_zero([1]))

...     def test_single_negative_op(self):
...         self.assertTrue(below_zero([-10]))

...     def test_multiple_ops_with_zero(self):
...         self.assertFalse(below_zero([1, 2, -3, 4]))

...     def test_multiple_ops_with_negative_balance(self):
...         self.assertTrue(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))
```

To run these tests, you can add the above class to a Python file and execute the file, or you can incorporate these tests into your test suite if you are already working in a test-driven development environment.
