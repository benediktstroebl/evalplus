```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an operation on the account, such as a deposit or withdrawal. The goal of this function is to determine if the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations, and returns `True` if it does, and `False` otherwise.

The function achieves this by initializing the balance to zero and then iterating through each operation in the input list. It updates the balance by adding or subtracting the effect of each operation. If at any point the balance becomes negative, it indicates that the account balance fell below zero, and the function returns `True`. If the balance remains non-negative throughout all operations, it returns `False`.

This solution is efficient since it has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations, making it suitable for handling large datasets.
