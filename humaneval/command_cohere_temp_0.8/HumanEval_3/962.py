```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of operations, presumed to be withdrawals and deposits, on a bank account. The function simulates these operations on a theoretical bank account and returns `True` if at any point the balance of the account falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It iterates through the list of operations, accumulating the balance based on the deposits and withdrawals, and checks if the current balance is less than zero at any point, returning `True` if it is.

Here is an example usage of this function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This example showcases two calls to the function, the first one returning false since the balance never falls below zero, and the second one returning true since the balance becomes negative after the -4 withdrawal.
