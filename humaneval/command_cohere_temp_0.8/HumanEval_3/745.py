```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script introduces a function `below_zero` that processes a list of `deposit` and `withdrawal` operations on a bank account. It keeps a running balance and returns `True` if the balance ever falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function is tested with examples showing True and False results, aligning with the problem statement.
