```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function iterates through the list of `operations`, summing them to the running balance. Whenever the balance falls below zero, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop if the balance remained non-negative. 

This approach is efficient (O(n)) and uses a linear traversal of the operation list, making it suitable for lists of any size. 

To make the function more efficient and avoid unnecessary computations, you can take advantage of the following techniques:
1. **Lazy Evaluation**: Instead of accumulating the balance as we iterate, we can defer the computation until needed. This is the principle behind lazy evaluation, common in functional programming paradigms.
2. **Memoization**: If we encounter the same operation multiple times, we can key it using its value and result and return the cached result instantly.

However, for simplicity and clarity, the above implementation suffices for this problem.
