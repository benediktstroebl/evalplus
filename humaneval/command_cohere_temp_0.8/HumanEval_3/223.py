```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script introduces a function `below_zero` that processes a list of operations, iteratively accumulating a balance using the given operations. If at any point the balance falls below zero, the function immediately returns `True`. If the entire list is processed without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns `False`. This solves the problem in a self-contained manner, detecting when the balance goes negative.  This approach is efficient and linear in terms of time complexity (O(n)) and suits the problem statement perfectly.  It is important to note that the returning of `True` or `False` depending on the balance going negative or not is following the requirements of the problem.
