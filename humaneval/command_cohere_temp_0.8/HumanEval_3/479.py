```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function increments the balance variable with each operation in the input list. If at any point the `balance` variable is less than zero, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop if the account balance was always zero or positive. 
Let's say we have two lists of operations, `ops1` and `ops2`, with the following integer operations:
```python
ops1 = [1, 2, -4, 5]
ops2 = [3, -7, 2, 6]
```

We can check if the balance falls below zero at any point in these two lists using the `below_zero` function:
```python
print(below_zero(ops1))  # Output: True
print(below_zero(ops2))  # Output: True
``` 

This would return `True` for both cases, since the balance falls below zero with the `-4` and `-7` operations in the respective lists. 
If the balance never falls below zero, the function returns `False`. For example: 
```python
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: False
``` 

In this case, the balance is never below zero, so the function returns `False`. 
This function is self-contained and can be easily reused to solve the "Bank Account Below Zero" problem, as it only depends on the `List[int]` annotation for the `operations` parameter, and it handles the zero-balance checks as requested.
