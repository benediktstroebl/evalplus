```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It calculates the net balance of the operations and returns `True` if the balance ever falls below zero, indicating a deficit. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The function uses a simple loop to iterate through each operation in the input list. It updates the balance by adding the value of each operation, and checks if the balance becomes negative at any point. If it does, the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`.

This solution is concise and efficient, directly addressing the problem statement using basic Python logic and typing. It allows to easily check if the balance of operations goes below zero at any moment.  This function can be called with different lists of operations to see if they cause the account to go into a negative balance.
