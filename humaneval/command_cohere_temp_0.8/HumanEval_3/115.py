```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates them into a running balance using an initial balance of 0. If at any point the balance falls below 0, it indicates that the account balance went negative at some point, and the function returns `True`. If the balance remains non-negative throughout all the operations, it returns `False`. 

This solution follows Python's style and syntax guidelines and is efficient, using just one pass through the input list. It can efficiently handle any number of operations and can be easily adapted to more complex financial scenarios.
