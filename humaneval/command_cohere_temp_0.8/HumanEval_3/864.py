```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation representing a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money) on a bank account. The function initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each operation in the list. It updates the balance after each operation, and checks if the balance goes negative at any point. If it does, the function returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once. If the balance never falls below zero, it returns `False`.

The function is designed to efficiently handle the check by keeping track of the account balance as it processes each operation, without the need to iterate the list multiple times.
