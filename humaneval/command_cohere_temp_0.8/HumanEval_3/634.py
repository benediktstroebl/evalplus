```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each operation in the input list.

For each operation, it adds it to the current balance. If at any point the balance falls below 0 (indicating a negative balance), it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If the loop completes without the balance ever going negative, it returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero.

The function is designed to efficiently handle the query and only performs a single pass through the input list of operations.
