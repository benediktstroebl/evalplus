```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script introduces an iterative approach to iterate through the sequence of `operations`, updating the running balance after each operation. Should the balance drop to a value less than zero, the function promptly returns `True`. If the sequence concludes without encountering a negative balance, it returns `False`. 

This approach guarantees that the function provides a Boolean result as requested, relying solely on the provided input and executing the requisite calculations sequentially. This solution employs a straightforward, linear methodology, making it both understandable and implementable.
