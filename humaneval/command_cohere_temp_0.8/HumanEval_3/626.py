```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point in the operations, and `False` otherwise. It accomplishes this by iterating through each operation in the input list and simulating the effect of that operation on the account balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns `False`. 

This solution follows the given test cases and correctly returns `False` for inputs like `[1, 2, 3]`, and `[1, 2, -4, 5]` to reflect scenarios where the account balance falls below zero and returns `True`. 

This approach has a time complexity of `O(n)` since it iterates through each element in the list exactly once.
