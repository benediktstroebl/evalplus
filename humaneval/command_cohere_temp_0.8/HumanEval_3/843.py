```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates them into a running balance using an initial balance of 0. It then checks if the balance goes negative at any point, and if so, it returns `True`. If the end of the list is reached and the final balance is still non-negative, it returns `False`. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list.
