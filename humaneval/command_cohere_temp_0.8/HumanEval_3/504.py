```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The task is to determine whether at any point the balance of the account falls below zero, and if so, the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False`. 

The function updates the balance by adding the value of the `operation`. If the balance is less than zero, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, it returns `False`. 

This solution is concise and straightforward, and it should provide the expected output for the given test cases as well as for any other valid input. 
```python
# Test Script
assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
```
