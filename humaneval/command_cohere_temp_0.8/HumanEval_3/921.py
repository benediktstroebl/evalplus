```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and determines whether the balance of a bank account, assuming a zero initial balance, would fall below zero at any point during the sequence of operations. 

The function iterates through each operation in the input list. It assumes that each operation represents either a deposit (positive integer) or a withdrawal (negative integer) to the bank account. It simulates the effect of each operation on the account balance and checks if the balance falls below zero at any point. If the balance ever goes negative, even for a single operation, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, it returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero during the sequence of operations. 

This approach ensures that the function promptly identifies scenarios where the account balance falls below zero, which aligns with the problem statement's requirements.

The unit tests for this code are designed to check that the function `below_zero` operates as expected. They cover a variety of scenarios, including situations where the account balance falls below zero and cases where it does not. Here is an example of how you might use this code and the tests:
```python
import unittest

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False

class TestBelowZero(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_single_positive(self):
        self.assertFalse(below_zero([1]))

    def test_single_negative(self):
        self.assertTrue(below_zero([-3]))

    def test_mixed_positive(self):
        self.assertFalse(below_zero([1, 2, -3, 4]))

    def test_mixed_negative(self):
        self.assertTrue(below_zero([3, -5, -7, 2]))

    def test_large_deposits(self):
        large_deposit = [1000, 2000, 3000]
        self.assertFalse(below_zero(large_deposit))

    def test_large_withdrawals(self):
        large_withdrawals = [500, -600, -700, -800]
        self.assertTrue(below_zero(large_withdrawals))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This test suite includes a variety of test functions, each of which examines a particular scenario or case. Each test is named to indicate the situation that is being tested. Inside these tests, the `assert__` statements indicate whether the `below_zero` function is expected to return True or False for a particular test scenario.

To use this code, you can add your own test cases in the `TestBelowZero` class to cater to more scenarios if needed. Once you've added all the test cases you want to cover, run the script. The `unittest` framework will run each test method, and you'll get feedback on which tests pass and which ones fail, giving you confidence in your code.
