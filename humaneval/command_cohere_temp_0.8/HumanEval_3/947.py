```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script introduces an additional variable, `balance`, which helps to keep track of the current state of the bank account. It is initialized to zero and updated with each operation. By simulating a real-world scenario, the script correctly detects when the balance falls below zero and returns `True`. If the balance remains positive throughout, it returns `False`. 

This approach ensures that the function works correctly with any list of operations and aligns with the problem statement and test cases provided.
