```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). The function simulates the progression of the account's balance after each operation and checks if it falls below zero at any point. If the balance ever goes negative, it returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`.

This solution follows the problem statement and passes the tests provided in the context. It's concise and uses a simple loop to iterate through the operations, updating the balance and returning the desired result based on the conditions.
