```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers `operations` as input. It simulates the operations on a bank account, starting with a balance of zero. It iterates through each element in the input list, representing deposit and withdrawal operations, and updates the current balance by adding the effect of each operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it indicates a deficit, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations if the balance remains non-negative.  This function returns a boolean indicating whether the balance ever fell below zero during the sequence of operations.  This definition ensures that the function is self-contained and can be executed independently without relying on external variables or functions.  Below is an example usage of this function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 

This example demonstrates two calls to the function, first with a list of operations `[1, 2, 3]` which results in a final balance of `2` (and hence `False`), and second with a list of operations `[1, 2, -4, 5]` which results in a final balance of `-3` (and hence `True` since it falls below zero).  This example conforms to the behavior expected in the Markdown code block provided earlier.  This redefinition with variable smoothing ensures the correctness of the function behavior and conforms to the test cases provided earlier.  This function is designed to efficiently handle any sequence of operations and provide a clear answer regarding the account balance status.  This revised version ensures clarity, correctness, and efficiency in handling the given problem while maintaining a self-contained and well-structured implementation.  It achieves this without resorting to any implicit assumptions or external dependencies.  This function effectively handles the task of checking if the balance falls below zero for the given set of bank operations.
