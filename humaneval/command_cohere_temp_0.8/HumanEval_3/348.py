```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It accomplishes this by iterating through each operation in the input list and accumulating a balance. If at any point the balance is less than zero, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations if the balance never fell below zero. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This example reflects the original problem specification, demonstrating that the function correctly detects if the balance falls below zero.
