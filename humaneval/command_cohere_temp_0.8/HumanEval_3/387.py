```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code tracks the balance as it processes each operation in the input list. If at any point the balance dips negative, it returns True, signaling that the account balance fell below zero at some point. If not, it returns False. 

This approach ensures that the function is self-contained and doesn't rely on external variables or states, making it reusable and maintainable. 

Such a concise and elegant solution validates the principle of "coding elegance," which promotes clarity, simplicity, and efficiency in programming.
