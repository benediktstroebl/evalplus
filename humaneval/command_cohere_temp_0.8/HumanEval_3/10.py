```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation representing a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money) on a bank account. The function calculates the net balance after each operation and checks if it goes below zero at any point. If the balance falls below zero at any moment, the function returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`.

Here is an example usage of the function showing a scenario where the balance falls below zero:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

And here is an example where the balance never falls below zero:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
``` 

This utility function can be used to robustly handle scenarios of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account, ensuring that account balances are correctly monitored.
