```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the actions of these operations on a bank account balance and checks if the balance ever falls below zero. If the balance goes negative at any point, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Here is an example usage of the function showing its behavior for the given test cases:
```python
# Test case 1
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: False

# Test case 2
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Output: True
``` 
This technique uses a simple loop to simulate the actions of the operations on the bank account balance, updating the balance accordingly. It's an efficient solution that avoids recursion and directly computes the result by iterating through the operations once.  This solution has a time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the operations list.
