```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations `List[int]` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and calculates the balance by adding the corresponding operation to the current balance. If the balance falls below zero at any point, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at any point during the operations. If no such instance is found, it returns `False` at the end of the operations list.

Here's an example of how you can use the `below_zero` function with a sample operation list:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
>>> below_zero([0, 0, 0, 0])
False
``` 

The first example returns `True` because the account balance will become negative after the `-4` withdrawal operation. The second example returns `False` because the account balance never falls below zero during the sequence of operations.
