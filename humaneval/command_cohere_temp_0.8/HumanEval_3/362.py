```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. The function initializes a variable `balance` to 0, which represents the balance of the bank account. It then iterates through each value in the input list `operations`, adding each operation to the balance. If the balance falls below 0 at any point, it indicates a withdrawal amount that causes the balance to go into negative territory, and in such a case, the function immediately returns `True`. If no such negative balance is encountered, it continues iterating and returns `False` once it has processed all operations without encountering a negative balance. 

This solution follows the prompt's expected functionality, accurately determining whether the balance falls below zero at any point in the given operations. 

This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations, as it requires iterating through each operation once to determine the outcome.
