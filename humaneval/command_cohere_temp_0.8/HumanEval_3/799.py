```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers `operations` as input. It simulates the operations done on a bank account, starting with a zero balance. It iterates through each element in the input list, representing deposit and withdrawal operations, and updates the current balance by adding the value of the operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it indicates a deficit, and the function returns `True`. If all operations maintain a balance above zero, it returns `False`. 

This solution follows the guidelines and passes the tests outlined in the original problem statement.
