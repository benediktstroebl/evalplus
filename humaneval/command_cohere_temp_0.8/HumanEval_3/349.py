```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates them into a running balance. If the balance drops to negative at any point, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations if the balance remained non-negative.
