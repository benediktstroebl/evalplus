```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after executing a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. It does so in the following steps:
- The function initialize a variable `balance` to 0, which represents the initial balance of the account.
- It then iterates through each element `op` in the input `operations` list.
- On each iteration, the balance is updated by adding the value of `op`. This simulates the effect of a deposit or withdrawal. If `op` is positive, it's as if a deposit was made; if `op` is negative, it simulates a withdrawal.
- If at any point the `balance` falls below zero, it means there was at least one moment where the account balance was negative, and the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance ever falling below zero, it means the account's balance never fell below zero, so the function returns `False`. 

The function returns `True` if the account balance ever falls below zero, even if it rises above zero later. It returns `False` if the account balance never falls below zero throughout the series of operations. 

This approach takes advantage of Python's strong typing and type inference system, which helps make the code both more readable and less error-prone.
