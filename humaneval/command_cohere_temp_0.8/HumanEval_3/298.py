```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code tracks the balance as it processes each operation in the input list. If at any point the balance drops below zero, it immediately returns True, indicating that the account balance fell into the red. If not, it finishes iterating through the operations and returns False, indicating that the account was always in the black. 

This approach takes advantage of the deterministic nature of the problem where each operation affects the balance predictably and solely on the current balance value. 

To make the code more robust and adaptable to variations in the problem description, it's better to incorporate error handling for invalid inputs and consider potential edge cases, like empty operation lists. 
However, this minimal initial implementation focuses on conveying the core logic to solve the problem. G
