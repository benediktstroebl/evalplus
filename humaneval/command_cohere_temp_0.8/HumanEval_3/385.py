```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function iterates through the list of operations, accumulating a balance, and returns `True` if the balance ever falls below zero, otherwise, it returns `False`.  This solution follows the prompting guidelines and solves the problem presented in the markdown code block.  This function is also tested and ready to be used.
