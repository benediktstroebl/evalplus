```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The function's purpose is to determine whether the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

The function starts by initializing the balance of the account to zero. Then, it iterates through each element in the `operations` list. For each operation, it adds the operation's value to the current balance. If the balance becomes negative at any point (meaning there is a net withdrawal exceeding the initial balance), the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account never fell into a negative balance during the sequence of operations. 

This solution is efficient because it uses a for loop to iterate through the operations list only once, directly calculating the balance after each operation and checking its validity simultaneously. 

The script passes the provided tests of returning `False` when the sequence of operations has no negative value, such as `[1, 2, 3]`. It also returns `True` when there is a sequence of operations that includes at least one negative value, such as `[1, 2, -4, 5]`.
