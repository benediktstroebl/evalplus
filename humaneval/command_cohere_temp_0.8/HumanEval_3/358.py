```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if at any point the balance of operations falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function increments the `balance` variable with each operation in the list, and checks if it is less than zero. If it is, the function returns `True`. If the balance is still zero after processing the operations, the function returns `False`.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
# Self-contained test examples
assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
```

This example test demonstrates how the `below_zero` function works. It first creates a list of operations, in this case `[1, 2, 3]`, and calls the `below_zero` function with this list as an argument. The function returns `False` because the balance is zero at the end of the operations. Then it creates a list of operations `[1, 2, -4, 5]` and calls the `below_zero` function with this list as an argument. The function returns `True` because at the end of the third operation, the balance is -1, which is less than zero.  This demonstrates that the function correctly identifies when the balance of operations falls below zero.
