```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). The function simulates the effect of these operations on a bank account's balance and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It does this by iterating through each operation in the input list, adding them to the current balance. If the balance drops to negative at any point, it returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop when the input is exhausted. 

Here is an example to demonstrate the functionality of the code:
```python
# Test the function
assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
``` 
This demonstrates the function working as designed, correctly identifying that the balance fell below zero in the second test case.
