```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function iterates through the list of `operations` and simulates the effect of each operation on the account balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`. This solution follows the theme of the `appy_parity` function in using a simple loop rather than a more complex approach like recursion or streaming. 

To validate the behavior of the function, two tests are provided:
```python
def test_below_zero():
    # Arrange
    operations = [1, 2, 3]

    # Act
    result = below_zero(operations)

    # Assert
    assert result is False 

def test_below_zero_balance_falls_below_zero():
    # Arrange
    operations = [1, 2, -4, 5]

    # Act
    result = below_zero(operations)

    # Assert
    assert result is True 

``` 

These tests cover both scenarios: one in which the balance never falls below zero and another where it does.
