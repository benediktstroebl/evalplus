```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function iterates through the list of operations, accumulating the balance while keeping track of the current total. If at any point the total becomes negative, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the operation list. 

Here is an example usage output:
```python
>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

And here is an example where the list of operations results in a non-negative balance:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
``` 
This completes the correctness and usability expectations for the provided prompt.
