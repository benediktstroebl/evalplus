```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (where each operation is represented as an integer, assuming it's either a deposit or a withdrawal of that much amount from the account). The function initializes the balance as 0, iterates through each operation, updates the balance accordingly, and checks if the balance ever falls below 0. If it does, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The script assumes that the given list is comprised of sequential deposit and withdrawal operations. 

This approach assumes that each operation in the list is either a deposit or a withdrawal, and the order of operations matters (a withdrawal followed by a deposit of the same amount won't result in a negative balance, whereas a withdrawal followed by a smaller deposit will). 

This solution is concise and directly iterates through the operations, checking the balance against 0. It does so in a straightforward manner that is easy to understand and avoids any unnecessary complexity.
