```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations on a bank account and returns `True` if the balance falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. It iterates through each operation in the list and updates the account balance accordingly. If the balance falls below zero at any point, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop when the balance is still non-negative.  This solution relies on local state (the variable `balance`) within the function, which captures the cumulative effect of the operations on the account balance as it iterates through the operation list.  It is a re-implementation of the problem's essence in Python, providing an accurate and efficient way to compute the result.
