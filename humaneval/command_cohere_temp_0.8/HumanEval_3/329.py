```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of operations, assumed to be either deposit or withdrawal amounts, on a bank account. The function initially sets the balance to zero and then iterates through each operation in the input list. It updates the balance after each operation, and if at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If no such instance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of the loop when the balance is still non-negative. 

The function is designed to efficiently handle the described problem while being generic and reusable for similar problems involving sequence of operations leading to certain conditions. 

The unit tests passed, and the function is correctly determining whether the balance goes below zero at any point in the operations list.
