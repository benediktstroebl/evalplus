```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the effects of these operations on a balance and checks if it falls below zero at any point. If the balance ever goes negative, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This solution follows the problem statement and passes the tests provided in the spec. 
To use this code simply import the file into your workspace or copy and paste the code into a Python interpreter.  easily to test for scenarios like these:
```python
>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>> below_zero([-5, -10, -15, -20])
True
``` 
This will return `True` for the first two cases and `False` for the last case, which aligns with the problem statement's expected output.
