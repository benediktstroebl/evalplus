```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. The function initializes a variable `balance` to 0, which represents the balance of the bank account. It then iterates through each element `op` in the `operations` list.

For each operation, it adds the operation's value to the current balance. If the new balance is less than 0 (meaning there is a negative balance), the function returns `True`. If the balance remains positive throughout all operations, it returns `False` at the end.

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem statement. It assumes that the given list of operations is executed in a sequential order, and it effectively simulates the state of the bank account during these operations to determine if it falls below zero at any point. 

The unit tests suggested in the problem statement would be appropriate to ensure that this function behaves as expected. These tests could include scenarios like the function being called with various `operations` lists, such as positive-only, mixed, and negative-only lists, to verify that the function's output matches the expected behavior.
