```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation representing a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money) on a bank account. The function calculates the net balance after each operation and checks if it goes below zero at any point. If the balance falls below zero at any moment, the function returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`.

Here's an example usage of the function showing that it returns `True` for a case where the account balance falls below zero:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

And here's an example where the account balance doesn't fall below zero, so the function returns `False`:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
``` 

This script adequately addresses the problem statement in the given markdown code block.
