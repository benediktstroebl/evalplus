```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and determines whether the balance of a bank account, initialized at zero, would fall below zero at any point when applying the given operations. It iterates through each operation in the input list, adding them to the running balance. If the balance ever becomes negative, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance falls below zero at that point. If no such negative balance occurs, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations. 

This solution is concise and directly iterates through the operations, making it efficient both in terms of code length and computational performance. It provides a straightforward way to check if an account's balance will fall below zero at any point with the given operations.  This approach ensures that it follows the intent of the problem statement and would efficiently pass the provided tests.
