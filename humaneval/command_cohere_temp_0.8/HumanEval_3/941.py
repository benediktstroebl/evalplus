```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each value in the input list. It simulates a bank account where each value in the input list could be a deposit or withdrawal operation (positive or negative value), the function keeps track of the balance and returns True if the balance ever falls below zero at any point, indicating that the account is in debt. Otherwise, it returns False.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
>>> below_zero([-10, -5, -20, -15, -5])
True
``` 

The function returns `True` for the examples where the balance falls below zero, and `False` for cases where the balance remains positive.  This allows you to confidently and accurately detect if an account will go into a negative balance state at any point with the given sequence of transactions.  This function is scalable, versatile, and can be used for a variety of different transaction scenarios.
