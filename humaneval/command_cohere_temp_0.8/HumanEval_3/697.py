```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It iterates through the list of operations, accumulating the balance while keeping track of the total. If at any point the balance becomes negative, it immediately returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop if the entire list of operations has been processed without causing the balance to drop below zero.  This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where `n` represents the number of operations in the input list.
