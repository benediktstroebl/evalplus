```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of integers `operations` as input, representing deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. It iterates through each operation in the list, accumulating the balance of the account. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero.

Here's an example of how you can test this script with a different case:
```python
# Test the below_zero function with a new input
>>> below_zero([-8, -3, -5])
True
>>> below_zero([-8, -3, -2, -5])
False
```
