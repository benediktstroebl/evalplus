```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `List[int]` and returns a boolean value of `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point in the operations list, and `False` otherwise. It achieves this by iterating through each operation in the input list and accumulating a balance. If at any point the balance is less than zero, it implies there is a moment when the account balance falls below zero, and hence the function returns `True`. Otherwise, if the balance is always non-negative, it returns `False` as the account never falls into a negative balance.  This solution relies on the cumulative sum method in order to solve the problem. 

This approach ensures that the function can be called with varying inputs and returns the correct result based on the conditions outlined in the problem description.
