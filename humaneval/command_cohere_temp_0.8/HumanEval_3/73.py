```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each value in the input list. It simulates a bank account where each item in the list can be either a deposit or withdrawal, represented by positive or negative integers respectively. It then checks if the balance goes below zero at any point, in which case it returns True, or if the balance remains non-negative at the end, in which case it returns False. 

This solution works correctly for the given test cases, as evidenced by the comments inside the function that show the behavior of the function for the provided examples.
