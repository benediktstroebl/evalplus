```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after executing a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. It does so in the following ways:
1. **Type Declaration**: The function starts by importing the `List` module from the `typing` module. This declaration indicates that the function expects a list of values as input. 

2. **List Iteration**: It initializes a variable called `balance` to 0, representing the initial balance of the account. It then iterates through each element (`op`) in the input list of operations.

3. **Update Balance**: In each iteration, it adds the value of `op` to the current balance, reflecting the effect of the operation. If the balance becomes negative during this process (i.e., at any point the balance is less than 0), it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at some point.

4. **Completes Iteration**: It completes the iteration over all operations even if the balance becomes negative, and returns `False` if the account balance never falls below zero.

This function enables you to determine whether an account can end up with a negative balance after any sequence of deposits and withdrawals by applying the given operations one by one to the initial balance of 0.
