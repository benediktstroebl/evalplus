```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after executing a series of deposit and withdrawal operations represented by the `operations` list.

The function iterates through each value in the `operations` list, adding each operation to the current balance. If at any point the calculated `balance` falls below zero, it implies there is a negative balance, and the function returns `True`. If the balance remains non-negative throughout all operations, the function returns `False` at the end. 

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem statement.

This script can be tested with the following Python code:
```python
assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
``` 
The first test case validates the function's functionality with a list of operations that never result in a negative balance, and the second test case confirms the function's correctness in identifying a sequence of operations that do result in a negative balance.
