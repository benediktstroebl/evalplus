```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each value in the input list. It simulates a bank account where each item in the list can be either a deposit (positive integer) or a withdrawal (negative integer) to the account. It accumulates the balance as it iterates through the operations. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went negative at some point. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop if the balance remains non-negative throughout all the operations.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
