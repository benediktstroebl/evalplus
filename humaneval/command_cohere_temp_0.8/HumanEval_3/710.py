```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function iterates through the list of `operations`, summing them to a running balance. If the balance ever drops below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If no such drop occurs, it returns `False` after processing all operations. This solves the problem as described in the prompt and aligns with the given tests.
