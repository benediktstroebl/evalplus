```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code tracks the balance as it processes each operation in the list. If the balance ever drops below 0, it returns True, signaling that the account entered a negative state at some point; otherwise, it returns False. 

This solution adheres to the problem statement and passes the given tests. Let me know if further clarification is needed or if you'd like to tackle another coding problem!
