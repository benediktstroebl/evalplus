```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. It iterates through each value in the input list and simulates the effect of the operation on the account balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`. 

This solution follows the problem statement and passes the tests provided. Let's break down the code:
1. It imports the `List` module from the `typing` module, allowing for type hints for the function argument and return value.
2. The function `below_zero` takes a list of operations as input and returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`) after processing the operations.
3. It initializes the balance to zero, as the account starts with zero balance.
4. Then, for each operation in the input list, it adds the operation's value to the balance to simulate the effect of that operation on the account balance.
5. If at any point the calculated `balance` becomes less than zero, indicating the account has insufficient funds, the function immediately returns `True`. If the balance remains non-negative after processing all operations, it returns `False`. 

Overall, this is a clean and efficient solution that is easy to read and follows the prompt's instructions.
