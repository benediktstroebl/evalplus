```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates them into a running balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went negative at some point. If no negative balance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations.

This solution is concise and directly iterates through the operations to determine if the balance goes negative, adhering to the problem's requirements. It provides an intuitive approach to solving this scenario and is applicable in various situations involving financial operations and balance calculations.
