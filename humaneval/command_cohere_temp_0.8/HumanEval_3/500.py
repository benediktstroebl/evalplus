```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (of type `List[int]`), where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). The function simulates the operations on the account and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It iterates through each operation in the list, updating the balance accordingly, and returns `True` immediately once a negative balance is encountered, assuming that the account balance couldn't recover afterward.  This solution relies on Python's typing module for type hints and embraces clear and readable code for better understandability and maintainability, which aligns with best practices in software development.
