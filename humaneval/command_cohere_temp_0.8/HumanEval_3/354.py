```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It iterates through each operation in the list, updating the running balance by adding the value of the operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at some point. If no such scenario is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations. 

This solution is concise and efficiently determines if the account balance goes below zero at any point during the sequence of operations. 

This code can be tested against the test cases provided in the problem statement as follows:
```python
>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
These would return the expected outputs, False and True respectively.
