```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code tracks the balance as it processes each operation in the input list. If at any point the balance dips negative, it returns True, signaling that the account balance fell below zero at some point. If not, it returns False.

Here's a simpler example to illustrate the core idea:
```python
def below_zero_ simplified(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This version starts with a zero balance and adds or subtracts each operation in the list. Immediately after processing an operation that makes the balance negative, it returns True. If no such operation is found, it returns False at the end. This version skips the typing annotation and uses a for loop instead of a list comprehension for clarity, making it suitable for learners new to type hints and comprehensions.
