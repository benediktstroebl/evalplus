```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The function's purpose is to determine whether the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

The function starts by initializing the balance of the account to zero. It then iterates through each element in the `operations` list. For each operation, it adds the operation's value to the current balance. If the balance becomes negative at any point (meaning there is a net withdrawal exceeding the initial balance), the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account never fell into a negative balance during the sequence of operations.

The script includes a docstring that provides detailed information about the problem, along with example inputs and expected outputs. These examples demonstrate how the function behaves for different sequences of operations. The examples show that the function returns `False` when the account's balance never falls below zero, and `True` when it does. 

Overall, this script provides a stand-alone function that accurately solves the problem and passes the tests outlined in the docstring.
