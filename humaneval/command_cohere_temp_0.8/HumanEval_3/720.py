```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integer operations, representing deposits and withdrawals, on a bank account. It iterates through each operation in the list, simulating the effect of each action on the account balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went negative at some point. If no such scenario is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations. 

This solution is efficient and directly iterates through the list, performing the calculations and checks inline, avoiding any extra space for auxiliary data structures.
