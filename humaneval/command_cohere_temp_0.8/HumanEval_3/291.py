```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. The function initializes a variable `balance` to 0, which represents the balance of the bank account. It then iterates through each value in the input list `operations`, adding each operation to the balance. If the balance falls below 0 at any point, it indicates a withdrawal amount that causes the balance to go into negative territory, and in such a case, the function immediately returns `True`. If no such negative balance is encountered, it continues iterating and returns `False` once it has processed all operations without encountering a negative balance. 

Here is an example usage of the code:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

This output demonstrates the function's behavior; `below_zero([1, 2, 3])` returns `False` since the balance never falls below zero with this sequence of operations. Conversely, with `below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])`, the account balance falls below zero with the withdrawal of $4, leading to a return value of `True`.  This function provides a precise way to identify whether an account balance could potentially go negative amidst a series of transactions.  Furthermore, it does so while ensuring that the function remains self-contained and does not introduce any external dependencies.  This characteristic is essential for producing dependable and easily transferable code.  Overall, the function is a concise and effective solution to the problem it was designed to address.
