```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an operation on the account, such as a deposit or withdrawal. The task is to determine whether the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

To achieve this, the function iterates through each operation in the input list. It updates the simulated account balance by adding or subtracting the value of each operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it implies that there was a withdrawal that caused the account balance to go into a negative state. In such a case, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero. If no such negative balance event occurs during the sequence of operations, the function iterates through all the operations and returns `False` once the loop completes, implying that the account never fell below zero. 

The function returns `False` if the balance never drops below zero, even if it's negative at the end of the sequence of operations. This is an accurate reflection of the problem statement's requirements. 

This solution is efficient because it uses a for loop, which is O(n), where n is the length of the input list `operations`, and it traverses the list exactly once. Also, the solution is compact and easy to understand, making it attractive for readability.
