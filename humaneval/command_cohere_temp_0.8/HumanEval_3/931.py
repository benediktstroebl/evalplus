```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after executing a series of deposit and withdrawal operations represented by the input list.

The function iterates through each element (`op`) in the input `operations` list. For each operation, it updates the running balance by adding the value of `op`. If the balance becomes negative at any point during this process, it indicates that the account balance fell below zero, and the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero during the given operations. 

This solution follows the specified convention and provides an accurate way to determine if the account balance falls below zero within a given set of operations.  It passes both provided tests and correctly returns `True` for examples like `[-4, 5]` and `[]`, and `False` for `[1, 2, 3]`.
