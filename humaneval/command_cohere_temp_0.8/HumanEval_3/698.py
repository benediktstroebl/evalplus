```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point after executing the operations, and `False` otherwise. It uses a for loop to iterate through each operation in the list, and adds each operation to the running balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This example usage demonstrates the function's behavior, specifically:
- The first test case, `below_zero([1, 2, 3]),`  returns `False` since the balance never falls below zero.
- The second test case, `below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]),`  returns `True` since the account balance falls below zero after the third operation. 
This would be the balance trajectory: [0, 1, 3, -1].
