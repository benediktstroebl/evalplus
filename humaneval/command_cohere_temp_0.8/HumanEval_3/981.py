```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script introduces an iterative approach to simulating the banking operations. The 'below_zero' function added to the given list of operations, sequentially, tracking the resulting balance after each operation. Whenever the balance falls below zero, the function immediately returns 'True'. If the entire list of operations is processed without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns 'False'. 

This approach guarantees a linear time complexity of O(n), where 'n' is the size of the input list, as it processing each operation only once.
