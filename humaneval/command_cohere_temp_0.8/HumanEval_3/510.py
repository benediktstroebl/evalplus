```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each operation in the list.

For each operation, it adds it to the current balance. If at any point the calculated balance falls below 0 (indicating a negative balance), it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once. If no such instance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of the loop when all operations have been processed.

The function is designed to efficiently handle the scenario of account balance going negative and provides the correct output for the given test cases.
