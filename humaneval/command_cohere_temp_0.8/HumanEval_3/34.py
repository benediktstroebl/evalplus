```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. The function initializes a variable `balance` to 0, which represents the balance of the bank account. It then iterates through each operation in the `operations` list and adds it to the balance. If the balance falls below 0 at any point, it indicates a withdrawal amount that causes the balance to go negative, and in this case, the function immediately returns `True`. If such a scenario is not encountered, it means the balance remains non-negative throughout the operations, and the function returns `False` after processing all the operations. 

This solution follows the prompt's expected functionality, where it returns `True` in the second example case of `[[1, 2, -4, 5]]` and `False` in the first case of `[[1, 2, 3]]`.
