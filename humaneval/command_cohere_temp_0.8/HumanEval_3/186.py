```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point in the operations or `False` otherwise. It does so by iterating through each operation in the list and accumulating the balance while checking if it goes negative at any point, accordingly returning the boolean value. 

This solution adheres to the problem's specifications and requirements as it correctly solves the task of detecting whether the balance falls below zero or not. Let me know if you would like me to provide any more information or additional examples to supplement this solution.
