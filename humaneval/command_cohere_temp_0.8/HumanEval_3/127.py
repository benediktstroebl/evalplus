```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations `List[int]` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and calculates the current balance by adding the operation value `op` to the previous balance. If the calculated balance is less than zero at any point, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at that operation. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`, indicating that the account never fell into a negative balance during the given operations. 

Here is a simple test to validate the functionality of the function:
```python
def test_below_zero():
    # Below tests are taken from the original problem description
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
    assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True

test_below_zero()
``` 

The `below_zero` function will return `True` if any operation causes the account balance to fall below zero and `False` otherwise. 

This approach is concise and straightforward, efficiently solving the problem using basic Python and typing principles.
