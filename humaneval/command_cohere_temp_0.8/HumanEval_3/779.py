```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function iterates through each operation in the list, updating the balance by adding the effect of each operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it indicates a deficit, and the function returns `True`. If the balance remains non-negative throughout all operations, it returns `False`. The function is designed to efficiently solve the problem statement and provide the desired outcome.
