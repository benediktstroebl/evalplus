```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and determines whether the balance of the account will fall below zero at any point. The function maintains a balance variable that keeps track of the current balance of the account. It iterates through each operation in the input list and adds the operation value to the current balance. If the balance falls below zero at any point, indicating a withdrawal that exceeds the account balance, the function immediately returns True. If no such negative balance is encountered, it returns False, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero. 

Here is an example usage of this function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

The example usage demonstrates the function's behavior and outputs.
