```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. The function initializes a variable `balance` to 0, which represents the balance of the bank account. It then iterates through each element `op` in the input list of operations.

For each operation, it adds the operation's value to the current balance. If the new balance becomes less than zero, it means the account balance has fallen below zero, and the function returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account never fell into a negative balance during the given operations. 

This solution is concise and directly iterates through the operations to calculate the account balance, checking at each step whether it falls below zero. It avoids any unnecessary complexity and is easy to understand. 

This approach allows the function to efficiently determine whether the account balance falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations without the need for additional data structures or intermediate variables.
