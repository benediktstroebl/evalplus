```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. The function iterates through each value in the input list and simulates the effect of the operation on a bank account's balance. It keeps a running total of the balance and checks whether it goes negative at any point. If the balance falls below zero at any moment, the function returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at any point during the sequence of operations. If the balance stays non-negative throughout, it returns `False`.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations, as it requires iterating through each operation once to determine the outcome.
