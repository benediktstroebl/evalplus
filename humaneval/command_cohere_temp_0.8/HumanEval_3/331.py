```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation represents a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money) and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. 

The function iterates through each operation in the list, accumulating a balance as it goes. If at any point the balance is less than zero, it means the account balance fell below zero at some point, so the function returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the balance never fell below zero. 

This solution is efficient and has a time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of operations given, which is the worst-case and average-case complexity. This is because the function needs to iterate through each operation once to determine the outcome.
