```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, representing deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. It iterates through each operation in the list, updating the balance by adding or subtracting the operation amount. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If no such instance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations. 

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem statement. It also follows Python's principle of "easy to read, easy to write," as it is concise and easy to understand. 

This code can be tested fairly with the following two unit tests: 
```python
def test_below_zero_true():
    # Single negative operation
    assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True

def test_below_zero_false():
    # No negative operations
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
``` 
These two example tests cover both scenarios described in the problem statement.
