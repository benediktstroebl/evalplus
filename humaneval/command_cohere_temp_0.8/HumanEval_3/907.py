```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. The function calculates the net balance of the bank account by iterating through the list of operations, summing up the deposits and withdrawals. If the net balance falls below zero at any point, it returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

This test case demonstrates the function's behavior, specifically indicating that in the first example the account never falls below zero, while in the second example, the account balance falls below zero with the sequence of operations.
