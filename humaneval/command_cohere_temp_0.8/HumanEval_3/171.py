```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations, presumably deposits and withdrawals, on a bank account. It initializes the balance to 0 and then iterates through the operations. For each operation, it adds it to the balance to simulate the effect on the account. If at any point the balance falls below 0 (indicating a negative balance), it immediately returns True, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at some point. If no such instance is encountered, it returns False at the end of the operations. 

This solution is concise and efficient, and it correctly solves the problem statement. Feel free to ask any questions or request further improvements!
