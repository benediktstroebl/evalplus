```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an operation on the account, such as a deposit or withdrawal. The goal of this function is to determine if the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

The function starts by initializing the balance of the account to zero. Then, it iterates through each element `op` in the `operations` list. For each operation, it updates the balance by adding the effect of that operation (positive for deposits, negative for withdrawals) to the current balance.

Here's an example of how you can use the `below_zero` function with a sample list of operations:
```python
# Example 1
assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False

# Example 2
assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
```

In the first example, the account starts with a balance of zero and then undergoes three operations (1, 2, and 3). Since the balance never falls below zero, the function returns `False`.

In the second example, the account starts with a balance of zero and then undergoes four operations (1, 2, `-4`, and 5). The second operation causes the balance to go into the negative territory (`-3`), and it remains negative throughout the rest of the operations. Therefore, the function returns `True`.

This function is versatile and can handle any combination of deposits and withdrawals, ensuring that it correctly detects if the balance falls below zero at any point in the sequence of operations.
