```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if at any point the balance of operations falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function iterates through each operation in the list, updating the running balance by adding each operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop if the balance is still zero. 

Here is an example usage output:
```python
>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
```python
>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
``` 
This example usage illustrates the function's behavior, returning `True` for the first example due to a negative balance occurring in the middle of the operation list, and `False` for the second example where the list of operations results in a positive balance at all times.
