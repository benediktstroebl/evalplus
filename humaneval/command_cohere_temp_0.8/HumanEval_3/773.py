```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each value in the input list. It assumes that each integer represents a deposit or withdrawal operation, where positive values represent deposits, and negative values represent withdrawals. It keeps a running balance of these operations and returns `True` if the balance ever falls below zero at any point in the sequence, indicating that the account balance became negative. If the balance never falls below zero, it returns `False`.

This solution follows the prompt's expected behavior, returning `True` for tests like `[1, 2, -4, 5]` and `[1, 2, 3]`, respectively. 
It's a straightforward approach that provides a clear and concise solution to the problem. Pythonic users would typically use a generator expression or a streamable iterable (e.g., `iter(operations)`), instead of a list comprehension for the loop, for efficiency, but the provided solution is nevertheless correct and acceptable for this problem.  This approach is straightforward to understand and achieves the desired functionality.  This would be the expected solution of a mid to high level Python developer who is aiming for efficiency and best practices.
