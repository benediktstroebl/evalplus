```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and calculates the balance by adding the corresponding operation. If the balance falls below zero at any point, it immediately returns `True`. If the end of the list is reached without the balance falling below zero, it returns `False`. 

This solution follows the `structured programming` philosophy and is considered to be `Pythonically correct`. 

Let's break down the solution: 

1. It uses the `List` type annotation from Python's typing module to ensure type-safety. 
2. The function utilizes a `for` loop to iterate through the list of operations. This ensures that each operation is processed sequentially. 
3. It maintains a running balance to keep track of the current balance of the account. 
4. The line `if balance < 0:` checks if the balance falls below zero at any point, and if so, it immediately returns `True`. 
5. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, it returns `False`, indicating that the account never fell into a negative balance. 

This solution is considered adequate for the given problem and aligns with Python's philosophy of using readable language constructs that are also efficient. Pseudocode variants like using a `while` loop with `break` statements for flow control would be mechanically inferior as they complicate the otherwise simple `for` loop and don't bring any additional readability.
