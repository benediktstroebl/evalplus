```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It iterates through the list of operations, accumulating a balance, and returns `True` if the balance is ever negative, assuming that a negative balance indicates a withdrawal. It returns `False` if no such negative balance is encountered.

Here is an example usage of the code:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This example test case demonstrates the function's behavior and returns `False` for the first case and `True` for the second case of operations respectively.
