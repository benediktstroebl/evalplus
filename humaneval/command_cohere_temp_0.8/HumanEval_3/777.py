```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. It does so by iterating through each value in the input list and simulating the effect of each operation on the account balance.

The function starts by initializing a variable called `balance` to 0, which represents the initial balance of the account. It then iterates through each element `op` in the `operations` list. For each operation, the function adds the value of `op` to the `balance`. This simulates the effect of a deposit or withdrawal operation on the account balance.

During each iteration, the function checks if the updated balance is less than 0. If it is, this indicates that at some point the account balance fell below zero, likely due to a sequence of deposits and withdrawals. In this case, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once during the sequence of operations.

If the loop completes without the account balance ever falling below zero, it means the account balance stayed positive throughout the sequence of operations. In this case, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account never fell into a negative balance.

The script includes example tests that demonstrate the functionality of the `below_zero` function. These tests showcase scenarios where the account balance falls below zero and scenarios where it does not, thereby validating the correctness of the implemented solution.
