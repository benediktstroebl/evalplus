```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each value in the input list. It accumulates the balance as it iterates through the operations, and it returns `True` immediately once the balance falls below 0, and `False` otherwise.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
This will return `False` for the first example and `True` for the second example, which conforms to the original problem description.

The script correctly solves the problem using simple bookkeeping and returns the correct value. It is concise, and direct to the point and should serve as a good solution for the problem at hand.
