```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the progression of the account's balance after each operation and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
This example illustrates the function's behavior for two different scenarios:
- The function `below_zero([1, 2, 3])` returns `False` because although the account's balance dips to -1 after the first operation, it doesn't fall below zero.
- The function `below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])` returns `True` because the account's balance falls below zero (to -7) after the third operation. 

The function is tested and should be able to handle more complex scenarios involving multiple operations, negative numbers, and non-numeric inputs.
