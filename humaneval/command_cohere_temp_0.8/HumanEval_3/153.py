```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the effect of these operations on a bank account starting with a balance of zero, and returns `True` if at any point the account balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It iterates through each operation in the input list, adding the operation value to the current balance. If the balance falls below zero at any point, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, it returns `False`. 

Here is an example usage example of this code to illustrate its functionality:
```python
 >>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
 >>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

This example test scenario demonstrates the function's behavior correctly. It tests the function on two different input operation lists, one that does not result in a balance below zero and one that does. This thereby validates the functionality of the code.
