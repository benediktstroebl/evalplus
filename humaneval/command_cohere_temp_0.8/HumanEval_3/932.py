```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point after applying the operations, and `False` otherwise.

The function uses a loop to iterate through each operation in the list and accumulates the balance of the account as it goes. If at any point the balance falls below zero, the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, the function returns `False`.

Here is an example usage of this function:
```python
# First Example Usage
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # Expected output: False

# Second Example Usage
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Expected output: True
```

This demonstrates the function's behavior correctly. The first call with `[1, 2, 3]` returns `False` since the balance never falls below zero. The second call with `[1, 2, -4, 5]` returns `True` because the account balance falls below zero after the second operation.
