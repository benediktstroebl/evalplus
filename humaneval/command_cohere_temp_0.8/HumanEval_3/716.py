```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and determines whether the balance of a bank account, which starts at zero balance, falls below zero at any point during the specified operations.

The function iterates through each operation in the input list. For each operation, it updates the current balance by adding the effect of the operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the balance went negative at some point. If the entire list of operations is processed without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account remained with a positive balance throughout the operations.
