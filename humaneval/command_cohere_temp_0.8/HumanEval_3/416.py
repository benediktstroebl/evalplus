```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero()` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the progression of the account's balance after each operation and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It iterates through each operation in the input list, adding the operation's value to the current balance. If the balance falls below zero at any point, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`. 

Here is an example usage illustration of the function using Python's REPL `>>>` prompt:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This demonstration showcases two instances of the function's application. The first example uses a list of operations `[1, 2, 3]`, which represents a series of deposits that never drop the balance below zero, resulting in `False`. The second example uses a list of operations `[1, 2, -4, 5]`, where the account balance dips below zero with the third operation (-4), causing the function to return `True`.  This pattern of usage demonstrates the function's behavior and its correctness in resolving the posed issue.
