```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script introduces an iterative approach to solve the problem. The `below_zero` function takes a list of `operations` as an argument and uses a loop to iterate through each operation. It updates the balance after each operation and checks if it becomes negative at any point. If the balance falls below zero at any moment, the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping to zero, the function returns `False`. 

This approach improves efficiency by calculating the balance incrementally, eliminating the need for a recursive call stack.
