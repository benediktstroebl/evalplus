```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations `ops` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates them into a running balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If the entire list is processed without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`. 

This solution is concise and straightforward, directly addressing the problem statement using a loop and a simple balance accumulator. It passes the provided tests because it correctly identifies whether the account balance falls below zero at any point in the given operations.  This is done while maintaining type safety through the use of the `List` and avoiding unnecessary complex logic or additional variables.  By using this approach, the code is both efficient and easy to understand.
