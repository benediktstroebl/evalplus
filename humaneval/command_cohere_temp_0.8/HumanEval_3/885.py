```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations `ops` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates the balance of the bank account. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If the entire list is processed without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero. 

This solution tests the robustness of the function by checking if it can handle any input that would make a normal person doubt the robustness of their algorithm.
