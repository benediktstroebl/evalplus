```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the actions of these operations on a bank account balance and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It iterates through each operation in the input list, adding the operation value to the current balance. If the balance drops to zero or becomes negative at any point, it immediately returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop if the entire list of operations is executed without the balance dropping below zero. 

Here is an example usage of this code:
```python
# Test the function with a simple list of operations
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # Expect False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Expect True
```

This would yield the following output:
```
False
True
``` 

This function can also be optimized to terminate early if a negative balance is detected, but the basic logic outlined above captures the core idea.
