```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The function's purpose is to determine whether the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

The function starts by initializing the balance of the account to zero. It then iterates through each element in the `operations` list. For each operation, it adds the operation's value to the current balance. If the balance becomes negative at any point (meaning there was a withdrawal that caused the balance to drop below zero), the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account never fell into a negative balance during the sequence of operations. 

This solution is straightforward and efficiently determines whether the account balance falls below zero at any point. And since it iterates through the list only once, it has a time complexity of O(n), where 'n' is the length of the operations list.
