```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an operation on the account, such as a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount.

The function starts with the balance set to zero and then iterates through each operation in the input list. For each operation, it updates the balance by adding or subtracting the operation amount, depending on whether it's a deposit or withdrawal, respectively.

The function checks after each operation if the updated balance is less than zero. If this condition is met at any point, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the balance fell below zero at least once during the sequence of operations. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, the function returns `False`.

This solution is efficient because it processes each operation only once and has a time complexity proportional to the size of the `operations` list.
