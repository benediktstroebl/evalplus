```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if at any point the balance of operations falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function iterates through each operation in the list, accumulating the balance, and returns `True` if the balance ever becomes negative. The function returns `False` if the balance never becomes negative. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This example usage demonstrates the function's behavior, specifically:
- The first example tests the function with a list of operations `[1, 2, 3]` where the balance will never fall below zero, and the function returns `False`.
- In the second test, the function is applied to a list of operations `[1, 2, -4, 5]` where the balance falls below zero between the second and third operations. Consequently, the function returns `True`. 
This reusable function solves the problem statement and passes the provided tests. It allows you to efficiently analyze lists of operations to determine if they result in a negative balance, providing a practical tool for financial and algorithmic scenarios involving account balances.
