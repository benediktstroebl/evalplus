```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). The function iterates through each operation in the list, simulating the effect on the account balance and checking if it falls below zero at any point. If the balance ever goes negative, it immediately returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop when all operations are processed. 

This solution is concise, efficient (O(n)) and follows Python's PEP-484 style typing for more reliable code. 

This solution can be improved further by using a data structure like a stack to more efficiently keep track of the increasing and decreasing values, especially if the list of operations is long and the tests are many.
