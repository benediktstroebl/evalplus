```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function increments a variable `balance` for each operation in the input list. If at any point the `balance` is less than zero, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop if no negative balance is encountered. 

Here is an example usage of the code where it is tested with two examples and asserted whether the account balance falls below zero or not:
```python
assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
```

This test case checks if the function `below_zero` works correctly for the given inputs. 

*Note*: The order of the operations list is not mandated and the function is designed to work regardless of the order of the operations.
