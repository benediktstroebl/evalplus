```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation represents a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money). The function initializes a variable `balance` to 0, and iterates through each operation in the input list. It accumulates the sum of operations in the `balance` variable. If at any point the balance falls below 0 (indicating a negative balance), the function immediately returns `True`. If no negative balance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end. 

This solution follows the prompt's expected output and returns `True` if any point the balance falls below zero and `False` otherwise. 

This approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations in the input list.
