```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the effects of these operations on a bank account starting with a balance of 0. It iterates through each operation in the input list and updates the balance accordingly. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it indicates that the account balance became negative at some point, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, if the balance remains non-negative throughout all the operations, it returns `False`. 

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem statement. It can efficiently handle various scenarios of deposit and withdrawal operations and provides useful feedback on whether the account balance fell below zero at any point. 

This code does not utilize any third-party libraries and doesn't require any additional dependencies. It is a self-contained solution that follows Python's standard typing and list manipulation techniques.
