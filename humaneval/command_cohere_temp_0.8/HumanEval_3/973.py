```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point in the operations, and `False` otherwise. It achieves this by iterating through each operation in the list and updating the current balance accordingly. 

The function's behaviour aligns with the specified test cases, returning `False` for lists of operations like `[1, 2, 3]`, and `[1, 2, -4, 5]` respectively. 

To showcase the function's behaviour, here's an example of using the function with a sample operation list:
```python
# Example Operations
operations = [5, -10, 10, -5]

# Calling the function
result = below_zero(operations)

# Printing the result
print(result)
```

With the above operations, the account balance will be -5 after the first two operations, and the function will return `True`. 

The output will be:
```bash
True
```
