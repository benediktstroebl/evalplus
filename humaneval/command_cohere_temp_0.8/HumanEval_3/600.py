```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. The function initializes a variable `balance` to zero, and then iterates through each value in the input list. It adds each operation to the running total `balance`, and checks if it falls below zero at any point. If the balance is ever negative, it returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop when all operations have been processed.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This example shows the function's behavior when provided with two different lists of operations. The function correctly returns `False` when the account balance never falls below zero, and returns `True` when it does.  This aligns with the function's expected behavior as described in the problem statement.
