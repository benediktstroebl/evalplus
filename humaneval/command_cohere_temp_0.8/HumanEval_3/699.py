```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the actions of these operations on a balance and checks if it falls below zero at any point. If the balance ever becomes negative, it returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

This example corresponds to the test cases provided in the problem statement. In the first example, the account balance never falls below zero, hence `below_zero` returns `False`. In the second example, the account balance falls below zero with the second operation (-4), so `below_zero` returns `True`.
