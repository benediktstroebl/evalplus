```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. The function calculates the net balance of the bank account by iterating through the list of operations, where each element in the list represents a deposit or withdrawal operation. It keeps track of the balance and checks whether it goes below zero at any point. If the balance falls below zero at any moment, the function returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went negative; otherwise, it returns `False` at the end. 

This solution is encapsulated and efficient, directly solving the problem statement without excessive complexity.
