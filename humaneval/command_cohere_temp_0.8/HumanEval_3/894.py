```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after executing a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. It does so in the following steps:
1. The function initialize a variable `balance` to zero, this represents the initial balance of the account, which is $0.
2. It then iterates through each element in the input list of operations, these operations are represented as positive integers, each of these operations can either be a deposit (positive number) or a withdrawal (negative number) operation.
3. For each operation, it adds its value to the current balance, thus updating the balance accordingly. 
4. The function returns `True` immediately when the balance falls below zero at any point in the operations list, this indicates that at least one step the account balance was negative.
5. If the loop completes without the balance ever falling below zero, it means the account balance remained non-negative throughout all the operations and the function returns `False`. 

The function returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`) depending on whether the account balance falls below zero at any point during the given operations.

Here are some examples of function calls to illustrate its behavior:
```python
# Example 1
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False

# Example 2
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

In the first example, the account balance never falls below zero after applying the operations `[1, 2, 3]`, so the function returns `False`.

In the second example, the account balance becomes negative after applying the operation `-4`, resulting in a balance of -1. Therefore, the function returns `True`.
