```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and determines whether the balance of a bank account, initialized at zero, would fall below zero after executing all the given operations. The function iterates through each operation in the input list, adding or subtracting them from the current balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If no such point is reached, it returns `False` after processing all operations. This functionality allows you to answer questions about the effects of operations on the account balance.
