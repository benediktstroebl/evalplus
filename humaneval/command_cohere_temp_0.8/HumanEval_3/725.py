```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and simulates the effect of that operation on a bank account balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, it returns `False`. 

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem statement. It handles various scenarios, including positive, negative, and zero values in the `operations` list. 

This code is succinct, yet expressive, and follows Python best practices for readability and maintainability. 

This solution can be tested quite easily, for instance, by calling the function on the baseline tests provided, like this:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
and verifying its behavior against the problem statement.
