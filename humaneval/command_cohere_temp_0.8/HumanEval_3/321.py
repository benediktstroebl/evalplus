```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. The function iterates through each value in the input list and simulates a bank account's balance after each operation is performed. If at any point the balance falls below zero, the function immediately returns `True`. If the balance stays non-negative until the end of the operations, it returns `False`. This functionality is illustrated in the docstring's example tests, where it returns `False` for a list of positive operations and `True` for a list that includes a withdrawal operation. 

This implementation provides a clear and concise way to determine if a bank account's balance will fall below zero at any point given a sequence of operations.
