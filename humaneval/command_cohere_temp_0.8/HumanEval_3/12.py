```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, representing deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. It iterates through each operation in the list, updating the balance by adding or subtracting the operation amount. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at some point. If no such scenario is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations. 

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem using basic python syntax and logic, ensuring robustness and efficiency. 

The unit tests for this code can be added as a separate list of test cases to verify the correctness of the function. For example:
```python
# Test cases
assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
assert below_zero([0, 0, 0]) == False
assert below_zero([-10, -5, -1, 2, 3]) == True
``` 
These tests cover a variety of scenarios to ensure that the function correctly detects when the balance falls below zero.
