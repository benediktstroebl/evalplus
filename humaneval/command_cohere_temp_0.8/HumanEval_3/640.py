```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It iterates through each operation in the list, updating the balance by adding or subtracting the value of the operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If no such instance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations. 

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem statement. It also follows Python's philosophy of "Simplicity First," as it uses a simple loop and conditional to solve this problem, which is efficient and easy to understand. 

The function can be tested as follows:
```python
# Test case 1
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: False

# Test case 2
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Output: True
``` 
This will help ensure that the function behaves as expected.
