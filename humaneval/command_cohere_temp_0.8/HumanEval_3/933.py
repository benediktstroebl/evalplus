```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `List[int]` and calculates the descending balance of the bank account through each operation. If the balance drops below zero at any point, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`. The script passes test cases mentioned in the original prompt as well as additional test cases. 
For example:
```python
# Test case where balance goes negative
assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True

# Test case with positive balance throughout
assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
``` 
This function is also compatible with negative operations, as well as with `0` values in the operation list: 
```python
assert below_zero([0, -3, 4, -2, 2]) == True
``` 
This function is computationally efficient since it uses only a single loop to process the operation list. 
It is also worth noting that this function assumes that the list of operations is executed in sequence and that every operation is executed exactly once.
