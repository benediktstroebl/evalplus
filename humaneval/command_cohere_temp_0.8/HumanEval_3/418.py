```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the effects of these operations on a bank account's balance and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It does this by iterating through each operation in the input list and updating the balance accordingly. 

Here is an example usage output:
```python
>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

And here is an example where the balance doesn't fall below zero:
```python
>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
``` 
This script encapsulates the logic of the problem in a concise and reusable manner.
