```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if at any point the balance of operations falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function increments the `balance` variable with each operation in the list, and checks if it is less than zero. If it is, the function returns `True`. If the balance is still zero after processing the entire list, the function returns `False`. 

This solution follows the prompt's expected functionality, hence should pass the accompanying tests.
