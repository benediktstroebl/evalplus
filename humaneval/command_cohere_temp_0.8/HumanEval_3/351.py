```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, representing deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. It iterates through each operation in the list, updating the balance by adding or subtracting the operation amount. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If no such instance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations. 

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem statement. It also follows Python's idiomatic style and uses features from the Python standard library, such as the `typing` module, to ensure type safety and functionality. 

This code can be tested against the test cases provided in the problem statement to ensure its correctness. 

Incorporating this code into your project will allow you to detect when the balance of a bank account falls below zero, helping you to manage potentially risky financial scenarios.
