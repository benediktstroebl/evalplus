```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. The function calculates the balance of the bank account by summing up the deposit and withdrawal operations in the input list. It then checks if the balance falls below zero at any point, and returns `True` if it does. If the balance never falls below zero, it returns `False`.

The `below_zero` function detects if the balance of the account falls below zero, regardless of the order of the operations, as long as they sum up to a negative value eventually.

This solution relies on the simplicity of the problem and the straightforward interpretation of the input data to solve the problem. It uses a for loop to iterate over each operation in the list, summing them up into the `balance` variable. Once the loop completes, the function returns either `True` or `False`, depending on whether the balance was ever negative. 

This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations, which is optimal for this problem.
