```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The task is to determine whether the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

The function initialization sets the balance to 0, and then it iterates through each element in the input list `operations`. For each operation, it adds the operation's value to the current balance. If the balance becomes negative at any point (meaning a withdrawal is larger than the current balance), the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once. If the loop completes without the balance ever going negative, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero throughout the sequence of operations.

This approach takes advantage of short-circuit logic evaluation in Python. As soon as the condition `balance < 0` is evaluated to `True`, the function returns `True` without needing to process the remaining operations. This is efficient and suits the problem requirements, avoiding the need for an explicit loop index parameter.
