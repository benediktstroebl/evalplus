```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each value in the input list. It assumes that each integer represents an operation on a bank account where a positive integer represents a deposit, and a negative integer represents a withdrawal. It keeps a running balance of these operations and returns `True` if the balance ever falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is an example:
```python
# Hypothetical Operations on an Account
operations = [5, -10, 7, -3, 2]

# Function Call
result = below_zero(operations)
print(result)  # Output: True
``` 

This would print `True` since the account balance drops below zero after the third operation, `-3`. 

This script provides a simple and efficient way to detect if the balance of an account ever goes below zero, given a list of operations, without the need for explicit looping and conditional statements.
