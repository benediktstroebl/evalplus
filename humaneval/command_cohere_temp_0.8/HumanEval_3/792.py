```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each value in the input list. It simulates a bank account where each item in the list can be either a deposit or withdrawal, represented by positive or negative integers, respectively. It keeps a running total of the balance and checks whether it goes negative at any point. If it does, the function returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once. If no negative balance is encountered, it returns `False`.

Here is an example usage:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This example demonstrates the function's behavior for two different input lists, illustrating whether the account balance falls below zero at any point in time.
