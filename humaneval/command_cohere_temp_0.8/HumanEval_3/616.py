```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations `List[int]` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates them into a running balance using an initial balance of 0. It checks if the balance falls below 0 during this process and returns `True` if it does, and `False` otherwise. The function is designed to handle any list of operations and provides a boolean result based on the criteria specified in the problem statement.  This approach is efficient and suits the problem's requirement to optimally test for balance going below zero.
