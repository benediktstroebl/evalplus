```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function iterates through the list of `operations`, summing them to a running balance. Whenever the balance falls below zero, it returns `True`. If no such scenario is encountered, it returns `False` once it's finished iterating through the list. 

This solution follows Python's philosophy of " simplest thing that could possibly work "" and leverages descriptive variable names and type annotations to enhance readability and maintainability.  Optionally, you could also employ a `return` statement instead of a `bool` alias for the shortest possible code. 

This approach remains functional and efficient, making it an optimal solution for this problem.
