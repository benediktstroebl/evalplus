```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. The function increments the `balance` variable with each operation, and checks if it crosses zero. The tests provided in the problem statement fail if the function returns anything other than `True` in the first case or `False` in the second case. 

```python
test_cases = [
    ([1, 2, 3], False),
    ([1, 2, -4, 5], True),
]

for operations, expected in test_cases:
    actual = below_zero(operations)
    assert actual == expected
```
This would result in a test suite that passes with the provided code.
