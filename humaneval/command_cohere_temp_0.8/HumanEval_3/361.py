```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. The function initializes a variable `balance` to 0, which represents the balance of the bank account. It then iterates through each element `op` in the input list of operations.

For each operation, it adds the operation's value to the current balance. If the new balance becomes less than zero, it indicates that the account balance has fallen below zero, and the function returns `True`. If the account balance remains non-negative throughout all the operations, it returns `False` after processing all the operations.

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem statement. It handles scenarios like negative operations, multiple negative operations, and any sequence of operations that might result in a negative balance at any point.
