```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations `List[int]` as input. It iterates through each operation in the list and calculates the balance by adding the corresponding operation to the previous balance. If the balance falls below zero at any point, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero. If no such instance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of the loop when all operations are processed. 

This solution follows the prompt's expected functionality, accurately determining whether the account balance falls below zero at any time during the sequence of operations. 

This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations in the input list, making it suitable for handling large datasets efficiently.
