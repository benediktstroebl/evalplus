```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). The function simulates the actions of these operations on a bank account balance and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It iterates through each operation in the input list, adding the operation value to the current balance. If the balance drops to or below zero at any point, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`. 

Here is an example usage of this code:
```python
# Test the function with a list of operations
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # Should print False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Should print True
``` 

This would output:
```
False
True
``` 

This function can be used to quickly check if any point of a series of operations results in a balance below zero.
