```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation can be either a deposit or withdrawal of money from an account) and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It achieves this by iterating through each operation in the list and keeping track of the running balance. If at any point the balance is less than zero, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of iteration if the balance is still zero or positive. 

This approach ensures that the function directly solves the problem statement without introducing complexities like recursion or explicit tracking of multiple balance points. The resulting code is concise, readable, and easily adaptable to potential edge cases that might be asked related to the problem.
