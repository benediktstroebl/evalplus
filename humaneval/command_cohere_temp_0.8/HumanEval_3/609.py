```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations `List[int]` representing deposits and withdrawals from a bank account. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each operation in the input list.

For each operation, it adds it to the current balance (withdrawal if the operation is negative, deposit if positive). It simulates the progression of the account balance step by step, updating the balance based on each operation.

If at any point the balance falls below 0 (indicating a negative balance), it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at some point during the operations. If the loop completes without the balance ever going below zero, it returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero.

The function utilizes Python's typing module for type hints and provides a clear and efficient solution to the problem statement. It includes a docstring with an example usage that aligns with the problem description. The approach is straightforward and elegant, making it easy to determine if the account balance will go negative at any point during the given operations. 

You can test this function with other input lists to verify its behavior for different scenarios. 
```python
# Test the function with some sample inputs
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # Should return False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Should return True
``` 
This enhances the function's usability and readability, making it easier for users to understand and utilize the function with various input scenarios.
