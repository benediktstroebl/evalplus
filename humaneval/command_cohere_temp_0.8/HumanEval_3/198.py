```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and then iterates through each value in the input list. It accumulates the balance as it goes through the transaction list. If at any point the balance falls below 0, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below 0, it returns `False`.

This solution follows the specified API and behaves as expected based on the test cases provided. It is concise and uses a simple loop to solve the problem. 

This script produces a function that solves the problem using only information contained in the code block, and should be reproduceable in a markdown cell. 

Feel free to ask any questions or make any requests regarding clarity, and I'll be glad to help!
