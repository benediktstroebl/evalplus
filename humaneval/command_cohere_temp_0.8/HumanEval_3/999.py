```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function iterates through each operation in the list, simulating the effect of each operation on the account balance. It keeps track of the balance as it processes each operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at some point. If the loop completes without the balance ever going negative, it returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero. 

This solution is concise and efficiently detects whether the account balance falls below zero at any point. 
Let me know if you would like me to explain any part of the solution or provide additional insights. 
I can also iterate different scenarios with the provided test cases to show how the function works.
