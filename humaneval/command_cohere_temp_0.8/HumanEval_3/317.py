```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. The function calculates the net balance of the bank account by iterating through the list of operations, summing up the deposits and withdrawals. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it indicates a deficit, and the function returns `True`. If the balance remains non-negative at the end of operations, it returns `False`.

This approach ensures that the function is self-contained and does not rely on external variables or assumptions about the context in which it is called. 

This code uses python's strong typing to enforce the input type enforcing the input to be a list of integers. 

The function is also designed to handle any reasonable input size gracefully as it uses a for loop to iterate over the operations, which should not performance concern for a reasonable amount of operations. 
```python
assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
assert below_zero([10, -20, 5, -15, 0, 0, 50]) == True
```
