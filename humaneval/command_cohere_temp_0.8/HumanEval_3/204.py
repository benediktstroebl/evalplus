```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of a bank account, which starts with a balance of 0, can fall below zero after executing a series of deposit and withdrawal operations specified in the input list.

The function utilizes a simple loop to iterate through each operation in the input list. For each operation, it updates the current balance by adding or subtracting the value of the operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it implies that there is a moment when the account balance became negative, and thus, the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it implies that all operations kept the account balance non-negative, and the function returns `False`.

This approach ensures that the function directly returns a boolean result without requiring any explicit state management beyond the initial balance variable, making the function self-contained and easier to maintain.
