```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each operation in the input list.

For each operation, it adds it to the current balance (withdrawal if the operation is negative, deposit if positive). It then checks if the balance falls below 0 at any point, indicating a deficit. If the balance ever goes negative, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance going negative, it returns `False`.

The function outputs `False` if the account balance never falls below zero after applying the operations. It returns `True` if the account balance goes below zero at any point during the operations. This functionality is illustrated through test cases in the original problem statement.
