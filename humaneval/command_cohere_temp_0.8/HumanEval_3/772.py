```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, representing deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. It keeps a running balance and checks whether the balance falls below zero at any point in the operations. If the balance ever goes negative, it returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`. The function is designed to work with both positive and negative numbers, allowing it to handle scenarios where withdrawals exceed deposits. 

Here is an example usage of the function to test its functionality:
```python
# Test the function with positive operations
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # Expected output: False

# Test the function with mixed operations
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Expected output: True

# Test the function with multiple negative operations
print(below_zero([-2, -3, 4, -1, 2]))  # Expected output: True

# Test the function with only negative operations
print(below_zero([-5, -10, -20]))  # Expected output: True
``` 

The function should return `False` for the first test case, `True` for the second and third test cases, and `True` for the fourth test case.
