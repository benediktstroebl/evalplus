```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if at any point the balance of operations falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function increments the `balance` parameter with each operation in the list, and checks if it becomes negative at any point. The `typing` import adds type checking to the function and makes the code more readable and maintainable.

This solution works correctly for the provided test cases, hence it passes the regression tests. I hope this helps!
