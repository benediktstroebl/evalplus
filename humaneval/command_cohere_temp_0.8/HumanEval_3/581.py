```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each value in the input list. It simulates a bank account where each item in the list can be either a deposit or withdrawal, represented by positive or negative integers, respectively. It keeps a running total of these operations to simulate the current balance of the account.

The function returns `True` immediately if the balance drops any point below zero, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once. If the balance never falls below zero, it returns `False` at the end of the loop. 

This solution is efficient, with a time complexity of `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input list `operations`, since it checks all the operations sequentially and maintains the state of the balance.
