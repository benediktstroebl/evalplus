```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The function monitors the balance of the account and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, indicating a deficit. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This solution uses a simple loop to iterate through each operation in the input list. It updates the account balance by adding (for deposits) or subtracting (for withdrawals) the value of each operation from the current balance. If at any point the balance becomes negative (falls below zero), the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once during the sequence of operations. If all operations are non-negative, the balance will remain or become positive, and the function will return `False` at the end of the loop.
