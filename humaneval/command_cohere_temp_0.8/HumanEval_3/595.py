```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after executing a series of deposit and withdrawal operations represented by the `operations` list.

The function iterates through each value in the `operations` list, adding each operation to the current balance. If at any point the calculated `balance` falls below zero, it implies there is a negative balance, and the function returns `True`. If the balance remains non-negative throughout all operations, the function returns `False`, indicating that the balance never fell below zero. 

This solution adheres to the problem's specifications and provides the expected output for the test cases mentioned in the prompt. It does so in a concise and readable manner.
