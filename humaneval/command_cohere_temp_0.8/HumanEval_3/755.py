```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `List[int]` and returns a boolean value of `True` if the balance of operations falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. It achieves this by iterating through each operation in the list and accumulating them into a running balance. If the balance ever drops to a negative value, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the operation list. 

This solution adheres to the problem's prompt regarding the need to handle a list of operations and provides a straightforward way to check for the scenario of the account balance falling below zero at any point.
