```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `List[int]` and calculates the net balance of the bank account after each operation. If the balance ever falls below zero, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function works correctly as described in the problem statement.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
The first example of the usage of the function returns `False` because the list of operations `[1, 2, 3]` results in a positive balance of 2 after 3 operations. The second example returns `True` because the list of operations `[1, 2, -4, 5]` results in a negative balance of -2 after 4 operations. 

This script passes the given tests and solves the problem syntactically and functionally correctly.
