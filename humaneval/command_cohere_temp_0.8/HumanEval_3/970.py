```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The task is to determine whether the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

The function sets the initial balance to zero and then iterates through each element in the `operations` list. It updates the balance by adding the value of each operation to it. If at any point the balance becomes less than zero, it implies that the account balance has fallen below zero, and the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero during the given operations. 

This approach ensures that the function promptly returns `True` if the account balance ever breaches zero or falls into a negative range, and `False` if it does not. It gracefully handles the scenario of negative balances and provides a straightforward answer to the problem statement. 

The script passes the provided tests, as it correctly identifies that the account balance fell below zero in the second test case ([1, 2, -4, 5]) and returns `True`, while it returns `False` in the first test case ([1, 2, 3]).  This demonstrates the functionality and correctness of the `below_zero` function in solving the problem.
