```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The purpose of this function is to determine whether the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

The function starts by initializing the balance of the account to zero. It then iterates through each element in the `operations` list. For each operation, it adds the operation's value to the current balance. If the balance becomes negative at any point (meaning there is a net withdrawal amount greater than the initial balance), the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the balance fell below zero at least once. If the loop completes without the balance ever falling below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the balance never fell below zero throughout the sequence of operations.

This solution is efficient because it uses a single loop to process the operations and updates the balance accordingly. It provides a straightforward way to determine whether the account balance ever falls below zero, without the need for additional complexity like recursion or dynamic programming. 

The given tests demonstrate the proper functionality of this code, confirming that it accurately detects when the balance falls below zero and returns the correct boolean values for the given input scenarios.
