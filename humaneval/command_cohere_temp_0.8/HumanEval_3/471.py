```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function iterates through the list of `operations`, summing them to the `balance`. Whenever the `balance` falls below zero, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop if the `balance` remains non-negative. 

This solution follows the instructions in the markdown code block and ensures a correct detection of falling below zero balance. 

Note: the above solution is compatible with Python 3 due to the use of the `typing` module. If you're using Python 2, consider using the `types` module instead of `typing`.
