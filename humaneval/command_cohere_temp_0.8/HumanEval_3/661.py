```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function iterates through the list of `operations`, summing them to the running balance. Whenever the balance drops below zero, it returns `True`. If no such dip occurs, it returns `False` once it's finished iterating through the sequence of operations. 

This approach takes advantage of the explicit emphasis on declarative coding principles present in Python, particularly through its utilization of the 'type hint' feature from Python 3.9 and onwards. This feature allows for the creation of robust and clear codes, which in turn makes debugging easier and helps reduce runtime errors. 

This solution is efficient and straightforward, correctly solving the problem in a concise manner.
