```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after executing a series of deposit and withdrawal operations represented by the `operations` list.

The function starts by initializing the balance to zero and then iterates through each element (operation) in the input list. It updates the balance by adding the effect of each operation (deposit or withdrawal) to the current balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it implies there is a withdrawal that exceeds the available balance, and the function returns `True`. If the balance remains non-negative after processing all operations, it returns `False`. 

This solution is encapsulated in a self-contained Python function, which can be imported and used anywhere else in Python scripts. Furthermore, the function's behavior is clearly defined by its type annotations and docstring, which also provide information about the expected input and its purpose, making it accessible to developers who may read or use this code in the future.
