```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers `operations` as input. It simulates the operations on a bank account, starting with a zero balance. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates the balance of the account. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, it returns `False`.

The function is tested with examples that correspond to the provided test cases:
```python
def test_below_zero():
    # Example 1: Should return False
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False

    # Example 2: Should return True
    assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True

    # Edge case: Single operation
    assert below_zero([-10]) == True

    # Edge case: No operation
    assert below_zero([]) == False

``` 
This test suite verifies the function's behavior against different scenarios.
