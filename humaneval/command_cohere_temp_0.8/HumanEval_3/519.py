```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and simulates the effect of those operations on a bank account's balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it returns `True`, indicating that the account's balance went negative at some point. If none of the operations cause the balance to go negative, it returns `False`. The function uses a simple simulation and does not check for duplicate or consecutive negative numbers, so it may be prone to false positives.  It is self-contained and can be executed directly in Python, and can be copied and pasted into a Python environment or script to run independently.  It relies on Python's typing module for type hinting and helps promote code readability and maintainability.
