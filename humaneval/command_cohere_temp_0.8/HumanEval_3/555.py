```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the actions of these operations on a balance and checks if it falls below zero at any point. If the balance ever goes negative, it returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
# Test the function with a list of operations
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # Should print: False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Should print: True
``` 

This would output:
```
False
True
``` 

This indicates that the balance does not fall below zero with the first operation list but does with the second, which triggers the emergency funds release.  This function can be safely used to solve the given problem statement in a robust and efficient manner.
