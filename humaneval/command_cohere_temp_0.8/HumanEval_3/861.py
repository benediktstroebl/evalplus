```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function iterates through each operation in the list, updating the balance as if each operation were executed in sequence. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it indicates that the account balance became negative at some point, and the function returns `True`. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, it returns `False`. 

The function is designed to efficiently handle the scenario without unnecessary complexity or excessive computational steps. It provides a straightforward and reliable solution to the problem as described. 

This solution is testable and supports test-driven development (TDD). You can write individual test cases with specific lists of operations and verify if the function returns the expected results for each scenario.
