```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). The function simulates the actions of these operations on a balance and checks if it falls below zero at any point. If the balance ever becomes negative, it returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Here is an example usage of the function showing that it returns `False` when the balance never falls below zero:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
```

And here is an example usage of the function showing that it returns `True` when the balance falls below zero:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
