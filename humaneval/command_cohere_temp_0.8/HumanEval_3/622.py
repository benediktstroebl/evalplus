```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and determines whether the balance of a bank account, initialized at zero, would fall below zero after executing all the given operations.

The function uses a simple loop to iterate through each operation in the input list. For each operation, it updates the current balance by adding the effect of the operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero (indicating a negative balance), the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at some point. If all operations are executed and the final balance is still non-negative, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero.

The script includes a type hint, specifying that the argument `operations` should be a list of integers, which is a common convention used in Python to provide documentation about the expected types of function arguments and return values. 

This function is designed to solve the problem statement and would pass the given tests. Let's break down the problem and the solution:
1. The problem statement begins by describing a list of operations, each of which represents either a deposit or withdrawal from an initially zero-balance bank account. The objective is to ascertain if the balance will ever drop to a negative level at any point due to these operations.
2. The Python function `below_zero` takes the list of operations as input and loops through each operation, cumulatively adding its effect to the starting balance of 0. The function evaluates to `True` immediately whenever the balance becomes negative, signaling that the balance fell below zero at least once. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account balance remained non-negative throughout the operations.

This solution efficiently solves the problem using a straightforward iteration and accumulation approach, avoiding any complex mathematical optimizations.
