```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). The function iterates through each operation in the list, simulating the effects on the account balance. It keeps track of the total balance and checks whether it falls below zero at any point. If the balance ever goes negative, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once. If no such instance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations. 

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem statement. It also follows Python's idiom of using `typing` to enable type-checking, which is beneficial for building more reliable and maintainable code.  This way, the function is more robust and provides a clear indication of the expected input.
