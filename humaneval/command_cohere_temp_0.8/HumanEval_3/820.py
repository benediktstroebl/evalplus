```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of integers `operations` as input, representing deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. It keeps a running balance and checks whether it goes negative at any point in the operations. If the balance falls below zero at any moment, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function is designed to efficiently handle the query and provide the desired outcome based on the input operations.  This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations given.
