```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point during the operations, and `False` otherwise. It uses a for loop to iterate through each operation in the list, and adds each operation to the running total `balance`. If at any point the `balance` is less than 0, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop when all operations have been processed.

Here is an example usage of this code:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
This example usage demonstrates the function's behavior correctly. It returns `False` in the first case because the balance never falls below zero, and returns `True` in the second case because the final balance is -1, which is below zero. 

This code is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you have outlined in the markdown code block. It can be executed directly in Python, and requires no external dependencies or modifications to run.
