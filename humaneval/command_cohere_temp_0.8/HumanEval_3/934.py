```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. The function initializes a variable `balance` to 0, which represents the balance of the bank account. It then iterates through each value in the input list `operations`, adding each operation to the balance. If the balance falls below 0 at any point, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once. If no negative balance is encountered, the function returns `False` at the end of the loop. 

Here is an example usage example of this code:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This example mirrors the usage examples given in the problem statement. 

This code solves the problem using a single pass through the operation list, directly tracking the account balance as it evolves through the list of operations. It achieves the desired result of detecting any moment where the balance falls below zero, without the need for additional data structures or complex calculations.
