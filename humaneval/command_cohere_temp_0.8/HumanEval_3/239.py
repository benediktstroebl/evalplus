```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after executing a series of deposit and withdrawal operations represented by the `operations` list.

The function proceeds by iterating through each value in the `operations` list. It updates the current balance by adding the effect of each operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it implies that there is a negative balance, and the function returns `True`. If the entire list is processed without the balance dropping to zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the balance never fell below zero during the sequence of operations. 

This solution is concise and directly iterates through the operations, making it efficient and easy to understand. It also doesn't require any additional modules other than the typing module, making it self-contained.
