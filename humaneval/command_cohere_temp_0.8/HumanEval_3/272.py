```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function iterates through the list of operations, accumulating the balance, and returns `True` immediately once the balance falls below zero. It returns `False` otherwise. This solution follows the Less Code, More Problems principle, where the essence of the problem is captured with less code, leaving the reader with a clearer and more intuitive path to understanding. 

This approach also aligns with the Single Responsibility Principle, as the function is responsible for solely assessing if the balance goes negative, without encompassing other potential functionalities.
