```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. 

The function iterates through each operation in the input list. It cumulatively sums the money on the account for each operation. If at any point the cumulative sum becomes less than zero, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once. If no such instance is encountered, it returns `False` as the account never fell into the red. 

This solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations given, as it iterates through the list once, and performs a constant time operation for summation and check for falling below zero.
