```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `List[int]` and calculates the descending sum of the operations list. It returns `True` if the balance goes below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. The function works correctly as described in the given test cases.
