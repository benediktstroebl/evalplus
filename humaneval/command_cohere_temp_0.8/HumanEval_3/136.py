```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a loop to iterate through the list of operations, keeping track of the current balance. If the balance falls below zero at any point, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop if the list of operations is provided.  This solution adheres to the problem's specifications and should work correctly for the given input.  It is concise, efficient, and easy to understand.
