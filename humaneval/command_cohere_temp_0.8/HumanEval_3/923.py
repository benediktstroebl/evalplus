```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if at any point the balance of operations falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function increments the `balance` parameter with each operation in the list, and checks if it is less than zero. If it is, the function returns `True`. If the balance is still zero after processing the entire list, the function returns `False`.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This example corresponds to the test cases provided in the problem statement. In the first case the balance is never below zero, and in the second case it goes negative with the `-4` withdrawal operation, so `below_zero` returns `True`.
