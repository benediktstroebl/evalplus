```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each value in the input list. It accumulates the balance as it iterates through the operations, and it determines whether the balance has dropped below zero at any point. If the condition is met, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False` at the end of the iteration. 

Here is an example usage of this code:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

This output is consistent with the provided example in the original problem description.
