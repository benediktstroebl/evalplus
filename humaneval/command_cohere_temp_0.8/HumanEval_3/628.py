```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function takes a list of operations, iterates through them, accumulates the balance, and checks if it goes negative at any point. It returns `True` if the balance falls below zero at any moment and `False` otherwise. 

This approach assumes that each operation in the list is either a deposit (positive integer) or a withdrawal (negative integer).

The function includes type annotations with `List[int]` to indicate that the input parameter `operations` is expected to be a list of integers. These annotations are useful for creating clear, readable code and facilitating code maintenance and understanding. 

The logic is encapsulated in a straightforward for loop, which makes the code clear and easy to understand, following the principles of Clean Code. 

This solution adheres to the given problem statement and test cases, achieving an accurate determination of whether the account balance falls below zero at any point in the sequence of operations.
