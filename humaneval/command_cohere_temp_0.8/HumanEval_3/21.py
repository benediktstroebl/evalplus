```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function iterates through the list of operations, summing them into a running balance. Whenever the balance drops below zero, it returns `True`. If no such dip occurs, it returns `False` at the end. 

This approach takes advantage of the stipulated order of operations in the prompt; the function needn't consider negative balances before the final balance point.
