```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. The function iterates through each value in the input list and simulates the effect of each operation on a bank account's balance. It keeps a running total of the balance, and if at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If no negative balance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of the loop. 

This solution is concise and efficient, capable of handling any list of operations without excessive computational complexity. 

This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where 'n' represents the number of operations in the input list. It performs a single pass through the input list, updating the balance for each operation.
