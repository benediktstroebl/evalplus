```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. It iterates through each value in the input list, simulating the effect of the corresponding operation on the account balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero (indicating a deficit), the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell into the red. 

Here is an example usage of the function showing that the function returns `True` for a case where the account balance falls below zero:
```python
>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

And here is an example usage of the function showing that the function returns `False` for a case where the account balance does not fall below zero:
```python
>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
```
