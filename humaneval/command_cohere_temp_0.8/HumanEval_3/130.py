```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It iterates through each operation in the list, updating the balance by adding or subtracting the value of the operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at some point. If no such instance is found, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations. 

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem statement. It also follows Python's philosophy of "simplicity, readability, and consistency of syntax."  By using the any() function, the code is succinct and achieves the desired outcome. 

This function can be used to test against any set of operations and return whether or not the balance will fall below zero. 

To use this code you can simply call the function with a list of operations you want to test against, here is an example:
```python
# Self-contained example
operations = [7, -5, 3, -10, 2]
print("Below zero:", below_zero(operations))  # Output: Below zero: True
``` 

This example will print `True` since the account balance will be negative after the fourth operation.  This is because the balance will become `-2` after the first three operations `7 + (-5) + 3 = 5` and then it will become `-12` after the fourth operation `(-10) + 2 (-7)`. 

You can also try this with other example operations to see if it returns the expected outputs.  For example, an operation list of `[1, 2, 3]` should return `False` and `[1, 2, -4, 5]` should return `True`.  This is documented in the original problem statement.
