```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates them into a running balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If the entire list is processed and the balance never falls below zero, it returns `False`. This solves the problem statement to detect if the balance falls below zero at any point.  This solution is efficient, linear time complexity, and does not require any additional libraries.  It completes the task described in the comment and produces the correct output for the provided test cases.
