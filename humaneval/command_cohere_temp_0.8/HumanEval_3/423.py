```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation represents a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money). The function initializes a variable `balance` to 0, and iterates through each operation in the input list. It updates the balance after each operation, and returns `True` immediately if the balance falls below 0 at any point, indicating that the account balance went negative. If the loop completes without the balance ever going negative, it returns `False`.

Here's an example of how you can test this function:
```python
# Test the function with a list of operations
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # Should print: False

print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Should print: True
``` 
This will output:
```bash
False
True
``` 
Here, the first test case should return `False` because the account balance never goes below zero with the given operations. However, in the second test case, the account balance falls below zero with the sequence of operations, so the function returns `True`.  This matches the expected behavior outlined in the original problem statement.
