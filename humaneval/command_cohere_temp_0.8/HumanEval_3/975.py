```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation representing a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money) on a bank account. The function calculates the net balance after each operation and checks if it falls below zero at any point. If the balance ever goes negative, it returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`.

The script includes a type hint, specifying that the variable operations contains elements of the integer type. Type hints are optional Python features that enhance code readability and provide better code documentation. 

This solution adheres to Python's style guidelines and best practices, making it readable and maintainable.  It is also concise and straightforward, making it easy to understand for other developers.
