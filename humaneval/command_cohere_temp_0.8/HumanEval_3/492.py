```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). The function simulates the progression of the account's balance after each operation and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This example corresponds to the test cases provided in the problem statement. In the first case the balance never falls below zero, and in the second case it goes negative in the third step, so `below_zero` returns `True`.  This function works as expected as long as the balance is computed correctly after each operation, and a threshold of zero is used to determine if the balance is "below zero."  This approach is straightforward and doesn't require complex data structures or additional variables.  It's concise and gets the job done, which makes it well-suited for solving this specific problem.
