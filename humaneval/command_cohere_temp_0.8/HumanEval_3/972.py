```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations `List[int]` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates them into a running balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the balance went below zero at least once. If the entire list is processed without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`.

This solution follows the original problem statement and provides an efficient way to determine if the account balance goes below zero during any part of the sequence of operations. 
Let me know if you would like me to explain any part of the solution or provide additional details.  Also, I am available to solve other challenges or write code for various purposes.
