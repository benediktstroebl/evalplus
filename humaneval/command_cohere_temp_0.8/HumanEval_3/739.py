```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation can be either a deposit or withdrawal of cash from an account). This function iterates through the list of operations, accumulating the balance, and checks whether the balance ever goes below zero. If it does, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

This problem can also be solved using recursion. Below is an example of a solution using recursion:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    def helper(o, b):
        if not o:
            return b >= 0
        b += o[0]
        return helper(o[1:], b) if b < 0 else helper(o[1:], b) or helper(o, b)
    return helper(operations, 0)
```

In this version, we define a helper function that takes in the current operation and the current balance and recursively checks for the condition.
