```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations `ops` as input. It iterates through each operation in the list and updates the balance by adding the operation value. If the balance falls below zero at any point, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at some point. If no such scenario is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations. 

This solution is efficient and has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations in the input list.
