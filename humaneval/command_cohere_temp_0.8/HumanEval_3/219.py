```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates them into a variable called `balance`. If at any point the `balance` falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went negative at some point. If no negative balance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of the loop when all operations are processed. 

This solution follows the given test examples provided in the markdown code block and should be sufficient to pass the corresponding tests.
