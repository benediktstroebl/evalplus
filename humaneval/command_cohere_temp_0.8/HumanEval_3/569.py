```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an operation on the account, such as a deposit or withdrawal. The task is to determine whether the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

The function starts by initializing the balance of the account to zero. Then, it iterates through each element in the `operations` list. For each operation, it adds the operation's value to the current balance. If the balance becomes negative (i.e., falls below zero) during this process, it means the account entered a negative balance at some point, and the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance ever falling below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account never had a negative balance during the sequence of operations. 

This solution follows the requirements and correctly solves the problem, given that the function only relies on the list of operations and the logic encapsulated within the loop, without needing any external state or additional variables.
