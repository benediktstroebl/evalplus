```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the progression of the account's balance after each operation and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It uses a `typing` list to allow for type-checking of the input parameter. 

To test this function, you can use the following CLI sessions:
```bash
$ python <<EOF
python
> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
EOF
``` 

The first example test passes a list of operations with positive values, and the function returns `False` since the account balance never falls below zero. The second test includes a negative value in the operations list, so the function returns `True` since the account balance becomes negative at some point. 

This code should serve as a clear and efficient solution for the problem provided.
