```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after executing a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. It does so in the following steps:
- The function initialize a variable `balance` to 0, which represents the initial balance of the account.
- It then iterates through each element `op` in the input `operations` list.
- For each operation, the balance is updated by adding the value of `op`.
- If at any point the `balance` falls below 0, it means there is a moment when the account balance was negative, and the function returns `True`.
- If the loop completes without the account balance dropping below zero, it means the account never fell into a negative balance during the given operations, and the function returns `False`. 

The expected output of this function depending on the given `operations` list is as follows:
- If the list contains only positive integers, such as `[1, 2, 3]`, the account balance will always be increasing, and the function will return `False`.
- If the list contains both positive and negative integers, such as `[1, 2, -4, 5]`, there will be a moment when the account balance will dip below zero (after subtracting $4), so the function will return `True`. 

This function utilizes basic dynamic programming to track the evolving account balance, providing a straightforward solution to the problem.
