```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (of type `List[int]`), and returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point in the operations, and `False` otherwise.

It achieves this by summing up the values of `operations` one by one and initialize the balance to 0. It returns `True` if the balance becomes negative at any point, and `False` otherwise. It should be noted that the function will not return `False` if the balance goes below zero at some point but returns `True` immediately once it goes negative.

The function is tested in the provided Markdown code block, with two test cases: one where the account balance never falls below zero (`below_zero([1, 2, 3])`) and another where it does (`below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])`). The function is designed to return `False` for the first case and `True` for the second case, which matches the expected behavior as described in the code block.  This approach has an advantage of efficiency since it checks the account balance only once against the zero threshold. Hence no need for multiple comparisons.
