```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It iterates through each operation in the list, updating the running balance by adding the value of the operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went negative at some point. If no such scenario is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations, implying that the account balance never went below zero. 

This approach is efficient and has a time complexity of `O(n)` since it processes each operation once, and the complexity of each operation is `O(1)`.
