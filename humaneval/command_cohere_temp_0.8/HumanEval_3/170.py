```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script introduces an iterative approach to account summing operations. Instead of using recursion, it employs a `for` loop to iterate through each operation. 

The method continuously tracks the account balance, updating it by the cost of each operation. Whenever the balance drops below zero, the function promptly returns `True`. If the balance is zero or positive, it continues to monitor until all operations are processed.

The function's concise, iterative style improves performance and simplifies debugging. It passed the test and fulfilled the problem statement, marking the scenario of the account balance falling below zero.  This approach provides a clean, efficient solution to the problem at hand.
