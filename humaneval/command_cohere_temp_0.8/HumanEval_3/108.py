```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each operation in the list. It accumulates the balance as it iterates through the operations. If the balance ever falls below 0, it immediately returns True, indicating that the balance went below zero at some point. If no such instance is found, it returns False at the end of the loop when all operations are processed.

This solution follows the intent of the problem statement and should produce the correct result for the provided test cases. 

You can test this solution by calling the function with different lists of operations and verifying the results.
