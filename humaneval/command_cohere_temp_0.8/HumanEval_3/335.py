```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input, simulating operations done on a bank account. It initializes the balance to 0, then iterates through each operation in the list, adding or subtracting value from the balance accordingly. If at any point the balance falls below 0 (indicating a negative balance), it returns `True`. If none of the operations cause the balance to go negative, it returns `False`. The function is designed to efficiently determine if the balance goes negative at any point without explicitly checking the balance after each operation.
