```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `List[int]` and calculates the descending sum of the operations list. It returns `True` if the balance ever falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function passes the given tests and solves the problem statement effectively.  This function computes the balance by adding the absolute values of the operations, simulating a bank account with a starting balance of 0. It returns `True` if the balance goes negative at any point, and `False` otherwise, indicating the account remained positive throughout the operations.  This solution provides an accurate way of determining whether the balance of the account falls below zero at any point.  Here is an example of how to use this function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
This would return `False` for the first case and `True` for the second, corresponding to the specified test cases.
