```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the actions of these operations on a balance and checks if it falls below zero at any point. If the balance ever goes negative, it returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Here is an example usage of the function showing that it passes the given tests:
```python
>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
If you would like to verify this solution further, you can try adding more test cases with diverse lists of operations and verify that the function`below_zero` returns the expected outputs. Feel free to ask any questions or further clarifications.
