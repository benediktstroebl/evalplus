```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point due to those operations, and `False` otherwise. It uses a for loop to iterate through each operation in the list, accumulating the balance as it goes. If at any point the balance is less than zero, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop if no such point is reached. 

This solution works successfully passes the tests provided in the prompt. Let me know if you would like me to break down the solution further or provide any additional assistance.
