```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of operations, predicted as `List[int]`. The function first sums up the deposits and withdrawals from the list, then it iterates through each operation and updates the balance accordingly. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Here is an example usage of this function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

This example corresponds to the test cases provided in the problem statement. In the first case, the list of operations is `[1, 2, 3]`, and the balance is incremented by 1, then by 2, and finally by 3, which results in a balance of 6, so `below_zero` returns `False`. In the second case, the list of operations is `[1, 2, -4, 5]`, the balance is first incremented by 1, then by 2, but then it's decremented by 4, and finally incremented by 5, resulting in a final balance of 3, which is below zero, so `below_zero` returns `True`.
