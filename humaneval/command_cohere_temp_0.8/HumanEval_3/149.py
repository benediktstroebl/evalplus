```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each operation in the list. It adds each operation to the balance which is maintained as a running total of all the operations. If the balance falls below 0 at any point, it immediately returns True, indicating that the balance went below zero. If the balance doesn't go below zero after processing all operations, it returns False.

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem statement provided. It also follows Python's idiomatic style and leverages typing for better code readability.
