```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `List[int]` and calculates the ending balance after each operation. If the balance goes negative at any point, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The script passes the given tests of returning `False` for the first test of `([1, 2, 3])` and returning `True` for the second test of `([1, 2, -4, 5])`. 
Here is the explained code:
- The code starts by importing the `List` module from the `typing` module. This is optional but recommended as it gives better feedback on the function signature. 
- The `below_zero()` function takes a list of operations as its argument. Each element in the list represents an operation done on a bank account, such as a deposit or withdrawal. The function scans each operation in order and accumulates the balance of the account. 
- The function works by maintaining a running balance, initially set to 0. It then iterates over each operation in the input list. For each operation, it adds the value of the operation to the current balance. This reflects the effect of the operation on the account balance. 

After each addition, the function checks if the new balance is less than 0. If this is the case, the function returns `True`, indicating that the balance of the account has gone below zero at least once. If the balance is never negative, the function returns `False` after processing all operations. 
- In the provided example tests, the function returns `False` when the account balance never drops below zero, even though there are positive operations. It returns `True` when there is a negative operation that makes the account balance go negative. This correctly identifies the scenario where the account balance falls below zero at some point during the sequence of operations. 
This function provides a clear and concise solution to the problem and demonstrates a basic example of using typing and list operations in Python.
