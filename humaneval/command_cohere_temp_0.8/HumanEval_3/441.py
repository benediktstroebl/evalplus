```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each operation in the list. It accumulates the balance as it iterates through the operations. If the balance ever falls below 0, it immediately returns `True`. If no such point is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of the operations list.

This solution follows the prompt's expected functionality, where it returns `True` for tests like `[1, 2, -4, 5]` and returns `False` for tests like `[1, 2, 3]`.
