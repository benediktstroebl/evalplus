```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an operation on the account, such as a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount.

The function starts with the initial balance of the account set to zero. It then iterates through each element in the `operations` list. For each operation, it updates the balance by adding or subtracting the operation amount, depending on whether it's a deposit or withdrawal, respectively.

The function checks after each operation if the updated balance is less than zero. If this condition is met at any point, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once during the sequence of operations. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, it returns `False`.

This functionality allows you to determine whether the account balance will ever be negative, which can be useful for detecting risky financial scenarios or preventing overdraft situations.
