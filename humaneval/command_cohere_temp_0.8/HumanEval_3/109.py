```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation representing a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money) on a bank account. The function iterates through each operation, accumulating them into a `balance` variable. If at any point the balance falls below 0, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at that point. If no such instance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end, assuming the account balance never went negative. 

This solution assumes that the input list of operations is valid and contains only positive or negative integers, as stated in the problem statement.
