```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates them into a running balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at that point. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, it returns `False`.

This solution follows the prompt's expected behavior and returns `True` for tests like `below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])` and `False` for tests like `below_zero([1, 2, 3])`.
