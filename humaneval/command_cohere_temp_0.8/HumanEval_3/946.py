```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of a bank account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after executing all the given deposit and withdrawal operations. It does so in the following ways:
1. **Type Annotation**: The function starts with a type annotation, indicating that the `operations` parameter is expected to be a list of integers (`List[int]`).
2. **Initialization**: The function initializes a variable named `balance` to $0. This variable will keep track of the current balance of the bank account throughout the execution of the operations.
3. **Loop**: The function then iterates through each element (`op`) in the `operations` list using a `for` loop. In each iteration, it adds the `op` value to the `balance` to simulate the effect of that operation on the account balance.
4. **Check Balance**: After adding the effect of each operation to the balance, the function checks if the `balance` is less than zero. If it is, this indicates that at some point the account balance fell below zero, and in this case, the function returns `True`. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, it returns `False`.

The function returns `True` if the balance falls below zero at any point in the given operations, and `False` otherwise. This behavior allows you to determine whether the account balance could go negative at any moment during the sequence of operations. 

This implementation is efficient because it processes the operations only once, making it suitable for large datasets without requiring excessive computational resources.
