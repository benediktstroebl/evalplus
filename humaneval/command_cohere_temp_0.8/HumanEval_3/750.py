```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each value in the input list. It simulates a bank account where each item in the list can be either a deposit (positive value) or a withdrawal (negative value). It keeps a running total of the balance, checking at each step if the balance goes negative, and returns `True` if it does. It returns `False` at the end if the balance was never negative. 

The function is designed to work correctly with any list of operations, whether they are all deposits or withdrawals or a mix of both, and whether they are in a particular order or not. 

This solution makes use of Python's strong typing and type inference system, using the `List[int]` annotation to indicate that the function takes a list of integers as input. 

This approach allows the function to be used more generically and can handle a variety of different use cases without being explicitly coded, making it more adaptable and maintainable.
