```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations, where each operation can be either a deposit (positive integer) or a withdrawal (negative integer) from the bank account. The function initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each operation in the list. It updates the balance by adding the effect of each operation, and checks if the balance falls below 0 at any point. If it does, the function returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the operations list. 

Here is an example usage output:
```
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 

The function passes the provided example tests and solves the problem accordingly.
