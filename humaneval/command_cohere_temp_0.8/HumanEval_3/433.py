```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and determines whether the balance of a bank account, initially set to zero, falls below zero at any point during a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. The function iterates through each operation in the input list, adding or subtracting the value of each operation from the current balance. If at any point the balance becomes negative, indicating a deficit, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once. If no such negative balance is encountered, the function returns `False` at the end of the loop when all operations have been processed. This code efficiently solves the problem by directly manipulating the in-memory integer balance and returning a boolean result without introducing any unnecessary complexity.
