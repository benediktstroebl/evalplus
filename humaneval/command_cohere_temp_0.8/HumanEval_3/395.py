```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and checks whether any point the balance of operations will be below zero or not. The function loops through the operations and accumulates the balance accordingly. Whenever the balance goes negative, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the operations if the balance is still zero. 

Here is an example:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
This will return `False` for the first case and `True` for the second one, which is correct based on the test cases provided in the original prompt.
