```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script introduces an iterative approach to evolving bank account balance based on the sequence of operations. With a balance initialization of zero, it processes each operation, cumulatively adding or subtracting to the balance. Once the balance crosses the zero threshold, irrespective of whether it's from a negative dip or a rebound from a positive peak, the function promptly returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero. 

The function's initializing balance and iterative style guarantee that no matter the order or positivity of the operations, if the account balance ever dips below zero, it will return `True`. 

This methodology empowers the function to adeptly tackle various test cases, substantiating its efficacy. 

This approach ensures that the function can handle different permutations of the operations list and still correctly determine whether the balance goes below zero or not.
