```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (i.e., deposits and withdrawals) on a bank account. It iterates through each operation in the list, accumulating the effect of each operation on the balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero. 

This solution is efficient because it uses only a single pass through the input list and has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list. 

The function returns a boolean value, which is a truthy value (True) if the account balance ever falls below zero, and falsy value (False) otherwise. This is achieved using Python's boolean evaluation rules, where any non-zero number and empty list are considered truthy, and zero and None are considered falsy.
