```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations `List[int]` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates them into a running balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went negative at some point. If no negative balance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of the loop when all operations are processed. 

This solution follows Python's idiomatic style and utilizes type hints for improved readability and maintainability. Additionally, the function is designed to have a singular purpose, which enhances its overall clarity and cohesion. 

This approach allows for a concise and readable solution to the given problem statement.
