```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each value in the input list. It simulates a bank account where each item in the list can be either a deposit or withdrawal, increasing or decreasing the balance respectively. After each iteration, it checks if the balance falls below 0, and if so, it returns `True`. If such a point is not reached, it returns `False` after processing all operations.

Here is an example usage of this function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

This would return `False` for the first example because the balance never drops below zero. For the second example, the balance goes negative after subtracting 4 from it, so it returns `True`. 

This function successfully addresses the task outlined in the problem and produces the correct output for the given test cases.
