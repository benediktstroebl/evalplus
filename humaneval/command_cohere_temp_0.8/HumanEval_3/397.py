```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` on a bank account and returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. It achieves this by iterating through each operation in the list and updating the account balance accordingly. If the balance ever drops to a negative value, the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, it returns `False`. 

This solution follows the prompt's expected functionality, where it returns `True` for tests like `[1, 2, -4, 5]` and returns `False` for tests like `[1, 2, 3]`.
