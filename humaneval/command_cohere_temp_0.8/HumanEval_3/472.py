```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function iterates through the list of operations, accumulating a balance as it goes. Whenever the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If the end of the operation list is reached without breaching zero, it returns `False`. 

This approach takes advantage of short-circuit evaluation in Python to exit the function as soon as the condition is triggered. Thus, there's no need for an explicit `return False` at the end of the function. 

The function is designed to handle any number of operations, including zero.

If you're to incorporate tests into a Python file, you would typically use `unittest` for structured testing. The following is an example of how to use `unittest` to test the `below_zero` function:
```python
import unittest
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False

class TestBelowZero(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_single_positive_op(self):
        self.assertFalse(below_zero([1]))

    def test_single_negative_op(self):
        self.assertTrue(below_zero([-10]))

    def test_mixed_ops(self):
        self.assertTrue(below_zero([1, -2, 3, -4, 5]))

    def test_multiple_positive_ops(self):
        self.assertFalse(below_zero([10, 5, 20]))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This test suite defines four test cases, testing various scenarios: a single positive operation, a single negative operation, mixed operations, and multiple positive operations. 

The `unittest.main()` function is essential as it executes the tests whenever the script is run directly. 

To run this file, save it with a `.py` extension (e.g., `test_below_zero.py`). Then, navigate to its directory in your terminal and run:
```bash
python test_below_zero.py
```

The `unittest` framework is a powerful tool for creating robust test suites that can greatly simplify the process of testing and validating your code. 

I hope this detailed explanation helps you understand how to solve the problem and how to properly test the solution, pacing you well in your coding journey.
