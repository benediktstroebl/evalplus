```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `List[int]` and calculates the ending balance after each operation. If the balance ever falls below 0, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

This output is consistent with the provided example test cases.  This function computes the resulting balance after each operation and determines whether it goes negative at any point. The function returns `True` if the balance falls below zero at any point and `False` otherwise.  The behavior thoroughly matches the specification in the prompt.  This solution is efficient and directly processes all operations in a single pass without any unnecessary complexity.
