```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates them into a running balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If no such instance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations.

This solution is concise and directly iterates through the operations to determine if the balance falls below zero at any point. It effectively captures the essence of the problem statement and provides the desired output.
