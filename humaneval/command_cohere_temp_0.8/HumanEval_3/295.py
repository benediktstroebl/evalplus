```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function iterates through the list of `operations`, summing them to the `balance`. If the `balance` falls below 0 at any point, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the iteration if the `balance` remains non-negative. 

This solution follows the prompt's expectations as it correctly identifies scenarios where the balance falls below zero.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where 'n' is the number of operations in the input list. It does not depend on the values of the inputs in the list, but rather the number of operations given.
