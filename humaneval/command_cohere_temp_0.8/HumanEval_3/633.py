```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. The function initializes a variable `balance` to 0, which represents the balance of the bank account. It then iterates through each element `op` in the input list of operations.

For each operation, it adds the operation's value to the current balance. If the new balance becomes less than 0 (meaning there's a negative balance), the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at some point during the operations.

If the loop completes without the account balance falling below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero during the given operations.

This solution is efficient because it uses a single pass through the operations list and directly updates the balance variable, without the need for additional data structures.
