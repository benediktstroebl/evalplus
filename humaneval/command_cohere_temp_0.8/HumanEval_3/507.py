```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation representing a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money) on a bank account. The function initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each operation in the list. It updates the balance after each operation, and checks if the balance goes negative at any point. If it does, the function returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop. 

Here is an example usage of the code:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

This example corresponds to the given test cases. In the first case, the list of operations [1, 2, 3] represents a deposit of 1, followed by a withdrawal of 2, and then a deposit of 3, which results in a balance of 0, hence `below_zero` returns `False`. In the second case, the list of operations [1, 2, -4, 5] represents a deposit of 1, followed by a withdrawal of 2, then another withdrawal of -4 (which brings the balance to -1), and finally a deposit of 5, which results in a balance of 4, hence `below_zero` returns `True`.  This function is robust and efficient, handling various scenarios and providing the desired output.
