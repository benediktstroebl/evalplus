```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `List[int]` and returns a `bool`. It simulates a bank account where each element in the list is either a deposit or a withdrawal of `x` dollars. The function iterates through each operation, accumulating the balance, and returns `True` if the balance ever falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

This problem can be solved in many other ways, if desired, and the code can be optimized for different types of lists. Please let me know if you'd like any clarification on any parts of the solution or underlying concepts. I'm happy to elaborate on any of the points above, or delve into other potential solutions or related topics.
