```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). The function simulates the effects of these operations on a bank account starting with a balance of 0. It iterates through each operation in the input list and accumulates the total effect on the account balance. If at any point the balance falls below 0, it indicates a deficit, and the function returns `True`. If the balance remains non-negative after processing all operations, it returns `False`. 

The function's behavior is demonstrated and tested using example operations in the docstring.
