```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It simulates the actions on the account by updating the balance after each operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went negative at some point. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end. 

This solution adheres to the problem statement and provides an efficient way to determine if the account balance goes below zero at any point. 

This code snippet can be executed directly in Python, and it will output `True` or `False` depending on the given input.
