```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function iterates through the list of `operations` and simulates the effect of each operation on the account balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`. This solution follows the descriptive context-free grammar given in the problem statement.

Here is some additional test cases to further validate the function:
```python
# Test case from the problem statement
assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False

# Test case from the problem statement
assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True

# Boundary test, balance goes below zero due to first operation
assert below_zero([-1]) == True

# Boundary test, balance stays non-negative throughout
assert below_zero([1, 2, 3, 4]) == False

# Test a large number of operations
assert below_zero([1] * 10000) == False

# Test a mix of positive and negative operations
assert below_zero([1, -2, 3, -4, 5]) == True
``` 
You can copy and paste these test cases into a separate Python environment to comprehensively validate the function.
