```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function iterates through the list of operations, accumulating the balance while keeping track of the sign. If the balance drops to negative at any point, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False` at the end.  This approach is efficient and directly solves the problem statement.
