```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The task is to determine whether the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

The function sets the initial balance to zero and then iterates through each element in the `operations` list. It updates the balance by adding the value of each operation (deposit or withdrawal) to the current balance. After each operation, it checks if the balance is less than zero. If the balance is negative at any point, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once during the sequence of operations. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, it returns `False`.

This solution is concise and directly answers the problem statement, providing a boolean result based on the sequence of operations provided. It is also worth noting that this solution uses type hints with the `List` annotation to provide better clarity and possibly better code suggestion from the IDE when working with collections. 

This code can be tested directly in Python using the built-in `unittest` module or an IDE that supports testing like this:
```python
import unittest

class TestBelowZeroFunction(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_below_zero_true(self):
        self.assertTrue(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))

    def test_below_zero_false(self):
        self.assertFalse(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))
```
