```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after executing a series of deposit and withdrawal operations represented by the input list.

The function utilizes a simple loop to iterate through each operation in the input list. For each operation, it updates the current balance by adding or subtracting the value of the operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it implies that there is a moment when the account balance became negative, and thus, the function returns `True`. If no such moment is encountered, the function returns `False`.

This approach ensures that the function accurately detects whether the balance falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations, making it a straightforward and efficient solution to the given problem.
