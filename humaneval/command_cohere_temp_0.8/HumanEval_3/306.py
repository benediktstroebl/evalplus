```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The task is to determine whether at any point the balance of the account falls below zero, and if so, the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False`. 

The function updates the balance by adding the value of each operation, and if at any point the balance becomes negative, it immediately returns `True`. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, it returns `False`. 

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```python
# Test the function with two examples and validate the test cases
assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
``` 

These test cases validate the correctness of the `below_zero` function against the expected True and False outcomes.
