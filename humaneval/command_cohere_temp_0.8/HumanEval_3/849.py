```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, representing deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. It iterates through each operation in the list, updating the balance by adding or subtracting the operation amount. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If no such instance is found, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations. 

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem using basic Python syntax and logic, making it easily understandable.
