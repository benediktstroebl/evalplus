```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and then iterates through each value in the input list. It adds each operation to the running balance, and if the balance ever falls below 0, the function immediately returns `True`. If the balance remains positive throughout all operations, it returns `False` after processing all values.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

The first call shows the function returning `False` because the balance is never zero, and the second call shows the function returning `True` because it falls below zero due to the negative `(-4)` operation.  This function is designed to provide a clear and concise way to determine whether a sequence of operations could result in a negative balance.
