```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if at any point the balance of operations falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function increments the `balance` variable with each operation in the list, and checks if it is less than zero. If it is, the function returns `True`. If the balance never falls below zero, it returns `False`. This matches the specified behavior in the prompt. 

Here is an example usage of the function with a passing case:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
```
And here is an example usage of the function with a failing case:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This shows that the function correctly identifies cases where the balance falls below zero. 

If you would like to test this function on more cases, you can add additional `assert` statements containing specific operations lists and the expected `below_zero` output.
