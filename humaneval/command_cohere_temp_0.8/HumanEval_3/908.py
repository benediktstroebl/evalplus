```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. It iterates through each value in the input list and simulates the effect of the operation on the account balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`. 

This solution adheres to the problem's instructions and provides the intended behavior. It can be tested directly in Python, and it also passes the tests provided in the original problem statement.
