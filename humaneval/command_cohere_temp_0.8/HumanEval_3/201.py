```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an operation on the account, such as a deposit or withdrawal. The purpose of this function is to determine if the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

The function starts by initializing the balance of the account to zero. Then, it iterates through each element `op` in the input `operations` list. For each operation, it updates the balance by adding the effect of that operation (positive for deposits, negative for withdrawals) to the current balance.

If at any point the updated balance becomes less than zero, it means the account balance has fallen below zero, and the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the bad condition has been met. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account never fell into a negative balance during the sequence of operations.

The function returns either `True` or `False` depending on whether the account balance drops below zero at any point during the given operations. This can be tested using the provided examples in the Problem Description as well.
