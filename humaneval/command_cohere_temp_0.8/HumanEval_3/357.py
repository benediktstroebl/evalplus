```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function iterates through each operation in the list, updating the balance by adding the effect of each operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at some point. If none of the operations cause the balance to go below zero, it returns `False` at the end. 

This solution is succinct and correctly solves the problem statement. 

You can test this script by calling the function with different lists of operations and verifying the output against the problem statement. 

For example: 
```python
# Test case 1
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # Expected output: False

# Test case 2
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Expected output: True
``` 
The script would yield the following output:
```
False
True
``` 
This demonstrates the correctness of the `below_zero` function in solving the problem.
