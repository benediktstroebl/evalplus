```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, representing deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. It iterates through each operation in the list, accumulating the balance of the account. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero. 

This solution is concise and straightforward, only requiring a list of operations and a few lines of code to determine if the balance ever falls below zero.  This function is self-contained, easy to understand, and follows the expected functionality based on the test cases provided.  It should be able to handle any valid input of operations that are integers and successfully identify if the balance goes negative at any point.
