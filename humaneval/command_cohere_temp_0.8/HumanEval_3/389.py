```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The task is to determine whether at any point the balance of the account falls below zero, and if so, the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False`. 

The function updates the balance by adding the value of each operation, and if at any point the balance becomes negative, it immediately returns `True`. If the balance never falls below zero, it returns `False` once all operations have been processed. 

This solution follows the specified problem guidelines and will return the correct result for the provided example test cases, which is `False` for `[1, 2, 3]` and `True` for `[1, 2, -4, 5]`. 
If you have additional test cases or need further assistance, let me know!  It helps to include test cases to ensure we're meeting your specific requirements.
