```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (where each element represents a deposit or withdrawal from the account) and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. 

The function iterates through each operation in the list, updating the running balance by adding the value of each operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`. 

This solution is efficient, with a time complexity of `O(n)` since it iterates through the list of operations only once.
