```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the actions of these operations on a bank account balance and checks if the balance ever falls below zero. If it does, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

This solution makes use of Python's strong typing and type inference system, using the `List[int]` annotation to indicate that the `operations` parameter should be a list of integers. 

This approach allows us to iterate through the list of operations, accumulating the effect on the balance, without the need for a separate loop to check if the balance is negative. It also ensures that the function is well-defined and can handle any input that meets the `List[int]` specification, providing correctness and flexibility at the same time.
