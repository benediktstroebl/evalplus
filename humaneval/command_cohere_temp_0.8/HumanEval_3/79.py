```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It calculates the balance by summing up the operations, then iterates through each operation in the list, adding them to the balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If no such instance is found, it returns `False` at the end of the loop when the balance is still non-negative. 

This approach ensures that as soon as the account balance becomes negative, the function returns the desired output without needing to iterate through the entire list. Thus making the function efficient and avoiding any time complexity issues.  The code is also type-safe thanks to the use of the `typing` module. 

The unit tests provided in the problem prompt would correctly pass with this given solution.  ```python
test_below_zero():
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
    assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
```
