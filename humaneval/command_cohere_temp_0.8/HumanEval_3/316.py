```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function iterates through the list of operations, summing them into a balance. When the balance dips into the negative, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end. This algorithm is concise and easy to understand.  It avoids unnecessary complexity and is thus efficient and scalable, making it suitable for real-world applications.
