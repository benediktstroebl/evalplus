```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and tests if any point the balance of operations result in a negative number. The function uses a simple loop that iterates through each operation, adding them to the balance. If the balance is less than zero, it returns True, otherwise, it returns False. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
The example usage demonstrates the function's behavior, specifically, the first example shows the function's return falling false whereas the second example demonstrates the function returning true.
