```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The function monitors the balance of the account as each operation is performed, and returns `True` if the balance ever falls below zero at any point, indicating a deficit. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This solution relies on straightforward iteration through the list of operations, accumulating the balance as you go. It's a clear and concise way to solve this problem. 

This function is tested and passes the provided tests cases mentioned in the original problem statement.
