```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). It iterates through each operation in the list, updating the balance by adding the operation's value. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it indicates a deficit, and the function returns `True`. If the balance remains non-negative throughout all operations, it returns `False`, indicating that the account never fell into a negative balance. This function provides a logical way to check whether an account can go into a deficit state within a sequence of given operations. 

Here is an example of how to call the function:
```python
>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This will return `True` because the account balance falls below zero with the sequence of operations. 

This code snippet can be utilized as a standalone Python function that solves the problem defined in the Markdown code block and can be incorporated into larger programs to cater to similar problems.  It's also fully testable, making it robust and reliable within various contexts.
