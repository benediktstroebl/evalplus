```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It calculates the net balance of the operations and returns `True` if the balance ever falls below zero, indicating that the account is in debt at some point. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

The function uses a simple loop to iterate through each operation, accumulating the balance while checking if it crosses the zero threshold. This solution is efficient with a time complexity of `O(n)` since it checks each operation only once. 

It passes test cases as provided in the prompt, such as `below_zero([1, 2, 3])` returning `False` and `below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])` returning `True`.  This approach is concise and directly solves the problem using a simple loop and balance tracking.
