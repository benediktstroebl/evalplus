```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and determines whether the balance of a bank account, initialized at zero, would fall below zero at any point during the sequence of operations. The function iterates through each operation in the input list, adding or subtracting values from the running balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If no such point is reached, it returns `False` after processing all operations. The logic is implemented using a loop to simulate the effect of sequential operations on the account balance. 

Here is an example usage that demonstrates the functionality:
```python
# Test 1: Invalid Input
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False

# Test 2: Valid Input
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This shows the function's behavior when provided with valid and invalid inputs, where it correctly identifies the scenario where the balance falls below zero.  This solution is efficient and directly addresses the given challenge, making it optimized for practicality and readability.
