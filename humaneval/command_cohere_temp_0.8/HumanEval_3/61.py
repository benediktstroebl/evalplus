```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations on a bank account and returns `True` if the balance falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. The function iterates through each operation in the input list, accumulating a balance of the account as if these operations were executed in order. If at any point the calculated balance falls below zero, the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account never fell into a negative balance during the given operations. 

This solution is efficient since it has a time complexity of `O(n)` where `n` is the number of operations, it iterates through each operation once. Also, the space complexity is `O(1)`, which means that it doesn't require additional space for storing data apart from the input. 

This solution set covers the given test cases and provides an efficient way to determine if the balance of the account falls below zero during any point of the operations.  Let me know if you would like me to explain any part of the solution in more detail.
