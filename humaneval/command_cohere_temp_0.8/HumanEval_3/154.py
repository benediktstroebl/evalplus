```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of integers `operations` as input, representing deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. It keeps a running balance and returns `True` if the balance falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a simple loop to iterate through the operations, updating the balance as it goes, and returns the desired boolean value when appropriate.
