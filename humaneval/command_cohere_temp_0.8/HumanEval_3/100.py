```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation representing a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money) on a bank account. The function keeps a running balance as it iterates through these operations, and it returns `True` if the balance ever falls below zero at any point, indicating that the account is in a deficit. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

This example aligns with the given test cases, correctly indicating that the account balance will be negative at some point in the first example but not in the second.  This makes the `below_zero` function immediately useful for bank account simulations and other applications involving transaction lists.
