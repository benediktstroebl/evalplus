```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function increments a running balance by each operation in the input list. If at any point the balance is less than zero, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop if the operations list has no negative value.  This solution has a time complexity of O(n) since it iterates through each element in the operations list once.
