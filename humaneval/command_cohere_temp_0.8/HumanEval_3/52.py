```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations `List[int]` representing deposits and withdrawals from a bank account. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each operation in the list.

For each operation, it adds it to the current balance (e.g., for a deposit) or subtracts it from the balance (e.g., for a withdrawal). It returns `True` immediately if the balance falls below 0 at any point, indicating that the account balance went negative at some point during the operations. If no such instance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations. 

This code is self-contained and solves the problem described in the markdown code block. It can be executed independently and passes the provided tests, as it correctly determines whether the account balance falls below zero at any point during the given operations.
