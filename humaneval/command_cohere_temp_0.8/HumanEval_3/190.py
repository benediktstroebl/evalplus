```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The task is to determine whether the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

The function sets the initial balance to zero and then iterates through each element in the `operations` list. It updates the balance by adding the value of each operation (deposit or withdrawal) to the current balance. After each operation, it checks if the balance is less than zero. If the balance is negative at any point, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at some point during the operations. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, it returns `False`.

This solution is straightforward and efficiently determines whether the account balance falls below zero within the given set of operations. It is a clear and concise implementation in Python, utilizing type hints and a meaningful name for the function, which effectively communicates its purpose.
