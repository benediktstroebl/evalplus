```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of operations, predicted as `List[int]`. The function first initializes the balance of an account to zero and then iterates through the list of operations, each representing a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money. It adds or subtracts the operation amount from the cumulative balance. With each operation, it checks if the balance goes below zero. If this is the case, the function immediately returns `True`. If no negative balance occurs, it returns `False` at the end of the operations. 

Here is an example usage of this function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This would return `False` and `True` for the respective inputs. 

The function is designed to handle any list of operations, regardless of whether they are deposits or withdrawals or a mixture of both. 

If the balance goes below zero at any point in the operations, the function immediately returns `True`. If the balance remains non-negative throughout all operations, it returns `False` after processing all operations.  This behaviour allows the function to directly answer the question of whether the balance falls below zero at any point.  It could be the case that the list of operations is very long, but the function will still return `True` if the first encountered negative balance is sufficient to trigger the condition.
