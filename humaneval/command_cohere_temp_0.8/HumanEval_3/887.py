```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script introduces an iterative approach to simulate bank operations. Initially, the balance is set to zero. Then, it sequentially processes each operation, accumulating the effect (either addition or subtraction) on the balance. Once the balance drops to negative, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If no such instance is encountered, it returns `False` once all operations are processed. 

This approach provides a concise solution that effectively checks if the account balance falls below zero at any point, fulfilling the problem statement's requirements. 

The unit tests for this script would be: 
```python
def test_below_zero():
    # Test case where balance goes below zero
    assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True

    # Test case where balance remains positive
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False

test_below_zero()
``` 
These tests cover both scenarios, confirming the function's correctness.
