```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of a bank account, which starts at zero balance, can fall below zero after executing all the given deposit and withdrawal operations. It does so by iterating through each element in the input list, which represent bank account operations (either deposits or withdrawals), and simulates the effect of these operations on the account balance. After iterating through all operations, the function returns `True` if the account balance ever falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. This functionality allows you to predict whether the account balance could go negative at any moment during the sequence of operations, which is useful for detecting potentially illegal or incorrect transactions.
