```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation represents a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money) and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. 

The function iterates through each operation in the list, updating the balance accordingly. If at any point the balance becomes less than zero, it immediately returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop when all operations have been processed. 

This solution is efficient, low on memory usage, and correctly solves the problem without any extra variables that could potentially lead to bugs.
