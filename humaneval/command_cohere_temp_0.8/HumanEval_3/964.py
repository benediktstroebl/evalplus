```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation representing a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money) on a bank account. The function iterates through each operation, updating the balance and checking if it falls below zero at any point. If the balance ever goes negative, the function returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the operations list. 

This solution adheres to the given test cases mentioned in the problem and will correctly identify whether the account balance falls below zero at any time during the given operations.
