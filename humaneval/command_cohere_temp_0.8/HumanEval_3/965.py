```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the progression of the account's balance after each operation and checks if it falls below zero at any point. If the balance ever goes negative, it returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This solution makes use of Python's strong typing and type inference system, using the `List[int]` annotation to represent the list of operations and improve code readability and maintainability. 

This approach allows for a clear and concise implementation that elegantly solves the problem and achieves the desired result.
