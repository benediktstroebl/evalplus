```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and tests if any point the balance of operations result in a negative number. The function uses a simple loop that simulates the operations and checks if any of them result in a balance below zero. It returns `True` if the balance falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is an example usage of the function showing its behavior against two different tested cases:
```python
# Test Case 1
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: False

# Test Case 2
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Output: True
```
