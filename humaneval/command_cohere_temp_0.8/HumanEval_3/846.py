```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It calculates the balance by summing the operations, then determines whether the balance falls below zero at any point. If it does, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`. The function uses the `List[int]` type annotation to ensure that it accepts only lists of integers, which are the expected types of operations on a bank account. 

Here's an example usage:
```python
# Test with positive operations
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: False

# Test with negative operations
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Output: True
``` 

This script will print `False` for the first test case and `True` for the second test case, respectively, as they correspond to the provided example tests.  This function can be easily integrated into a broader banking system to check for negative balances and ensure the integrity of account balances.
