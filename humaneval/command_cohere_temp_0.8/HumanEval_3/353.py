```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations `List[int]` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and calculates the running balance of the bank account. If the balance ever falls below zero, the function immediately returns `True`. If the balance remains positive throughout the operations, it returns `False` at the end. 

This solution follows the prompt's expectations, as it returns `True` for tests like `[1, 2, -4, 5]` and `False` for tests like `[1, 2, 3]`.  This is because the former descends below zero with the withdrawal of `-$4`, whereas the latter continues to have a positive balance of `2` after the three operations.
