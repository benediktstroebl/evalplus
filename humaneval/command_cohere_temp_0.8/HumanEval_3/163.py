```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an operation on the account, such as a deposit or withdrawal. The task is to determine whether the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

The function starts by initializing the balance of the account to zero. Then, it iterates through each element `op` in the `operations` list. For each operation, it updates the balance by adding the effect of that operation (positive for deposits, negative for withdrawals) to the current balance.

Here's an example of how you can use the `below_zero` function with a sample input:
```python
# Test the function with a positive balance
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: False

# Test the function with a negative balance
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Output: True
```

This will return `False` for the first test case and `True` for the second test case, as expected, indicating whether the balance falls below zero during the sequence of operations.

This script effectively solves the problem using a straightforward approach, maintaining the account balance as it processes the operations and returning a boolean result based on the first instance of the balance falling below zero.
