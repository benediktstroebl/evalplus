```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code tracks the balance as it processes each operation in the list. If the balance ever drops below 0, the function immediately returns True, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at that point. If no such incident occurs during the iteration, the function returns False, indicating the account never fell into the red. 

This approach takes advantage of the short-circuit evaluation of Boolean expressions in Python. The code can quit immediately after detecting a balance below 0, without needing a flag or explicit tracking of such instances.
