```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. The function iterates through each value in the input list and accumulates them to a variable called `balance`, this represents the current balance of the bank account after each operation. Then, at the end of the loop, the function returns `True` if the balance has fallen below zero at any point in the operations, indicating that the account entered a negative balance. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Here is an example usage of the function from the specification:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
This example usage demonstrates the function's behavior accordingly.
