```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each value in the input list. It simulates a bank account where each item in the list can be either a deposit or withdrawal, represented by positive or negative integers, respectively. It accumulates the total effect of these operations on the balance.

Then, it checks if the balance ever falls below zero. If it does, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once. If no negative balance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of the loop. 

This function returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`) depending on whether the account balance falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations. 

Here is an example usage of the function to verify its correctness:
```python
>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
This example usage demonstrates the function's behavior, and the tests adequately prove its correctness.
