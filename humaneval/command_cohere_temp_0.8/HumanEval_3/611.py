```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and checks whether any point the balance of operations result in a value less than zero. 

The function loops through each value in the input list `operations`, it adds each operation value to a running balance. If the balance drops to a negative number at any point, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the balance went below zero at least once. If the entire list is processed and the balance never drops to negative, it returns `False`. 

This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where 'n' is the number of operations in the input list.
