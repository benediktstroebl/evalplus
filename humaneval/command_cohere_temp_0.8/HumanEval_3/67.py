```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function iterates through each operation in the list, updating the balance by adding the effect of each operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it indicates that the account balance went into a negative state at some point, and the function returns `True`. If the balance remains non-negative throughout all operations, it returns `False`. 

The function is designed to efficiently handle the scenario without requiring explicit tracking of the maximum depth or the generation of all possible intermediate balances, which can be computationally expensive for large operation lists. 

This solution relies on the straightforward approach of iterating through the operations and calculating the balance accordingly, making it intuitive and easily maintainable, especially for problems related to financial operations.
