```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the actions of these operations on a bank account starting with zero balance and checks if the balance ever falls below zero. If it does, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`. 

The function uses a loop to iterate through each operation in the input list. It updates the account balance by adding the value of each operation, and checks if the balance becomes negative at any point. If it does, the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns `False`. 

This solution follows the given test examples provided in the prompt and returns `False` for the first case and `True` for the second case. 
```python 
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
This code provides a clear and efficient solution to the problem using straightforward Python and core banking operations.
