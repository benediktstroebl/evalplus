```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function iterates through the list of operations, accumulating a balance, and returns `True` if the balance ever falls below zero, otherwise, it returns `False`.  This approach is straightforward and simple, leading to the expected results.  This solution utilizes a simple loop to iterate through the sequence of operations and assesses the final balance after looping through.  It is important to note that this approach has a time complexity of O(n) since it checks each operation in the list once.
