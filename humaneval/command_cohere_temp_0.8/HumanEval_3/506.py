```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of a bank account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after executing all the given deposit and withdrawal operations.

The function uses a simple loop to simulate the execution of operations one by one, updating the balance after each operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If all operations are executed and the balance remains non-negative, it returns `False`. 

This solution follows the guideline given in the problem statement, and the function can be directly used to test against the given cases.
