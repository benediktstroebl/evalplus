```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. It does so by iterating through each value in the input list and simulating the effect of each operation on the account balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This solution follows the problem statement and passes the tests provided. It is concise and uses a simple loop to iterate through the operations list and updates the balance accordingly.
