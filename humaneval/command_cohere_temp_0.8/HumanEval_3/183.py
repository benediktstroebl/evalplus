```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations `List[int]` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates them into a running balance using an initial balance of 0. It checks if the balance falls below zero at any point and returns `True` if it does, and `False` otherwise. The function returns the appropriate boolean value to indicate if the balance went negative at any point during the sequence of operations. 

Here is a simple test to validate the functionality of the function:
```python
def test_below_zero():
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
    assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
    assert below_zero([0, 0, 0]) == False
``` 
The test code illustrates the function's correctness with three assertions. The first assertion tests if the function returns `False` when the list contains only positive operations. The second assertion validates the function's behavior when the list contains one negative operation, returning `True`. The third assertion shows the function's accuracy when the list consists of zero operations.
