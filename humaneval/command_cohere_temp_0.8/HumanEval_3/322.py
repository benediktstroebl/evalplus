```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. 

The function iterates through each operation in the input list. It updates the running balance by adding the effect of each operation. If the balance drops to or below zero at any point, it immediately returns `True`. If no such drop occurs, it returns `False` at the end of the loop when all operations have been processed. 

This solution follows the specified requirement and corresponds to the provided test cases. Feel free to adapt and reuse this code as needed. Let me know if you have any other questions!
