```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after executing a series of deposit and withdrawal operations represented by the `operations` list.

The function iterates through each element of the `operations` list, adding each operation (deposit if positive, withdrawal if negative) to the current balance. If at any point the calculated `balance` falls below zero, it implies there is a moment when the account balance becomes negative, and the function returns `True`. If no such moment occurs after processing all operations, the function returns `False`. 

This solution is encapsulated and allows you to quickly determine whether the balance of the account described will dip below zero at any point.
