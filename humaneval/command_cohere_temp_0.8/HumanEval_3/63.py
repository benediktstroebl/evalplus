```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script introduces an iterative approach to account activity simulation and balance tracking. Within the loop, each operation is executed, and the balance is updated accordingly. Ultimately, the function returns True if the balance falls below zero at any point, and False if it successfully sustains a positive balance throughout all operations. 

This approach guarantees that the function accurately detects scenarios in which the account balance falls below zero, while efficiently addressing the problem within a single function.
