```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function iterates through the list of operations, accumulating the balance while keeping track of the ledger. If at any point the balance slips into the red, the function promptly returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end, indicating that the account remained in the positive territory throughout the operations. 

This approach is concise and elegant, immediately returning the result as soon as a negative balance is detected, without the need for explicit loops or conditional statements to handle all the possible cases.
