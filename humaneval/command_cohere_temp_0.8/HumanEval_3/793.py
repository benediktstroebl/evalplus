```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function returns True if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point after applying the given operations, and False otherwise.

The function uses a for loop to iterate through each element in the input list `operations`. It updates the current balance by adding the value of `op` and checks if the balance falls below zero. If this condition is met, the function returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, the function returns `False`.

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem statement in the markdown code block.
