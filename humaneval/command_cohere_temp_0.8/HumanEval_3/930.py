```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates them into a running balance using an initial balance of 0. It returns `True` immediately whenever the calculated balance falls below zero, indicating that the account balance went negative at some point during the operations. If no such negative balance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations. 

Here is an example usage output:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
