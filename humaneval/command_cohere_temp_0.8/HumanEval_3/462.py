```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function iterates through the list of operations, accumulating the balance, and returns `True` if the balance drops to zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is an example usage of this code:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This example mirrors the usage in the original problem description. The first example asserts that the balance will not fall below zero with the given list of operations, whereas the second example shows an example where the balance falls below zero, and the function returns `True`.
