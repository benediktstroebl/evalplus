```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and then iterates through each value in the input list. It assumes that each integer represents an operation on a bank account where a positive integer represents a deposit, and a negative integer represents a withdrawal. It keeps track of the balance as it iterates through the operations, adding deposits and subtracting withdrawals.

The function returns `True` immediately when the balance falls below zero at any point in the sequence of operations, indicating that the account balance went negative. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, it returns `False`. 

This solution is efficient in terms of time and space as it uses only a list of integers and a single variable to track the balance, and it only needs to iterate through the list once to determine the result.
