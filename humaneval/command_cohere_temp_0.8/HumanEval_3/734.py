```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The function's purpose is to determine whether the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

The function starts by initializing the balance of the account to zero. Then, it iterates through each element in the `operations` list. For each operation, it adds the operation's value to the current balance. If the balance becomes negative at any point (meaning there is a net withdrawal amount greater than the initial balance), the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the balance fell below zero at least once. If the loop completes without the balance ever falling below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the balance never fell below zero throughout the sequence of operations. 

This approach uses a simple iterative algorithm, where the loop iterates through the sequence of operations and updates the balance accordingly. The function returns the aforementioned boolean value based on whether the balance ever goes negative or not. 

The unit tests provided earlier verify the correct operation of this function with various scenarios, namely checking if it correctly identifies cases where the balance falls below zero and situations where the balance remains non-negative.  Overall, this solution provides a concise and efficient way to solve the problem using a single function, without the need for any additional variables or complex data structures.
