```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function iterates through each operation in the list, updating the running balance by adding the value of the operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at some point. If no such scenario is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations. 

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem statement. It also follows Python's style guidelines, such as using type annotations and explicit returning of variables. 

This code can be tested against the test cases mentioned in the problem statement like so:
```python
> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
These would return the expected outputs of `False` and `True` respectively, indicating the correctness of the function.
