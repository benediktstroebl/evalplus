```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and determines whether the balance of the bank account represented by these operations falls below zero at any point. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how this code works:
1. **Function Signature**: The function is defined as `below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool`, which means it takes a list of integer operations as its input and returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`) depending on whether the account balance falls below zero.
2. **Initialize Balance**: It starts with setting the balance of the account to zero. In an iterative manner it goes through each operation in the input list.
3. **Iterate Through Operations**: Using a loop, it iterates through each element in the `operations` list. For each operation, it adds it to the current balance to keep track of the account's balance after each operation.
4. **Check for Negative Balance**: It checks after each operation if the balance becomes negative. If at any point the balance is less than zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at that point.
5. **Completed Iterations**: If the account balance doesn't go negative throughout all the operations, it finishes the loop and returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero.

This function encapsulates the logic of the bank account scenario and provides the desired output based on the given description.
