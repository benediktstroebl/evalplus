```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and determines whether the balance of a bank account, initialized at zero, would fall below zero after executing all the given operations. It iterates through each operation in the input list, adding or subtracting them from the current balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If all operations are executed without causing a negative balance, it returns `False`. The function is designed to accurately detect whether the account balance would go negative at any point during the sequence of operations. 

Here is an example usage of this function to catch a below-zero balance for the given Operations:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
>>> below_zero([0, 2, 3, 4])
False
``` 
This example showcases the function's capability to detect occurrences where the balance falls below zero and then returns True, whereas in the latter case, it returns False as the balance doesn't fall below zero.
