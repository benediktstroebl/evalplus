```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations `ops` as input. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates them into a running balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If the entire list is processed without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero. 

This solution is concise and directly iterates through the operations to determine if the balance goes below zero at any point. It effectively demonstrates the core logic of the problem in a self-contained manner. 

This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations, as it performs a single pass through the operations list. It has an auxiliary space complexity of O(1), as it only maintains a single variable to keep track of the balance during the iteration.
