```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and checks whether any point the balance of operations result in a value less than 0. The function returns True if the balance falls below zero at any point, and False otherwise. It uses a simple loop to iterate through the operations and accumulates the balance by adding each operation. If the balance goes negative at any point, it returns True, and it returns False after processing all operations if the balance remained non-negative.  This approach ensures that the function is self-contained and can be executed directly from the Markdown code block provided.  This function is designed to pass both test cases mentioned in the specification.
