```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `List[int]` and returns a boolean value of `True` if the balance of operations falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. It achieves this by iterating through each operation in the list and incrementing the balance by the value of the operation. If the balance falls below zero at any point, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop when the balance is still non-negative.  This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list.  This is because the function iterates through each element in the list exactly once, performing a constant amount of work - assigning it to the balance, and checking if it goes below zero - for each element. 

Here is a simple test to validate the functionality of the function:
```python
def test_below_zero():
    # Arrange
    operations1 = [1, 2, 3]
    operations2 = [1, 2, -4, 5]

    # Act
    result1 = below_zero(operations1)
    result2 = below_zero(operations2)

    # Assert
    assert result1 == False
    assert result2 == True
``` 

This test validates the function's behavior against the problem statement's test cases.  The first operation list contains only positive integers, so the assert statement expects `False` as the result. The second operation list contains a negative integer which will make the balance go below zero, so the assert statement expects `True` as the result.  This test supports the definition of a functional `below_zero` function.
