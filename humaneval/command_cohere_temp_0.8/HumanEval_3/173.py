```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integer operations, representing deposits and withdrawals, on a bank account. It iterates through each operation in the list, simulating the effect of each action on the account balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went negative at some point. If no negative balance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations. 

This solution is concise and straightforward, and it correctly handles the scenario of a negative balance occurring at any point in the sequence of operations. 

This code can be tested like this:
```python
>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
These tests correspond to the example provided in the problem statement.
