```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function iterates through the list of operations, accumulating a balance as if it were a bank account. When the balance goes negative, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the operation list. 

Here is an example usage of the function from the markdown code block:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 

This should return the values False and True, respectively, which aligns with the original markdown problem statement.
