```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point in the operations, and `False` otherwise. It does so by maintaining a running balance as it iterates through the operations, and if at any point the balance slips into the negative, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end. 

Here is an example usage of the code:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

This example corresponds to the given test cases. The first example should return `False` since the balance is never below zero. The second example returns `True` because the balance becomes negative after the second operation.  This code should successfully pass the provided tests.
