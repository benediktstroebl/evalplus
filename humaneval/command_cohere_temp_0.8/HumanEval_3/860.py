```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, such as deposits and withdrawals, and determine whether the account balance falls below zero at any point.

Here's how the script works:
1. The function `below_zero` starts with a variable `balance` set to 0, representing the initial balance of the bank account.
2. It then iterates through each element (`op`) in the input list `operations`.
3. In each iteration, the current `op` is added to the `balance` to simulate the effect of that operation on the account balance.
4. If at any point the `balance` becomes less than 0 (indicating a negative balance), the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at some point.
5. If the loop completes without the account balance falling below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero.

The script includes a docstring with examples that demonstrate the behavior of the `below_zero` function. Specifically, it shows how the function would process two different sequences of operations, revealing whether the account balance fell below zero or not. These examples help users understand the purpose and correct functionality of the code.
