```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and then iterates through each value in the input list. It assumes that each integer represents an operation on a bank account where a positive integer represents a deposit, and a negative integer represents a withdrawal. It keeps track of the balance as it iterates through the operations, adding deposits and subtracting withdrawals.

The function returns `True` immediately when the balance falls below zero at any point in the operations list. If the balance never falls below zero, it returns `False` at the end of the operations list. 

Here is an example of how you can call this function:
```python
# Test the function
assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
```

This test case checks if the function returns `False` when the account never falls below zero and `True` otherwise.
