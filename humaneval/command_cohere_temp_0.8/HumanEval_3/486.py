```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and determines whether the balance of a bank account, which starts at zero balance, falls below zero at any point during the operations. 

The function iterates through each operation in the input list. It simulates the effect of each operation on the account balance, accumulating the sum of deposits and withdrawals. If at any point the calculated balance falls below zero, it indicates a negative balance, and the function returns `True`. If no negative balance is encountered throughout all operations, it returns `False`. 

This solution is concise and correctly matches the specified behavior of the problem.
