```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation represents a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money). The function initializes a variable `balance` to 0, and iterates through each operation in the input list. It accumulates the sum of operations in the `balance` variable. If at any point the balance goes negative, it indicates that the account balance fell below zero, and the function returns `True`. If no such occurrence is seen, it returns `False` at the end. 

This solution adheres to the explicit instructions in the prompt, where the function should return `True` if the balance falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. 

This approach is efficient and has a time complexity of `O(n)` since it checks each operation in the list only once. It is also worth noting that the function is designed to handle any kind of input with valid types, as it uses the `typing` library to declare the input type, allowing for strong type-checking.
