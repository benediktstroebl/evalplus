```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (of type `List[int]`), where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). The function iterates through each operation in the list, simulating the effect of each operation on the account balance. It keeps track of the balance as it progresses and checks whether the balance ever goes below zero. If it finds any such point, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once. If the loop completes without the balance ever going negative, it returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero. 

The function is designed to handle any list of operations and provides the resultant boolean output based on the provided conditions. 

This solution makes use of Python's strong typing and declarative nature, along with list comprehension and a simple loop for efficient and readable code. 

This approach allows for a clear and concise solution that handles a wide variety of cases. It avoids excessive complexity and ensures readability, following Python's philosophy of "readable is better than writable."
