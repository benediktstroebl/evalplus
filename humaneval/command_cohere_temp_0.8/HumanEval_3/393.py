```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function iterates through the list of operations, updating the running balance by adding each operation. If the balance drops to a negative value at any point, the function returns `True`. If the balance remains non-negative until the end of the operations, it returns `False`. 

Here is an example usage output:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
>>> below_zero([0, 0, 0, 0])
False
```

This generates the expected output of `True` for the first case and `False` for the second.  This function can be used to quickly and accurately determine whether any point in a sequence of operations results in a negative balance, providing a useful tool for analyzing bank account scenarios or other situations involving dynamic balances.  If you would like to test more cases, feel free to ask for further assistance.
