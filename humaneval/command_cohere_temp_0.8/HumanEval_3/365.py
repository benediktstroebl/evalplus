```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers `operations` as input. It simulates the operations done on a bank account, starting with a zero balance. It iterates through each element in the input list, representing deposit and withdrawal operations, and updates the current balance by adding the effect of each operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it indicates a deficit, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end if the sequence of operations resulted in a balanced or positive account. 

This solution adheres to the problem's prompt, where the function should return `True` if the balance falls below zero at any point and `False` otherwise. 

This approach is efficient as it uses only a single pass through the operations list and direct manipulation of the balance variable, thus ensuring a linear time complexity (`O(n)`).  This is irrespective of whether the input list is peppered with positive or negative integers, as the function merely needs to traverse them once to ascertain the outcome.
