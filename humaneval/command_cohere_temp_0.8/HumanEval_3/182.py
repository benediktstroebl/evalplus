```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, such as deposits and withdrawals, and determine if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point.

Here's how the script works:
1. The `below_zero` function takes a list of operations `[op1, op2, ...]` as input, where each `op` represents an operation performed on the bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal).
2. It initializes a variable `balance` to 0, which represents the initial balance of the account (initially $0).
3. Then, it iterates through each operation in the input `operations` list.
4. In each iteration, it adds the current `operation` to the `balance` to simulate the effect of that operation on the account balance.
5. If at any point the `balance` becomes less than 0 (indicating a negative balance), it means the account has insufficient funds, and the function immediately returns `True`.
6. If the loop completes without encountering a negative balance, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account's balance never fell below zero.

The script includes a docstring with example tests to demonstrate the behavior of the `below_zero` function. Specifically, it showcases how the function handles two different scenarios:
- `below_zero([1, 2, 3])` returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero with the given list of operations.
- `below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])` returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero due to the negative withdrawal of $4, and it fails the second test.

The script adequately addresses the problem of detecting whether the balance of a bank account, operated by a list of deposits and withdrawals, falls below zero at any point.
