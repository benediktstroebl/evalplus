```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the effect of these operations on a bank account starting with a balance of 0. It iterates through each operation in the input list and updates the balance accordingly. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it indicates that the account's balance became negative at some point, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, if the balance remains non-negative throughout all the operations, it returns `False`. 

The function is designed to efficiently handle the scenario of account balance going negative and provides the correct output for the given test cases. 

  ```python 
  >>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
  False
  >>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
  True
  >>> below_zero([-10, 0, 1])
  True
  >>> below_zero([-5, -10, -15, -20])
  True
  >>> below_zero([0, 0, 0, 0])
  False
  ``` 

You can use this function to test different scenarios of deposit and withdrawal operations and determine whether the account balance falls below zero at any point.
