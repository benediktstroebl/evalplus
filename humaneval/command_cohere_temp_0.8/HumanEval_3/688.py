```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation represents a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money) and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise.

The function iterates through each operation in the list. For each operation, it updates the balance by the amount of the operation. If the balance becomes negative at any point, it immediately returns `True`. If the end of the operations list is reached and the balance is still non-negative, it returns `False`. 

This solution is efficient because it uses a single pass through the input list and has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations in the list.
