```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if at any point the balance of operations falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function increments the `balance` variable with each operation in the list, and triggers a return of `True` whenever `balance` crosses the zero threshold, and `False` at the end of the loop if the threshold hasn't been crossed. 

To simulate test runs, you can use:
```python
> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
```

And
```python
> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

The provided examples demonstrate the function's behavior for the above zero and below zero scenarios respectively.
