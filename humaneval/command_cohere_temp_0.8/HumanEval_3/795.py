```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the effect of these operations on a bank account's balance and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It iterates through each operation in the input list, adding them to the running balance. If the balance ever becomes negative, it immediately returns `True`. If the end of the list is reached without the balance ever going negative, it returns `False`. 

This solution is efficiently implemented with a single pass through the input list and avoids any recursion or unnecessary complexity. 
```python
# Test Scenario 1
assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False

# Test Scenario 2
assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
``` 
This code block includes two test scenarios that demonstrate the function's behavior for different input lists, ensuring its correctness and robustness in response to these test cases.
