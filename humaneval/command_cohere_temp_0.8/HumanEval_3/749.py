```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `List[int]` and calculates the descending balance of the bank account through each operation. It returns `True` if the balance falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. The function accomplishes this by iterating through each operation in the input list and updating the balance accordingly. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
>> below_zero([0, 0, 0, 0])
False
``` 
This will return `True` for the first case, since the balance will be negative after the `-4` withdrawal operation, and `False` for the second case, as the balance never falls below zero.
