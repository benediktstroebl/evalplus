```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after executing a series of deposit and withdrawal operations represented by the input list.

The function utilizes a simple loop to iterate through each operation in the input list. For each operation, it updates the current balance by adding or subtracting the value of the operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it implies that there is a moment when the account balance is negative, and thus, the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero during the sequence of operations. 

This approach ensures that the function promptly responds with `True` if any sequence of operations causes the account balance to become negative, and returns `False` otherwise. 

The unit tests provided earlier demonstrate the function's behavior and correctly highlight that it passes both test cases, showcasing its ability to accurately solve the problem. This function is a good candidate for reuse in various codebase that requires detecting negative account balances during a sequence of financial operations.
