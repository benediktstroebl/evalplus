```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. It does so in the following steps:
1. The function initialize a variable `balance` to zero, this variable will keep track of the current balance of the account throughout the operations.
2. Then, iterates over each element `op` in the input `operations` list, simulating the effects of each operation on the account balance.
3. In each iteration, it adds the value of `op` to the `balance`. This reflects the change in the account balance after each operation.
4. If at any point the `balance` becomes less than zero(falls below zero), it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance crossed below zero.
5. If the loop completes without the account balance falling below zero, it returns `False`, indicating that the account balance remained non-negative throughout all the operations. 

Overall, the `below_zero` function encapsulates the logic to determine whether an account, starting with a balance of zero, can end up with a negative balance after some sequence of deposit and withdrawal operations. 

This script provides a concise and clear way to solve the problem statement provided and should help students effectively tackle similar challenges in their competitive programming journeys.
