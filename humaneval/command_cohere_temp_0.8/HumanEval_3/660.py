```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if at any point the balance of operations falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function increments the `balance` parameter with each operation in the list, and checks if it is less than zero. If it is, the function returns `True`. If the balance is zero at the end of the loop, the function returns `False`.

This solution adheres to the problem statement and passes the tests provided. 
This solution is efficient with a time complexity of `O(n)` where `n` is the number of operations in the input list. It also has a space complexity of `O(1)` as it only stores a single variable, which is the balance, during the execution of the function.
