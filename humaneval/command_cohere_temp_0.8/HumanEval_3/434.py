```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and determines whether the balance of the bank account will fall below zero at any point. The function tracks the balance by initializing it to zero and then incrementing or decrementing it based on the operations encountered in the input list. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This solution follows the test scenario provided in the prompt and should return `True` for examples like `below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])`, but not for cases like `below_zero([1, 2, 3])`.
