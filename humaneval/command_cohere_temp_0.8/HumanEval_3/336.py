```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It accomplishes this by iterating through each operation in the input `operations` list, incrementing the balance by the value of each operation. If the final balance is less than zero, the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns `False`.

This solution follows the spec outlined in the problem statement and should produce the correct output for the test cases provided. Let me know if you would like to further clarify anything or have additional inquiries!
