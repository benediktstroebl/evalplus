```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script introduces an iterative approach to simulate bank operations. It starts by initializing a balance attribute to zero, then iterates through each operation in the input list. During each iteration, the current operation is added to the current balance, reflecting the effect of the operation on the account. After adding the operation, the script checks if the new balance is less than zero. If this condition is met, it immediately returns True, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at some point during the operations. If the loop completes without the balance dropping to zero, it returns False, suggesting that all operations maintained a balance above or equal to zero. This method efficiently solves the problem using a single loop.
