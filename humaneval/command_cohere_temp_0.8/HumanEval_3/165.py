```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function iterates through the list of operations, accumulating the balance while keeping track of the current total. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`. This solution follows the specification of the problem outlined in the prompt. 

Here is some example output testing the function using the example use cases provided in the markdown code block:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

This code successfully addresses the problem outlined in the prompt and provides a standalone solution.
