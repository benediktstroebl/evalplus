```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function iterates through each operation in the list, simulating the effects on the account balance. It keeps track of the balance as it processes each operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at some point. If the entire list of operations is processed without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`.

The function is designed to efficiently handle the problem statement with a straightforward implementation. It provides a clear and concise way to determine whether the account balance will fall below zero at any point based on the given operations. 

This approach ensures that the function directly solves the problem statement without introducing unnecessary complexity or additional parameters.
