```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). It iterates through each operation in the list, updating the balance by adding or subtracting the value of the operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at some point. If no such instance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations. 

This solution is concise and efficiently determines if the account balance goes below zero at any point during the sequence of operations. 

This approach is efficient and has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations in the list. It is also space efficient as it doesn't require additional space for storing intermediate values.
