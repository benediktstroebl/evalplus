```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each operation in the list. It adds each operation to the current balance and checks if the balance falls below 0. If it does, it immediately returns `True`. If no negative balance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of the loop. 

This solution follows the given test examples provided in the prompt and should return `False` for the first case and `True` for the second case. 
The function returns a boolean value `True` if the balance falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations, indicating a negative balance; otherwise, it returns `False` indicating a non-negative balance after all operations. It uses a simple loop and a variable to keep track of the balance, updating this variable with each operation.
