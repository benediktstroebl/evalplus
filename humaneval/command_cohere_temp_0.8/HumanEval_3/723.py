```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after executing a series of deposit and withdrawal operations represented by the input list.

The function utilizes a simple loop to iterate through each operation in the input list. For each operation, it updates the current balance by adding or subtracting the value of the operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it implies that there is a moment when the account balance became negative, and thus, the function returns `True`. If no such moment is encountered, the function returns `False`.

This approach ensures that the function directly processes each operation in the input list, making it efficient and avoiding any unnecessary complexity. It provides a straightforward solution to the problem, accurately detecting whether the account balance falls below zero at any point during the sequence of transactions. 

The unit tests provided are adequate and cover both scenarios of returning `True` and `False` for the given input lists. However, it is recommended to incorporate additional tests covering a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases and scenarios where the balance goes below zero multiple times within the same list to ensure the accuracy of the function in those cases too.  Overall, the provided solution is coherent, efficient, and well-structured, which makes it a robust solution to the problem.
