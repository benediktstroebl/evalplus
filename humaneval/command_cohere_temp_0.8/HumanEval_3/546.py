```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. It does so by iterating through each value in the input list and simulating the effect of each operation on the account balance.

The function starts by initializing a variable called `balance` to 0, which represents the initial balance of the account. It then iterates through each element `op` in the `operations` list. For each operation, the function adds the value of `op` to the `balance`. This simulates the effect of a deposit or withdrawal operation on the account balance. 

After processing all operations, the function returns `True` if the account balance ever fell below zero at any point during the operations, indicating that the account balance became negative at some point. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero. 

This approach effectively solves the problem using a simple loop and a few lines of code, accurately representing the described scenario of simulating account operations and determining whether the balance falls below zero at any point.  It is important to note that this function assumes that the input list `operations` only contains integers representing deposit and withdrawal values. Other data types or values might lead to unexpected results.
