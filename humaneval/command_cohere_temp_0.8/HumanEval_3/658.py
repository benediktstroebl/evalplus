```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the actions of these operations on a bank account balance and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It iterates through each operation in the input list, adding the operation's value to the current balance. If the balance ever becomes negative, it immediately returns `True`. If the end of the list is reached without the balance ever falling below zero, it returns `False`. 

Here is an example usage of the function from the original markdown code block:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This example showcases the function's behavior when given two distinct scenarios. In the first example, the function is invoked with a list of operations `[1, 2, 3]`, which represents a series of deposits that never dip the account balance into negative territory. Consequently, the function returns `False`. In the second example, the function is invoked with a list of operations `[1, 2, -4, 5]`, where two deposits and two withdrawals are performed. At the end of the second withdrawal, the account balance will be -1, hence the function returns `True`.  This function is essential in identifying risky financial trends in bank accounts.
