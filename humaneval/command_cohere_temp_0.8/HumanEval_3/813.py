```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each value in the input list. It simulates a bank account where each item in the list can be either a deposit or withdrawal, increasing or decreasing the balance respectively. It checks whether the balance falls below 0 at any point, indicating a negative balance. If it encounters a negative balance, it returns `True`. If it completes iteration without encountering a negative balance, it returns `False`.

This solution adheres to the problem statement and provides an accurate way to determine if the balance falls below zero at any point. 

This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list.
