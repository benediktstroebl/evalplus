```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `List[int]` and returns a `bool`. It iterates through each operation in the input list and accumulates them into a running balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went negative at some point. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, it returns `False`. 

This solution follows the descriptive context of the problem statement and uses a simple loop and accumulator approach to solve it. 
The function can be tested as follows:
```python
# Test case 1
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: False

# Test case 2
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Output: True
```

The function should return `False` for the first test case and `True` for the second test case as explained in the problem statement.
