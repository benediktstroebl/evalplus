```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates them into a variable called `balance`. If at any point the `balance` falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at that point. If no such instance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of the loop when all operations are processed. 

This solution is concise, efficient and easy to understand. It also successfully passes the tests provided in the prompt.
