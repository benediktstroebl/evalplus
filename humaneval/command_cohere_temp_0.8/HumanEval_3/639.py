```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (representing deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account) and returns `True` if the balance falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise.

The function iterates through each operation in the list and updates the balance accordingly. If the balance ever becomes negative, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the balance fell below zero at least once. If no such instance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations. 

This solution is efficient with a time complexity of `O(n)` since it checks each operation sequentially only once.
