```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, representing deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. It iterates through each operation in the list, accumulating the balance of the account. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance has gone negative at some point. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, it returns `False`. 

This solution is concise and directly iterates through the operations, making it efficient with a time complexity of `O(n)` where `n` is the number of operations.
