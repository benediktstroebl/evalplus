```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations `List[int]` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and calculates the balance by summing up the operations. If the balance falls below zero at any point, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero. If the balance doesn't go below zero after processing all operations, it returns `False`.

This solution follows the prompt's expected behavior as it correctly identifies that the list `[1, 2, -4, 5]` returns `True` because the balance dips below zero with the withdrawal operation `-4`.
