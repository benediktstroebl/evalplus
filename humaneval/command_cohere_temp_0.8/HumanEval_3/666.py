```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (representing deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account) and returns `True` if the balance falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise.

The function iterates through each operation in the input list. For each operation, it updates the balance by the value of the operation. If the balance becomes negative at any point, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, it returns `False`.

This solution is efficient, with a time complexity of `O(n)` where `n` is the number of operations given, since it checks each operation only once and has no redundant iterations.
