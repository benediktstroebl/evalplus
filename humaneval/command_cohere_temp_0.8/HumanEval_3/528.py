```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The function monitors the balance of the account and returns `True` if at any point the account balance falls below zero, indicating a deficit. If the account balance remains non-negative throughout all the operations, it returns `False`. 

Example usage:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

This utility function can be utilized to determine whether an account balance could go negative based on a series of deposit and withdrawal actions.
