```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after executing a series of deposit and withdrawal operations represented by the `operations` list.

It iterates through each value in the `operations` list, adding each operation to the current balance. If the balance becomes negative at any point, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at some point. If no negative balance is reached, it returns `False` at the end of the loop when all operations have been processed.

This solution is efficient, with a time complexity of `O(n)` since it checks each operation in the list once.
