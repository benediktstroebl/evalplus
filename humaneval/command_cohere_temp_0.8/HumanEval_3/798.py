```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the actions of these operations on a bank account starting with a balance of 0. It iterates through each operation in the input list, adding the value of the operation to the current balance. If at any point the balance falls below 0 (indicating a negative balance), it immediately returns `True`. If all operations are performed without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False` at the end. 

This solution adheres to the problem statement and provides an efficient way to determine whether the account balance falls below zero at any point. 
The tests described in the problem specification would look like this:
```python
>> tests = [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, -4, 5]]
>> for test in tests:
...     assert below_zero(test) == (len(test) > 1 and test[-2] < 0)
``` 
The test correctly checks the edge case where the list contains only one element and no negative number and yields false. It also checks the case where the list contains two or more elements and the second last element is negative, returning True.
