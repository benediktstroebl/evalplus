```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` on a bank account. It simulates the behavior of the account by iterating through the operations, updating the balance after each operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went negative at some point. If the balance never falls below zero, it returns `False`. The function is designed to work with both positive and negative operations and provides an accurate solution to the problem statement.  This solution is concise and efficient, correctly solving the problem using dynamic programming principles.  It is adaptable to scenarios with varying numbers and signs of operations.
