```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations`, likely representing deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. The function initializes a variable `balance` to zero, and then iterates through each operation in the input list. It accumulates the effect of each operation on the balance (deposits increase it, withdrawals decrease it) and checks if the balance ever falls below zero. If it does, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the balance went below zero at least once. If no such instance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations, making it efficient for large inputs while accurately solving the problem.
