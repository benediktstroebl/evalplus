```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It simulates the actions on the account by updating the balance accordingly. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it returns `True`, indicating that the account went into a negative balance at some point. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

The function is tested against the given examples in the prompt, ensuring it returns `False` for a positive balance sequence and `True` for a sequence that causes a negative balance.  This self-contained script provides a clear and concise solution to the problem, making it easy for others to use and understand the functionality.
