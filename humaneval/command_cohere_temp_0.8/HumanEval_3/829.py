```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the progression of the account's balance after each operation and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. 

The function uses a loop to iterate through each operation in the input list. It updates the current balance by adding the value of each operation (either a deposit or withdrawal). If the balance becomes negative at any point, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`. 

Here's an example usage illustration:
```python
# Example 1
input_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(below_zero(input_list))  # Output: False

# Example 2
input_list = [1, 2, -4, 5]
print(below_zero(input_list))  # Output: True
``` 

The function's behavior aligns with the given test cases, providing a correct solution to the problem. 

This approach has a time complexity of `O(n)` since it iterates through each operation once, making it efficient for moderate-sized operation lists.
