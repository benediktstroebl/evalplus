```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates them into a variable called `balance`. If at any point the `balance` falls below zero, it indicates that the account's balance went into a negative state, and the function returns `True`. If the account's balance remains non-negative throughout all operations, it returns `False`. 

This solution adheres to the problem statement and provides an accurate way to determine if the account balance goes negative at any point due to the given operations. 

This approach is efficient because it has a time complexity of O(n), where 'n' is the number of elements in the input list 'operations'. This corresponds to the number of operations done on the account.
