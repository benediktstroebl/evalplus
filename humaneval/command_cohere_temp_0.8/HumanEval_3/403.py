```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `List[int]` and calculates the ending balance after each operation. If the balance goes negative at any point, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The script passes the given tests of returning `False` for the first test and `True` for the second test. 
The function returns `True` for the second test case `[1, 2, -4, 5]` because the balance of the account becomes negative after the third operation, so the function returns `True`.

This script includes type annotations, which are a great practice for larger codebases to improve readability and maintainability. You can find these reable ticks in the script:
```
- The function takes in a list of `List[int]` and returns a boolean with `bool`.
- The variable `balance` is of type `int`.
- The loop iterates over the elements of the input list using `for op in operations:`.
``` 
These ticks allow other developers to understand the types of variables, making the code more understandable and maintainable.
