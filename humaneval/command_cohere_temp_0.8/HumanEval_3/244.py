```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. The function iterates through each value in the input list and accumulates the balance of the bank account. If at any point the balance falls below zero, the function returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end. 

This solution is efficient and linear in its time complexity since it iterates through each element only once, making it an O(n) algorithm. 

This solution uses the `List[int]` datatype from the `typing` module. The `List` denotes that the function `below_zero` accepts a list of integers and `int` denotes that it returns a boolean value.
