```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of a bank account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after executing all the given deposit and withdrawal operations.

The function iterates through each value in the input list, which represent deposit and withdrawal operations, and simulates the effect of each operation on the account balance. It keeps a running total of the balance in the `balance` variable.

If at any point the calculated `balance` becomes less than zero, it means the account balance fell below zero at some point during the operations, and the function immediately returns `True`. If none of the operations cause the balance to dip below zero, the function returns `False` after processing all the operations.

This solution adheres to the requirement that the function should return `True` if the account balance ever falls below zero, even if it returns `False` when the balance never falls below zero. 

This approach is efficient because it only requires a single pass through the operations list and directly simulates the effect of each operation on the account balance.
