```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of operations, predicted as `List[int]`. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates them into a variable called balance. After each addition, it checks if the balance is less than zero, returning `True` immediately if it is. If no negative balance is reached, it returns `False` at the end of the loop. 

Here is an example usage of this code:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

This example corresponds to the provided test cases. In the first case, the list of operations contains [1, 2, 3], so the balance is only increased and never falls below zero, thus `below_zero` returns `False`. In the second case, the list of operations contains [1, 2, -4, 5], so the balance is first increased to 3, then decreased to -1, and then increased to 4, so it falls below zero at one point, and `below_zero` returns `True`.  This script ensures that the function `below_zero` will output the correct boolean value for any list of operations provided.
