```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). The function simulates the actions of these operations on a bank account starting with a zero balance, and returns `True` if at any point the account balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It does this by iterating through each operation in the input list and updating the account balance accordingly. 

Here's an example of how to use the function:
```python
# Test the function with a list of operations
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Output: True
``` 

This would output:
```
False
True
``` 

This indicates that the account balance won't fall below zero with the first operation, but it will with the second example. 

Note that the function assumes that the input list contains only positive or negative integers, which represents deposit or withdrawal operations on the bank account.
