```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if at any point the balance of operations falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function increments the `balance` variable with each operation in the list, and triggers a return of `True` whenever `balance` crosses the zero mark to negative territory. The function returns `False` at the end if the full list of operations didn't push the balance into negative values. 

This solution works without any imports and with only a single `List[int]` parameter, aligning perfectly with the prompt's specifications.
