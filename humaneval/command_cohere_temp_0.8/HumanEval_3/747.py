```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations `List[int]` as an input. It iterates through each operation in the list and calculates the current balance by adding the operation value to the previous balance. If the calculated balance is less than zero at any point, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once. If no such instance is found after processing all operations, it returns `False`. 

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem statement. It also follows Python's idiomatic style and uses typing for better code organization. 

This code can be tested with the following calls:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

These tests check if the function works correctly for the given inputs.
