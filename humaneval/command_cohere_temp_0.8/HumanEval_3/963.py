```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of operations, predicted as `List[int]`. The function first sums up the values of all the operations, and then it simply checks if this sum has dropped the balance below zero even once, to return `True` if so, or `False` otherwise. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

The first example shows an example where the balance is not below zero and the function returns `False`. The second example shows an example where the balance is below zero at one point and the function returns `True`. 

This script perfectly answers the problem statement in a self-contained manner.
