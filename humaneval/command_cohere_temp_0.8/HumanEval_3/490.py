```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each operation in the input list.

For each operation, it adds it to the current balance (thus simulating the effect of the operation on the account balance). Then it checks if the balance becomes negative at any point. If it does, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once. If the loop completes without the balance ever falling below zero, it returns `False`, indicating that the account never fell into a negative balance. 

The function is designed to efficiently handle the scenario and provide the requisite outcome without requiring any additional variables or complex computations.
