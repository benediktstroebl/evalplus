```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each operation in the input list.

For each operation, it adds it to the current balance. If at any point the calculated balance falls below 0 (indicating a negative balance), it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once. If no such instance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of the loop when all operations have been processed. 

The function returns a boolean value `True` if the balance goes negative at any point in the sequence of operations, and `False` otherwise. 

This approach has a time complexity of `O(n)` since it iterates through each element in the list once, resulting in a linear increase of operations.
