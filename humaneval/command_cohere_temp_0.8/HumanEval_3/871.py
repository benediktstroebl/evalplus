```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It iterates through each operation in the list, updating the balance by adding or subtracting the value of the operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If no such instance is found, it returns `False`. 

This solution is concise and efficiently determines if the account balance goes below zero at any point during the given operations. 

This code can be tested against the provided examples in the prompt, which will return `False` for `[1, 2, 3]` and `True` for `[1, 2, -4, 5]`.  This will ensure its behavior matches the expected functionality.
