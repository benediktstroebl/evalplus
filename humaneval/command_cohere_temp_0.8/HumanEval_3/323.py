```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an operation on the account, such as a deposit or withdrawal. The task is to determine whether the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

The function starts by initializing the balance of the account to zero. Then, it iterates through each element in the `operations` list. For each operation, it updates the balance by adding or subtracting the value of the operation. If the balance becomes negative at any point (`balance < 0`), it indicates that the account balance fell below zero, and the function immediately returns `True`. If the account balance remains non-negative throughout all the operations, the function returns `False` once it has processed all the operations. 

This solution efficiently determines whether the account balance falls below zero during any part of the given operations, without explicitly tracking all intermediate balances.

The unit tests for this problem will typically involve calling the `below_zero` function with example `operations` lists and verifying that it returns the correct results. For example, when the list of operations includes a negative value, the function should return `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at some point. If the list of operations does not contain a negative value, the function should return `False`. 

These tests should be included in the script to validate the correctness of the solution, ensuring that it handles different scenarios of deposits and withdrawals correctly. 
```python
# Test scenario where there is a negative operation
test_list = [1, 2, -4, 5]
test_result = below_zero(test_list)
assert test_result == True

# Test scenario where all operations are non-negative
test_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
test_result = below_zero(test_list)
assert test_result == False
``` 
These tests cover both scenarios described in the problem statement, ensuring that the function `below_zero` correctly identifies situations where the account balance falls below zero and returns `True`, and also correctly identifies situations where the account balance remains non-negative and returns `False`.
