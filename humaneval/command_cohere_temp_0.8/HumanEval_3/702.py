```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and determines whether the balance of the account will fall below zero at any point. The function tracks the balance by initializing it to zero and then updating it by adding each operation to it. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Here is an example usage of the function showing a list of operations on a bank account starting with zero balance. The example shows that the balance falls below zero with the provided operations (`[1, 2, -4, 5]`) and thus the function returns `True`:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 

And here is an example usage of the function showing a list of operations on a bank account starting with zero balance. The example shows that the balance does not fall below zero with the provided operations (`[1, 2, 3]`) and thus the function returns `False`:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
``` 

This script provides a self-contained function that solves the problem using a straightforward approach and passes the given tests.
