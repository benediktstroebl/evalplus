```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It simulates the actions on the account by updating the balance after each operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went negative at some point. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end. 

Here is an example usage of the script:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
This example mirrors the test cases provided in the original problem statement.
