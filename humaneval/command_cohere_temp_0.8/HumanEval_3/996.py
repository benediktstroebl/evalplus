```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of a bank account, which starts at zero balance, can fall below zero after executing all the given deposit and withdrawal operations.

The function iterates through each value in the input list, which represent deposit and withdrawal operations, and simulates the effect of each operation on the account balance. It keeps a running total of the balance in the `balance` variable.

If at any point the calculated `balance` becomes less than zero, it means the account balance fell below zero at some point, and the function returns `True`. If the account balance never falls below zero after processing all the operations, the function returns `False`. 

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem, and the provided explanation clarifies the logic and intent of the code.  This way, the function fulfills the requirements of the problem statement.
