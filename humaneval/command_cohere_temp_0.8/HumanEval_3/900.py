```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The task is to determine whether the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

The function sets the initial balance to zero and then iterates through each element in the `operations` list. It updates the balance by adding the value of each operation (deposit or withdrawal) to the current balance. After each operation, it checks if the balance has fallen below zero. If it does, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at that specific point in the operations. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, the function returns `False`.

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem, as it only relies on the list of operations and the built-in Python datatypes, making it self-contained. Also, the function is robust, as it will correctly handle any negative balances after an unlimited number of operations, whether they are deposits or withdrawals.

This solution can be tested with the provided example tests cases in the markdown code block, and it should correctly return `False` for the first case and `True` for the second case.
