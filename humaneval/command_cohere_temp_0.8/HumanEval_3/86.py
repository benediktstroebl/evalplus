```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point after applying the operations, and `False` otherwise.

The function uses a loop to iterate through each operation in the list and simulate the effect of each operation on the account balance. It keeps track of the balance as it applies each operation, and if at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, it returns `False`.

Here is an example usage of this function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
>>> below_zero([-10, -5, -15, -20, -25])
True
``` 

This demonstrates that the function correctly identifies situations where the account balance falls below zero.
