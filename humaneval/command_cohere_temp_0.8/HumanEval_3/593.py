```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). The function iterates through each operation in the list, updating the running balance by adding the value of the operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at some point. If no such instance is found, it returns `False`.

The function is designed to efficiently handle the scenario without explicit looping and conditioning on the sign of the balance, making the code more concise and readable.
