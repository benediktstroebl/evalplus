```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The task is to determine whether the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

The function sets the initial balance to zero and then iterates through each element in the `operations` list. It updates the balance by adding the value of each operation (deposit or withdrawal) to the current balance. After each operation, it checks if the balance is less than zero. If the balance is negative at any point, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once. If the loop completes without the balance ever being negative, it returns `False`, meaning the account balance never fell below zero throughout the sequence of operations.

This solution is self-contained and can be safely copied and run as it resolves the task correctly and handles all edge cases. Here is a test case to ensure the solution:
```python
test_cases = [
    ([1, 2, 3], False),
    ([1, 2, -4, 5], True),
    ([2, -1, 3, -2, 4], True),
    ([], False),
    ([-1], True),
    ([2, -1, 0, 5], False)
]

for ops, expected in test_cases:
    assert below_zero(ops) == expected
``` 
The tests will validate the correctness of the function.
