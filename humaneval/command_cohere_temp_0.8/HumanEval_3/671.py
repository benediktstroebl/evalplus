```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. The function monitors the balance of operations and returns `True` if the balance falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. It does so by iterating through each operation in the input list and updating the running balance accordingly.

Here's an example of how you can use the `below_zero` function with different input operations lists:
```python
# Example 1
input_list = [1, 2, 3]
result = below_zero(input_list)
print(result)  # Output: False

# Example 2
input_list = [1, 2, -4, 5]
result = below_zero(input_list)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

In the first example, the account balance never falls below zero, hence `below_zero` returns `False`. In the second example, the account balance falls below zero with a negative $4 withdrawal operation, so `below_zero` returns `True`.
