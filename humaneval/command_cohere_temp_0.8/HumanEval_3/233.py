```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations, iterates through them, accumulates a balance, and checks if it's negative at any point. The function returns True if the balance falls below zero at any time, and False otherwise. The tests provided in the problem statement are included in the script, verifying the function's behavior against sample inputs.  This solution utilizes a simple loop instead of recursive approach to save the call stack space, especially for large input. 

Here's an example of using the function with a sample input:
```python
 >>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
 True
``` 
This would return `True` because the balance will be negative after the third operation.
