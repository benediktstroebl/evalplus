```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). The function simulates the actions of these operations on a bank account starting with a balance of 0, and checks if the balance ever falls below 0 at any point. If it does, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`. 

The function uses a loop to iterate through each operation in the input list. For each operation, it updates the balance by adding (for deposits) or subtracting (withdrawals) the value of the operation. If at any point the balance becomes less than 0, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account's balance fell below zero at some point during the operations. If the loop completes without the balance ever falling below zero, it returns `False`, indicating that the account's balance never fell below zero. 

This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list `operations`, as it checks each operation sequentially. It is a simple and efficient solution for this problem that clearly illustrates the intent of the given code snippet.
