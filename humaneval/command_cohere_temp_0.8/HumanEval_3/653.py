```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The function's purpose is to determine whether the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

The function starts by initializing the balance of the account to zero. It then iterates through each element in the `operations` list. For each operation, it adds the operation's value to the current balance. If the balance becomes negative at any point (meaning there is a net withdrawal amount greater than the initial balance), the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account's balance fell below zero at least once. If the loop completes without the balance ever going negative, the function returns `False`, meaning the account's balance never fell below zero throughout the sequence of operations. 

This approach uses a simple iterative algorithm and maintains a running balance, making it efficient to solve the problem and pass the given tests.
