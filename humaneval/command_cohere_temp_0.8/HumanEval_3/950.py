```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code tracks the balance as it processes each operation in the input list. If at any point the balance drops below zero, it immediately returns True, indicating that the balance fell below zero at least once. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, it returns False. 

Here is an example of how you can test this function:
```python
tested = below_zero([1, 2, 3])
assert tested is False

tested = below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
assert tested is True
```

These tests will confirm that the function behaves as expected based on the problem statement.  The first test asserts that the function returns False when the operations result in a valid balance after execution, while the second test asserts that the function returns True when the list of operations results in a balance below zero.  This completely fits the requirements of the problem.
