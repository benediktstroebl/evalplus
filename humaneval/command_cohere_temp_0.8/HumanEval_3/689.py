```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after executing a series of deposit and withdrawal operations represented by the `operations` list.

The function begins by initializing a variable called `balance` to 0, which represents the initial balance of the account. It then iterates through each element in the `operations` list, adding each operation to the balance. If the balance becomes negative at any point, meaning there is a net withdrawal exceeding the amount deposited, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the balance fell below zero at least once. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the balance never fell below zero during the given operations. 

This solution is efficient because it uses a for loop, which is simpler and more readable than using a while loop or recursion, and it doesn't make any unnecessary calculations.
