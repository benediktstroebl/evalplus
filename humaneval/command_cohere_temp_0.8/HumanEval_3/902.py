```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and then iterates through each value in the input list. It accumulates the balance as it goes through the operations. If at any point the balance falls below 0, it immediately returns `True`. If the entire list is processed and the balance never fell below 0, it returns `False` since the final balance is still 0. 

This TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach implementation passes the given tests and can be integrated into any codebase to solve the "below zero" problem.
