```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each value in the input list. It assumes that each integer represents a deposit or withdrawal operation, where positive values represent deposits, and negative values represent withdrawals.

For each operation, it updates the balance by adding the operation value. Then it checks if the balance falls below zero. If the balance is negative at any point, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once. If the loop completes without the balance ever falling below zero, it returns `False`.

This solution is concise and directly tackles the problem statement, making it clear and readable.
