```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations`, presumably representing deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. The function iterates through each operation in the list, accumulating them to calculate the current balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, it returns `False`. 

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem statement. It also meets the criteria of being self-contained, as it doesn't rely on external variables or functions that aren't explicitly defined within the code block.
