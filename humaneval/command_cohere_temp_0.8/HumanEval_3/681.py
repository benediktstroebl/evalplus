```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function iterates through the list of `operations`, accumulating a balance by adding each operation. If the balance falls below zero at any point, it immediately returns `True`. If the end of the operations list is reached without falling below zero, it returns `False`. This approach ensures efficiency and accuracy in detecting when the account balance falls below zero.  This solution is concise and directly addresses the requirements of the problem.
