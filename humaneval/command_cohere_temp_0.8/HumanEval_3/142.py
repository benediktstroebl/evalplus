```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). The function simulates the effect of these operations on a balance and checks if it falls below zero at any point. If the balance ever goes negative, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`. This function is straightforward and self-contained, easy to understand, and should work correctly for any input list of operations.  It is also efficient, as it has a time complexity of `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input list.  This matches the specification in the Markdown code block.  This code block should help you design test cases and test the function's behavior against your expectations.  If you need help designing tests, please let me know.  Also, best practices encourage adding more comprehensive tests covering different scenarios like edge cases and large lists of operations.  These might be useful to ensure the stability and reliability of the function.  If you would like me to add these additional tests, let me know the specifics, and I'd be glad to incorporate them into our code.
