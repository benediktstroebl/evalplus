```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates them into a running balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If the end of the list is reached without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`.

This solution follows the descriptive context of the prompt regarding the purpose of the function and the expected behavior of the tests, where it is explicitly mentioned that the function should return `True` if at any point the balance goes below zero and `False` otherwise. 

This aligns with the first test case provided in the prompt (`[1, 2, 3]`), where the balance never falls below zero, leading to a `False` result. Meanwhile, for the second test case (`[1, 2, -4, 5]`), the balance dips below zero with the withdrawal of 4, resulting in a `True` value.
