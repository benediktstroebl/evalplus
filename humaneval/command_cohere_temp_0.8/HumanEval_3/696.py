```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, such as deposits and withdrawals, and determine whether the account balance falls below zero at any point.

Here's how it works:
1. The function starts with a `balance` variable set to 0, representing the initial balance of the account.
2. It then iterates through each element (`op`) in the input list of operations.
3. For each operation, the function adds the value of `op` to the `balance`. This simulates either a deposit (positive value) or withdrawal (negative value) to the account.
4. If at any point the `balance` becomes less than 0 (indicating a negative balance), the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero.
5. If the loop completes without encountering a negative balance, the function returns `False`, meaning the account balance never fell below zero throughout the given operations.

This function utilizes a simple iterative approach to monitor the account balance as each operation is performed. Its rationale is to promptly detect any negative balance occurrences and return the corresponding result. 

Additionally, the function features an example usage demonstration that validates its functionality:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

The first test case, `[1, 2, 3]`, demonstrates a list of operations with a positive sum, and the function returns `False` since the account balance never falls below zero. In the second test case, `[1, 2, -4, 5]`, the account balance becomes negative after the third operation, leading the function to return `True`.

The provided code appears to be a straightforward and effective solution to the problem as stated.
