```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code tracks the balance as it processes each operation in the input list. If at any point the balance dips negative, it returns True, indicating the account balance fell below zero at least once. If not, it returns False.

Here's an example of function usage and tests to verify its correctness:
```python
tested = below_zero([1, 2, 3])
assert not tested

tested = below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
assert tested
```

In the first test, the balance never falls below zero, hence `below_zero` returns `False`.

In the second test, the balance falls below zero after the second operation, so `below_zero` returns `True`. 
This code will accurately determine if the balance of the bank account falls below zero at any point.
