```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of operations, assumed to be either deposit or withdrawal amounts, on a bank account. The function initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each operation in the input list. It accumulates the balance as if these operations were carried out in real-time, incrementing or decrementing the balance depending on whether the operation is a deposit or withdrawal. 

For each operation, it checks if the balance becomes negative and returns `True` immediately if this is the case. If no negative balance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of the loop, indicating that the account never fell below zero during the given operations. 

This solution is efficient because it uses only a single pass through the operation list and has a time complexity of O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the input list.
