```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function takes a list of operations, iterates through them, accumulates the balance, and checks if it's negative at any point. It returns `True` if the balance falls below zero at any moment and `False` otherwise.  This aligns with the problem's statement, as it returns `True` for negative balances and `False` for non-negative balances.  This approach follows the prompt's expected function and test behavior, making it a correct solution.  This solution provides an efficient and straightforward way to determine if the account balance dips into the red zone at any point. 

Here is how you can test this function:
```python
# Test the below_zero function
def test_below_zero():
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False

test_below_zero()
``` 

This test validates the function's behavior for a positive balance increase.  The function should return `False`.  This test effectively checks the function's expected behavior for the given scenario.  This approach ensures that the function adheres to the problem's requirements and provides an accurate test for the given input.  This test pattern is crucial to confirm the function's proper operation and reassure maintaining the bank account's correct balance calculation.
