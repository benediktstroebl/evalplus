```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, representing deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. It iterates through each operation in the list, updating the balance by adding or subtracting the operation amount. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at some point. If no such instance is found, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations. 

This solution is concise and efficiently determines if the account balance goes below zero at any point during the given operations. 
Let's break down the solution step by step:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem statement clearly explains the requirement: to determine if the balance of a bank account, which starts at zero, falls below zero at any point when applying a list of deposit and withdrawal operations.
2. **Defining the Function**: We start by defining a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of operations as its input parameter. This function will ultimately return a boolean value (`True` or `False`) depending on whether the account balance falls below zero at any point.
3. **Initializing the Balance**: To keep track of the account balance, we initialize a variable called `balance` to 0. This represents the current state of the account before any operations are applied.
4. **Iterating Over the Operations**: We then use a `for` loop to iterate over each element in the input list of `operations`. Each element represents a single deposit or withdrawal operation on the account.
5. **Updating the Balance**: Inside the loop, we add each operation to the `balance` variable. If it's a deposit operation, we add its amount to the balance; if it's a withdrawal operation, we subtract its amount from the balance. This effectively simulates the effect of each operation on the account balance.
6. **Checking for Negative Balance**: As we iterate through the operations, we check if the `balance` variable becomes less than 0 at any point. If it does, it means the account balance has fallen below zero, and we return `True` immediately.
7. **Completion Check**: If we finish iterating through all the operations and the balance has never gone below zero, we return `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero during any point in the given operations.

This function is a self-contained solution to the problem, and you can use it as mentioned in the original markdown code block to test it with different input operation lists.
