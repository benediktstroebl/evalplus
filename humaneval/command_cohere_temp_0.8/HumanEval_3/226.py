```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The function's purpose is to determine whether the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

The function starts by initializing the balance of the account to zero. It then iterates through each element in the `operations` list. For each operation, it adds the operation's value to the current balance. If the balance becomes negative at any point (meaning there is a net withdrawal amount greater than the initial balance), the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the balance fell below zero at least once. If the loop completes without the balance ever falling below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the balance never fell below zero throughout the sequence of operations. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
 >>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

In the first example, the function `below_zero` is called with the operations list `[1, 2, 3]`. This represents a scenario where there are three operations (deposits) of $1, $2, and $3. Since the balance never falls below zero, the function returns `False`.

In the second example, the function is called with the operations list `[1, 2, -4, 5]`. This represents a scenario where there are four operations: a deposit of $1, a deposit of $2, a withdrawal of $4, and a deposit of $5. The net result of the third operation is that the balance falls below zero. Therefore, the function returns `True`. 

The script provides a concise and straightforward way to determine whether a bank account's balance will fall below zero across a series of operations.  It is a useful tool for handling such financial-related computational tasks.
