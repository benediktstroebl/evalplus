```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates them into a running balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If the end of the list is reached without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`. 

This solution follows the prompt's expected functionality, where it returns `True` for lists like `[1, 2, -4, 5]` and `False` for lists like `[1, 2, 3]`.
