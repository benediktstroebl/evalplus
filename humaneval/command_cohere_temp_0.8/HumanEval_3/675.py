```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It iterates through each operation in the list, updating the running balance by adding the value of the operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If all operations are successful, it returns `False` at the end. 

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem statement. It also follows Python's coding style and PEP 8 guidelines.
