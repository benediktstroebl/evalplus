```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (representing deposits and withdrawals from an account) and returns a boolean indicating whether the account balance falls below zero at any point.

The function iterates through each operation in the list and updates the account balance accordingly. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`.

This solution is efficient, with a time complexity of `O(n)` where `n` is the number of operations, as it requires iterating through the list of operations just once.
