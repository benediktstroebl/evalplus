```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The task is to determine whether the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

The function sets the initial balance to 0 and then iterates through each element in the `operations` list. It updates the balance by adding the value of each operation (deposit or withdrawal) to the current balance. After each operation, it checks if the balance is less than 0. If it is, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once during the sequence of operations. If the loop completes without the balance ever falling below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero.

This approach is efficient because it uses a single loop to iterate through the operations and updates the balance incrementally. It also takes advantage of Python's typing module to define the types of the input parameters for improved code readability and maintainability.
