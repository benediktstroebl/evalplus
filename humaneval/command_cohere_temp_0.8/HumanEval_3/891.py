```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and checks whether any point the balance of operations will be below zero. This is done by simply summing up the operations in the list and checking if the sum is less than zero at any point. The function returns `True` if the balance goes below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

This would return `False` for the first example because the balance is never zero and always increases. Whereas the second example returns `True` because the balance becomes negative after the -$4 operation, even though it goes back to positive later.  Overall, the function solves the prompt's problem and would pass the tests.
