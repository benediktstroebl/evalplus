```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. The function increments the `balance` parameter with the corresponding `deposit` or `withdrawal` operation. The function returns `True` if the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It is worth noting that this approach runs in `O(n)` time complexity where `n` is the number of operations in the list.
