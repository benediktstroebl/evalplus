```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). The function simulates the progression of the bank account's balance after each operation, and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It uses a `typing` list to allow for type-checking of the input parameter. 

To test this function, you can use the following commands:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

The first test case passes since the account balance never falls below zero, while the second test case fails since the account balance falls below zero with the sequence of operations.  This problem can also be efficiently solved using `itertools.accumulate` + `max` but the solution provided is simpler.
