```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `List[int]` and calculates the ending balance after each operation. If the ending balance is less than 0, the function returns `True`. If the ending balance is 0 or positive, the function returns `False`. 

Here is an example usage of the script:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
This example usage shows that below_zero returns `True` for operations that result in a negative balance and `False` otherwise. 

If you wish to check the correctness of the script, you can add the provided test cases to a separate cell within the Markdown code block and run them using the normal Jupyter notebook cell execution commands ('Shift + Enter' for a single cell or 'Shift + Alt + I' to execute the entire block).
