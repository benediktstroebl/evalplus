```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script introduces an iterative approach to simulating the bank account operations. It iterates over each operation, accumulates the balance accordingly, and checks if it falls below zero at any point. This method is efficient and avoids the use of recursion or accumulation of multiple values.
