```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers `operations` as input. It simulates the operations done on a bank account, starting with a zero balance. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates the balance of the account. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account's balance went below zero at least once. If no such instance is found, it returns `False` after processing all operations.

This solution follows the problem statement and provides an accurate way to determine if the account balance falls below zero at any point.
