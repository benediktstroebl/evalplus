```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and determines whether the balance of a bank account, initialized at zero, would fall below zero at any point when applying the given operations. The function iterates through each operation in the input list, adding it to the running balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If no such point is reached, it returns `False` at the end of the loop when all operations have been processed. This markdown code block is intended to provide a standalone Python solution to the problem statement, making it easy to understand and usable directly in other contexts, such as a Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
