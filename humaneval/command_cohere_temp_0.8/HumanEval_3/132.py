```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It iterates through each operation in the input list, accumulating a balance as if it were a bank account. When an operation would bring the balance negative, the function returns `True`. If no such operation is encountered, it returns `False`. This solves the problem statement in the markdown code block provided. 

Here's an example of how to use the `below_zero` function with a sample input:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
>>> below_zero([6, -2, 0, -1, 3])
False
``` 
This passes the example tests provided in the problem statement.
