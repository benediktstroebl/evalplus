```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function iterates through the list of `operations` and accumulates the balance of the bank account with each operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`. This algorithm has a time complexity of `O(n)` since it checks each operation in the list once.  This solution is concise and straightforward, providing the desired outcome as described in the prompt. 

Here is a simple test case to validate the functionality of the function:
```python
unittest.TestCase().assertEqual(below_zero([1, 2, 3]), False)
unittest.TestCase().assertEqual(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]), True)
```

This will return `True` for the second test case as the list `[1, 2, -4, 5]` represents a valid scenario where the balance falls below zero with the negative withdrawal operation of `-4`.  This is indicated by the function returning `True` and the test case succeeding.
