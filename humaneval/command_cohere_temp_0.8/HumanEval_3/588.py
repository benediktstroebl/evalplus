```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (of type `List[int]`), which represent the sequence of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. The function initializes the balance to 0 and then iterates through each operation in the list.

For each operation, it adds it to the current balance (e.g., if it's a deposit) or subtracts it from the balance (e.g., if it's a withdrawal). If at any point the balance falls below zero (i.e., negative), it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at some point during the operations.

If the loop completes without the balance ever going negative, it returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero. This function elegantly solves the problem using a single loop, without any explicit need for recursion or memoization.
