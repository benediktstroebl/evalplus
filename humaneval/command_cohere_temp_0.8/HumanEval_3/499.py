```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (of type `List[int]`), and returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point in the operations, and `False` otherwise.

It achieves this by summing up the values of `operations` one by one and initially setting the `balance` to 0. If at any point the `balance` becomes less than 0, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end. 

This solution is efficient and has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations given.
