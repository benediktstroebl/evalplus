```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation represents a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money) and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. 

The function iterates through each operation in the list, adding the operation amount to the running balance. If at any point the balance becomes less than zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once during the sequence of operations. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, it returns `False`. 

This solution is efficient, easy to understand, and correctly solves the problem statement.
