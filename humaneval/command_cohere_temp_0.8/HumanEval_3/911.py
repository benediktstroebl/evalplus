```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an operation on the account, such as a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount.

The function starts with the initial balance of the account set to zero. It then iterates through each element `op` in the `operations` list. For each operation, it updates the balance by adding the effect of the operation (positive for deposits, negative for withdrawals).

During this process, if the balance ever falls below zero (indicating a loss of money), the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once during the sequence of operations. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero throughout the entire sequence of operations.

The function is also designed to work correctly with any number of operations, and it will return the correct result regardless of the order of the operations in the input list. This makes it a flexible solution for the problem as described.
