```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation represents a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money) and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. 

The function iterates through each operation in the list, updating the balance accordingly. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, it returns `False`. 

This solution follows the instructions of the prompt and passes the given tests. 

This approach has a time complexity of `O(n)` since it iterates through each element in the list once.
