```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, representing deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. It keeps a running balance and checks if it goes negative at any point in the operations list. If the balance falls below zero at any moment, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This solution adheres to the problem statement and provides an efficient way to determine if the account balance goes negative at any point.
