```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and then iterates through each value in the input list. It assumes that each integer represents an operation on a bank account where a positive integer represents a deposit, and a negative integer represents a withdrawal (which isn't explicitly mentioned in the prompt).

After each operation, it checks if the balance has fallen below 0. If this happens, the function returns `True`. If no such instance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of the loop. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

This output is consistent with the test cases mentioned in the original problem.
