```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at zero balance and undergoes a series of deposit and withdrawal operations represented by the input list, falls below zero at any point.

The function utilizes a simple loop to iterate through each operation in the input list. For each operation, it updates the current balance by adding or subtracting the value of the operation. If at any point the balance becomes less than zero, it implies the account balance fell below zero at least once, and the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero during the sequence of operations.

This approach ensures that the function directly returns its boolean answer without relying on any explicit exception handling or return statements.
