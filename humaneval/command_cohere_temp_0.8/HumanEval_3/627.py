```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of operations as input, where each operation is represented as an integer (positive for deposits, and negative for withdrawals). The function initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each operation in the input list.

For each operation, it adds it to the current balance. If at any point the balance falls below 0 (indicating a negative balance), the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the balance went below zero at least once. If no such instance is encountered, it continues iterating through all operations, and finally returns `False`, indicating that the balance never fell below zero.

The behavior of the function is demonstrated through doctests embedded in the function specification, as per the problem statement. These tests are inherently part of the function and will be automatically evaluated whenever the function is modified or called.
