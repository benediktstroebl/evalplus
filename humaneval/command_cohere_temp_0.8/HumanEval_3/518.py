```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation representing a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money) on a bank account. The function iterates through each operation, updating the balance and checking if it falls below zero at any point. If the balance ever goes negative, the function returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Here is an example usage of the function which demonstrates its behavior: 
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

This example corresponds to the test cases provided in the problem statement.
