```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It calculates the balance by summing the operations, then checks if it goes negative at any point, in which case it returns `True`, or if it remains non-negative, in which case it returns `False`. The function is tested in the provided markdown code block, demonstrating its behavior for different input operations. 
```python
assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
``` 
This confirms that the function correctly solves the problem of detecting whether the account balance falls below zero at any point given a sequence of deposit and withdrawal operations. 
Here's a brief explanation of the code:
1. The `below_zero` function: This function takes a list of operations (`List[int]`) as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal).

2. Initializing Balance: It initializes a variable `balance` to 0, representing the initial balance of the account.

3. Iterating the Operations: It then iterates through each operation (`op`) in the input list of operations:
   - It adds the `op` to the current balance to simulate the effect of the operation on the account.
   - If the balance becomes negative (i.e., `balance < 0`), it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once.

4. Returning False: If the loop completes without the balance ever becoming negative, it means the account never fell into a negative balance, and the function returns `False`. 

This function efficiently solves the problem using a simple iteration method.  Any list of operations can be passed in to the function to test for the account falling below zero.  The function can be placed into a class or module for further use or extended to handle more complex scenarios if needed.
