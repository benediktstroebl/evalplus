```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The function monitors the balance of the account and returns `True` if at any point the account balance falls below zero, indicating a negative balance. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The function starts by initializing the account balance to zero. It then iterates through each element in the `operations` list. For each operation, it adds the operation's value to the current balance. If the balance becomes negative at any point, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at some point during the operations. If the balance never becomes negative, it returns `False` at the end of the loop, meaning the account never fell into a negative balance. 

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```python
# Test the function
assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
``` 

This tests the function with both valid and invalid input, testing the function against the specified behaviour in the markdown cell.
