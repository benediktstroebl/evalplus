```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after a series of deposit and withdrawal operations given by the input list. 

The function iterates through each value in the input list called `operations`, these values represent consecutive banking operations. It accumulates the balance of the account as it iterates through these operations. Then, the function checks if the total balance has fallen below zero at any point. If this is the case, it returns `True`, if not it returns `False`.

This approach is highly efficient in terms of time and space complexity, as it uses only a constant amount of memory to process the list and performs a linear pass through the operations, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list. 

Below are some test cases that demonstrate the functionality of the function:
```python
# Basic Test Cases
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False

>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True

# Edge Cases
>>> below_zero([0, 0, 0])
False

>>> below_zero([-5, -10, -5])
True

>>> below_zero([-10, 0, -5])
True

>>> below_zero([-1, 1, 0, -2, 1])
True
```
