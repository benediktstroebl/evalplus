```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It computes the resulting balance after each operation and checks if it falls below zero at any point. If the balance ever goes negative, it immediately returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop when all operations are processed. 

This approach has a time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of operations, as it iterates through the operations list once, performing a constant time operation for each element. 

The unit tests that can be used to validate the function are:
```python
def test_below_zero():
    # Below zero at first operation
    assert below_zero([-2, -3]) == True

    # Below zero in the middle
    assert below_zero([4, 5, -10, 6]) == True

    # Below zero multiple times
    assert below_zero([3, -2, -5, 4, -1, 5]) == True

    # Not below zero
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
    assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5, 6]) == False

``` 
This test suite covers different scenarios, including situations where the account balance falls below zero immediately, in the middle, or multiple times throughout the sequence of operations, as well as cases where the balance remains non-negative throughout.
