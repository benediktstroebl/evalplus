```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It iterates through each operation in the list, updating the account balance accordingly. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went negative at some point. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, it returns `False`. 

This code can effectively detect if the account balance goes negative at any point due to the given operations, and provides a clear concise solution to the problem.
