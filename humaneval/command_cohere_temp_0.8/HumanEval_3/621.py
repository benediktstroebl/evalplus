```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, representing deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. It maintains a running balance and checks whether the balance falls below zero at any point in the operations. If the balance ever goes negative, it returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`. The function is designed to work with both positive and negative numbers and considers all numbers within the input list.
