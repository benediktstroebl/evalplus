```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and determines whether the balance of a bank account, initialized at zero, would fall below zero at any point during the sequence of operations. The function iterates through each operation in the input list, adding or subtracting values from the running balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If no such point is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of the loop when all operations have been processed. 

This solution is straightforward and effective, and it correctly handles the scenario of falling below zero. It does not require any external variables or additional operations, making it self-contained and directly usable as a function anywhere in other scripts.  It also follows the `below_zero` function's expected behavior, as described in the test cases provided earlier.  This is a crucial property in many real-world scenarios, such as accounting systems, banking software, and budget planning tools, where preventing negative balances is a critical requirement.  In these situations, this function can readily be used to ensure that such conditions are not breached, aiding in the detection of problematic transactions and supporting the maintenance of valid and sustainable account balances.  This contributes to the development of robust financial applications and systems.
