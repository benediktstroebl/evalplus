```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and then iterates through each value in the input list. It accumulates the balance as it goes through the transaction list. If at any point the balance falls below 0, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below 0, it returns `False`.

This solution follows the specified API and behaves as expected based on the test cases provided. It is concise and uses a simple loop to solve the problem. 

This script produces a function that solves the problem using only information provided in the markdown code block, and should pass the tests provided in the code block as well. 

Note: this solution assumes that the list of operations is cleanly formatted and will work as expected. If the input list is invalid in any way (e.g., containing non-integer values), the function may not work as expected.
