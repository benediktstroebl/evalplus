```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function iterates through the list of `operations`, summing them to the `balance`. If the `balance` dips into the negative at any point, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop if the balance remains in the realm of positive values. This approach is concise and elegantly leverages the declarative nature of Python to accomplish the task with utmost efficiency. 

This approach is also testable and qualifies all test cases mentioned in the original prompt like so:
```python
def test_below_zero():
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
    assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
    assert below_zero([0, 0, -1, 2, 5]) == True
```
