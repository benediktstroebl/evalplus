```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation represents a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money). The function initializes a variable `balance` to 0, which represents the account's balance. It then iterates through each operation in the input list, adding the operation's value to the balance. If at any point the balance falls below 0 (indicating a negative balance), the function returns True, indicating that the account's balance went below zero at least once. If no such instance is found, it returns False.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
This example mirrors the test cases given in the problem statement.
