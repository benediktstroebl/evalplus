```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It simulates the actions on the account and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. 

The script tests the function using the following inputs:
```python
# The list of operations
test_ops_true = [1, 2, -4, 5]
test_ops_false = [1, 2, 3]

# Test cases
assert below_zero(test_ops_true) == True
assert below_zero(test_ops_false) == False
```

The `assert` statements check if the function's output matches the expected outcome for the given inputs. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you would like to further clarify or explain any other concepts or problems in data structures and algorithms.
