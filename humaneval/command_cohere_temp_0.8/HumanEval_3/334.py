```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The purpose of this function is to determine whether the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

The function starts by initializing the balance of the account to zero. Then, it iterates through each element in the `operations` list. For each operation, it adds the operation's value to the current balance. If the balance becomes negative at any point (meaning there is a net withdrawal amount greater than the initial balance), the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance ever falling below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account never had a negative balance during the sequence of operations.

This solution is straightforward and efficiently determines whether the account balance falls below zero at any point. The function self-contained within the code block, and it can be dropped into any Python environment and run directly as it does not depend on any external variables or functions. 

Here are some example calls to this function, to demonstrate its correctness: 
```python
# Positive balance throughout
assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False

# Balance falls below zero
assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
``` 
The first example shows a list of operations that maintain a positive balance, and the function returns `False`. The second example shows a list that includes a net withdrawal, causing the balance to fall below zero, and the function returns `True`. 

This function provides a reliable solution for the problem statement provided, and can be used as a building block for more complex banking-related algorithms in real-world applications.
