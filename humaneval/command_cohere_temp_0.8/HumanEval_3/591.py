```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. It iterates through each value in the input list and simulates the effect of the operation on the account balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero (including if it starts negative), the function immediately returns `True`. If the balance remains non-negative after all operations, it returns `False`. 

This solution follows the problem statement and passes the tests provided. Let's break down the code and explain each part:
1. **Type Annotation**: The first line `from typing import List` imports the `List` type from the `typing` module. This is used to annotate the function signature shows that the function `below_zero` accepts a list of integers (`List[int]`) as its input. 

2. **Function Definition**: The function `below_zero` is defined with a list of integers `operations` as its argument and returns a boolean value (`Bool`). 

3. **Initialize Balance**: The variable `balance` is initialized to 0. This is a symbolic representation of the account balance, which starts with $0. As the function iterates through the list of operations, it will add (for deposits) or subtract (for withdrawals) from this `balance` to simulate the effect of each operation on the account. 

4. **Iterate Over Operations**: The function then iterates over each integer `op` in the `operations` list using a `for` loop. Inside the loop, it adds (`balance += op`) the effect of the current operation to the current balance. 

5. **Check Balance Threshold**: Immediately after performing the operation, the function checks if the balance is less than 0 (`if balance < 0`). If the balance is negative at any point, this means the account has dipped below $0, and the function returns `True`. 

6. **Return False (Good Case)**: If the loop completes without the balance ever falling below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account never fell into a negative balance. 

This code provides a clear and concise solution to the problem while maintaining efficiency and adhering to best practices with the help of type hints.  It can handle any number of deposit and withdrawal operations and accurately determines whether the account balance falls below zero at any point.  In the context of the test cases provided, this solution correctly returns `False` for the first example (`[1, 2, 3]`) and returns `True` for the second example (`[1, 2, -4, 5]`).  This solution can be further enhanced by adding more comprehensive tests to cover edge cases and validate its behavior.  This will help to ensure that the function is robust and accurately solves the problem.  Any reasonable test framework, such as `unittest` or `pytest`, can be used for this purpose.
