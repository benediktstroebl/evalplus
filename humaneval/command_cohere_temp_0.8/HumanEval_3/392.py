```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It calculates the net balance of the operations and returns `True` if the balance falls below zero at any point, indicating a deficit, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This example corresponds to the test cases provided in the problem statement. 

The function uses a simple iterative approach, it iterates through each operation in the input list, accumulating the balance while checking if it goes negative at any point. If the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If the end of the operation list is reached, and the balance is still non-negative, it returns `False`. 

This approach has a time complexity of `O(n)` since it checks each element in the list once. It is intuitive and efficiently solves the problem using basic Python capabilities.  It can easily be adapted to handle other variants of the problem or optimized further if needed.
