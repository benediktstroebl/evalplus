```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It iterates through the list of operations, accumulating a balance, and returns `True` if the balance drops to zero at any point, and `False` at the end of the operations if the balance is still positive.  This aligns with the problem statement and the provided test cases.
