```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). The function simulates the effect of these operations on a bank account's balance and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It iterates through each operation in the input list, adding the operation's value to the current balance. If the balance drops to negative at any point, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`. 

Here is an example usage illustration of the function using Python's `unittest` module:
```python
import unittest

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False

class TestBelowZeroFunction(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_with_positive_values(self):
        self.assertFalse(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))

    def test_with_negative_values(self):
        self.assertTrue(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))

    def test_with_mixed_values(self):
        self.assertFalse(below_zero([3, -2, 4, -1, 2]))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
``` 

In this illustration, the `unittest` module is utilized to group multiple test cases within the `TestBelowZeroFunction` class. Each test case is defined by a method named starting with `test_`, followed by a descriptive name. Inside each of these methods, the `assert*` methods are used to confirm whether the function's output matches the expected result. When executed, the `unittest` framework runs all the test cases and displays the results, highlighting any failed tests and providing further information to pinpoint any discrepancies between expected and actual results. 

The `if __name__ == '__main__':` line ensures that the test suite only runs when the script is executed directly and not when it's imported elsewhere, providing further organization and usability. 

This way, the `below_zero` function is validated against various test cases, assuring its correctness and adaptability to different scenarios.
