```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after executing a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. It iterates through each value in the input list, simulating the effects of the corresponding transactions on the account balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If no such scenario is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of the loop, implying that the account's balance remained non-negative throughout the operations. 

This solution follows the specification and provides the correct output for the given test cases.
