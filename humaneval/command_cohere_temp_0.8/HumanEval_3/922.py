```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function iterates through each operation in the list, updating the running balance by adding the `op`. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at some point. If no such instance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations. 

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem statement. It also follows Python's idiomatic style and uses typed variables, which are optional in this case but can provide benefits in readability and future proofing.
