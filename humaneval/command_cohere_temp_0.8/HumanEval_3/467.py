```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations `ops` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates a running balance of the bank account. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If the entire list of operations is processed without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`. This function detects if the balance of the account ever falls below zero and returns `True` or `False` accordingly.  This matches the specified test cases.
