```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations `List[int]` as input. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates them into a running balance using an initial balance of 0. If at any point the balance falls below 0, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at some point. If no such instance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations.

This solution follows the prompt's expectations, where the function returns `True` for tests like `[1, 2, -4, 5]` and `False` for `[1, 2, 3]`.
