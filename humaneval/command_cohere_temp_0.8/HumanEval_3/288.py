```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the progression of the account's balance after each operation and checks if it falls below zero at any point. If the balance ever goes negative, it returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This solution follows the problem statement and passes the tests provided. Let's break down the code:
1. **Type Hints**: The first line imports the `List` type from the `typing` module, allowing us to annotate the function's parameter with a list of integers. 
2. **Declaration and Initialization**: The `balance` variable is initialized to 0, representing the initial balance of the account.
3. **Simulation of Account Operations**: The `for` loop iterates through each operation in the `operations` list. For each operation, it adds it to the current balance to simulate the effect of that operation on the account.
4. **Threshold Check**: After each operation, the function checks if the balance is less than 0. If this happens at any point, it means the account balance fell below zero, and the function returns `True`.
5. **Completion**: If the loop completes without the account balance falling below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account never fell into a negative balance. 
This simple and efficient solution directly tackles the core of the problem and provides the desired result. 

The tests included in the problem statement would ensure this function's correctness since they cover a variety of scenarios, including a growing balance, a declining balance, and a balance that becomes negative.
