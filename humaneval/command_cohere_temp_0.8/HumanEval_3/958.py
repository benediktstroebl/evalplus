```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, representing deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. It maintains a running balance and checks whether the balance falls below zero at any point in the operations. If the balance ever goes negative, it returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`. The function is designed to work with both positive and negative numbers, allowing for deposits and withdrawals. 

This solution is concise and straightforward, directly iterating through the operations and checking the balance, without any additional variables or complex logic. It passes the given tests and provides correct functionality as described in the problem statement.  It handles various scenarios, including both positive and negative operations, and correctly determines if the balance falls below zero at any point.
