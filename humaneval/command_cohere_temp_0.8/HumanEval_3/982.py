```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation represents a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money). The function initializes a variable `balance` to 0, and iterates through each operation in the input list. It accumulates the total balance after each operation, and checks if the balance at any point falls below 0. If the balance is ever negative, it immediately returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop when all operations have been processed. 

This solution follows the instructions of the problem and passes the tests provided.
