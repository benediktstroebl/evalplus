```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). The function iterates through each operation in the list, updating the balance by adding the effect of each operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at some point. If no such scenario is encountered, it returns `False` at the end. 

This solution is concise and efficiently detects the condition of the account balance going below zero at any point in the sequence of operations. 
The `below_zero` function's behavior is explained using a markdown code block, and it includes test cases to verify its correctness. 

```python
# Test case for the below_zero function

def test_below_zero():
    # Single positive integer, so balance remains 0
    assert not below_zero([1])
    # Single negative integer, so balance goes negative
    assert below_zero([-1])
    # Multiple operations, with both positive and negative integers
    assert below_zero([1, 2, -3, 4])
    # Multiple operations, all positive integers
    assert not below_zero([1, 2, 3])
    # Single operation, which is 0
    assert not below_zero([0])
    # Multiple operations, with 0 in between
    assert not below_zero([-3, 0, 2])
``` 

This completes the detailed explanation of the `below_zero` function, its implementation, and its behavior with illustrative test cases.
