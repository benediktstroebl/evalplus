```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `List[int]` and calculates the ending balance after each operation. If the balance goes negative at any point, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The script passes the given tests of returning `False` for the first test and `True` for the second test. 
The function includes type annotations, indicating that the function takes a list of integers as input and returns a boolean. These type annotations help ensure proper usage of the function and improve code readability. Mentioning this to ensure completeness, however, in the context of this challenge, type annotations are not required. Nonetheless, they do provide benefits in terms of code structure and readability, as you mentioned.
