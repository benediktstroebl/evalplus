```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. The function iterates through each value in the input list and simulates the state of the account balance after each operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns `False`.

This solution follows the prompt's expectations, as it returns `True` for the input `[1, 2, -4, 5]` and `False` for the input `[1, 2, 3]`.
