```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point after executing the operations, and `False` otherwise.

The function starts by initializing the balance to zero and then iterates through each operation in the input list. For each operation, it adds it to the current balance. If the balance becomes negative at any point, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`. 

This solution follows the official convention of using a single function with a clear purpose and an informative name. Such an approach makes the code more readable and easier to maintain. 

This script can be tested against the test cases mentioned earlier to verify its correctness. 
```python
# Test the function with some sample inputs
> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False

> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
This should return `False` for the first test case and `True` for the second test case, as expected.
