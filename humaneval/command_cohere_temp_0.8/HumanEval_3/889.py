```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script introduces an iterative approach to simulating the bank account operations. The cumulative balance after each operation is recorded and checked against zero. Ultimately, it returns True if the balance ever falls below zero, and False otherwise. This method is more efficient than the recursive approach provided before, especially for long operation lists with repetitive operations. 

This approach improves efficiency to O(n), where n is the length of the operations list.
