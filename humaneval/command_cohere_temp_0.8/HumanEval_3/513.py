```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each value in the input list. It simulates a bank account where each item in the list can be either a deposit or withdrawal, represented by positive or negative integers, respectively. It keeps a running total of the balance and checks whether it goes negative at any point. If it does, the function returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once. If no negative balance is encountered, it returns `False`.

This solution follows the prompt's expected functionality as it correctly identifies situations where the account balance falls below zero. 

This code is concise and follows Python best practices.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list. This is because it iterates through each element exactly once, performing a constant-time operation on each.
