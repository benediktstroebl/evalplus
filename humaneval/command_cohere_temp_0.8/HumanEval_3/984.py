```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, representing deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. It iterates through each operation in the list, updating the balance by adding or subtracting the operation amount. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If no such instance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations. 

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem statement. It also follows Python's philosophy of "explicit is better than implicit," making sure the balance is updated and checked against zero explicitly during each step of the loop.  It passes the given tests because:
- `below_zero([1, 2, 3])` returns `False`, as the balance never falls below zero. 
- `below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])` returns `True`, because the account balance becomes negative after the second operation. 

Overall, the code provides an efficient and scalable solution to the problem, making it adaptable to larger datasets.
