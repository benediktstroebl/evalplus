```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation representing a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money) on a bank account. The function calculates the net balance after each operation and checks if it falls below zero at any point. If the balance ever goes negative, it returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`.

The function is designed to efficiently handle the scenario of a negative balance and directly returns the desired output without any extra complexity. 

This solution adheres to Python's best practices and modern conventions, making the code readable and maintainable.
