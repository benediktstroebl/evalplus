```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function iterates through the list of operations, accumulating the balance while keeping track of the current total. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`. 

This solution follows the prompt's expected output when tested with the provided test cases:
```python
# Test case 1
assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False

# Test case 2
assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
```

This script provides an effective solution to the problem as described in the prompt. You can integrate it into a broader solution if needed.
