```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function takes a list of `operations` as an argument, representing deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. It iterates through each operation in the list, accumulating the balance of the account. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, it returns `False`.

This solution follows the problem statement and passes the given tests. Let's break down the solution and discuss its correctness:
1. **Typing Module**: The first line imports the typing module, which is used to annotate the function with type hints. Type hints improve code readability and provide hints to the Python interpreter about the expected types of function arguments and return values, making the code more readable and maintainable.
2. **List of Ints**: The function `below_zero` is defined with a single parameter `operations`, which is expected to be a list of integers. This is specified using the List[int] type hint.
3. **Initializing Balance**: The variable `balance` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the current balance of the bank account as we iterate through the list of operations.
4. **Iterating Through Operations**: The function then iterates through each element `op` in the `operations` list using a `for` loop. In each iteration, it adds the `op` value to the `balance` to simulate the effect of that operation on the account balance.
5. **Checking Balance**: After each operation, the function checks if the `balance` is less than 0. If it is, this indicates that the account balance fell below zero at least once during the operations, and the function returns `True`. If the balance never falls below zero, it returns `False` after processing all operations.

This function solves the problem of detecting whether the account balance falls below zero at any point during the given operations, and it does so in a self-contained manner, independent of any external variables or configurations.
