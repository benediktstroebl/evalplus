```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation representing a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money) on a bank account. The function keeps a running balance as it iterates through the operations, and returns `True` immediately once the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. 

This solution makes use of Python's strong typing and type inference capabilities, where the type of `operations` is declared as `List[int]`, and the function can correctly infer the type of `op` as `int` during each iteration step. 

This approach allows for a simple and elegant solution that is both easy to read and highly efficient, executing in O(n), where `n` is the length of the input list. 

This solution can be tested quite simply, as shown in the accompanying markdown code block that accompanies this response.
