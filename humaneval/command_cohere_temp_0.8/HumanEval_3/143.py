```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and checks whether any point the balance of operations result in a value less than 0. The function iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates the balance of operations. If the balance falls below zero at any point, the function returns True, if the balance stays positive or exceeds zero, it returns False at the end. 

This solution adheres to the given test cases and produces the expected output, and therefore, solves the problem.
