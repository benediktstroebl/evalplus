```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if at any point the balance of operations falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function iterates through each operation in the list, updating the running balance by adding each operation. If the balance drops to a negative value at any point, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop if the balance is still zero. 

Here is an example usage of this code:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This example usage demonstrates the function's behavior, returning `False` for a balanced list of operations and `True` for an unbalanced list that causes the balance to fall below zero.
