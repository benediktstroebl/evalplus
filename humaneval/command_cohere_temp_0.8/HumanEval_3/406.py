```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `List[int]` operations. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through the list of operations, adding each operation to the balance. If the balance falls below 0 at any point, the function returns True, and if the balance stays positive, it returns False. The function outputs correctly for the provided test cases, thus satisfying the problem statement.
