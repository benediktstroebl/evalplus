```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and simulates the effect of that operation on a bank account balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, it returns `False`. 

The function's type hint `List[int]` indicates that it expects the input list to contain integer values, representing either deposit or withdrawal amounts. 

This solution is concise and straightforward, directly answering the problem statement without excessive complexity. It leverages basic Python logic and typing to achieve the desired outcome.  This function can be easily copied and pasted into a Python environment or script to solve the specific problem of detecting account balance going below zero.
