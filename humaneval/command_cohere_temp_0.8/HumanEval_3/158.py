```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. It does so by iterating through each value in the input list and simulating the effect of each operation on the account balance.

The function starts by initializing the balance to zero. It then iterates through each element `op` in the input `operations` list. For each operation, it adds the operation's value to the current balance. This simulates the effect of a deposit or withdrawal on the account balance.

During this process, if the balance ever falls below zero (meaning there is a negative balance), the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at some point during the operations. If the loop completes without the balance ever falling below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero.

This approach takes advantage of short-circuit evaluation in Python. The logic is optimized because Python doesn't evaluate the entire loop if it finds that the condition is met (the balance falling below zero). This helps ensure that the function returns the correct result in the least amount of time.

This script provides a concise and efficient solution to the problem, directly addressing the requirement to detect whether the account balance can fall below zero during the sequence of operations.
