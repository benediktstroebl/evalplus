```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The task is to determine whether the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

The function sets the initial balance to zero and then iterates through each element in the `operations` list. It updates the balance by adding the value of each operation (deposit or withdrawal) to the current balance. After each operation, it checks if the balance has become negative. If the balance is negative at any point, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the balance fell below zero at least once. If the loop completes without the balance ever going negative, it returns `False`, indicating that the balance never fell below zero.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations, as it requires iterating through all the operations only once to determine the outcome. It is an efficient solution for solving the problem.
