```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and determines whether the balance of a bank account, initialized at zero, would fall below zero at any point when applying the given operations. It iterates through each operation in the input list, adding them to the running balance. If the balance ever becomes negative, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance falls below zero at that point. If no such occurrence happens during all the operations, it returns `False` at the end, suggesting a non-negative balance throughout. 

This solution is straightforward to understand and will correctly solve the problem, making it a viable option for the stated challenge. 

You can use the function as demonstrated in the provided test cases to check if it meets your expectations. 
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
This would verify the functionality and correctness of the function.  If you need assistance with any other related Python challenges, don't hesitate to ask!
