```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The function monitors the balance of the account and returns `True` if at any point the account balance falls below zero, indicating a deficit. If the account balance remains non-negative throughout all the operations, it returns `False`. 

This solution covers all possible scenarios of account operations, including multiple deposits and withdrawals in any order, and accurately tracks the account balance to determine if it falls below zero at any point. 

This approach has an time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations, since it iterates through the operations list just once, and performs constant time operations to update the balance and check for deficit.  This makes it an efficient solution that accurately solves the problem.  It passes test cases such as `[1, 2, 3]` and `[1, 2, -4, 5]` as expected.
