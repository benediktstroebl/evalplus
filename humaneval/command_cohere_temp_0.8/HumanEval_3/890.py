```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). It iterates through each operation in the list, accumulating the balance of the bank account. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If the loop completes without the balance ever going negative, it returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero for any point in the given operations. 

Here is a simple test to validate the functionality of the function:
```python
test_cases = [
    ([1, 2, 3], False),
    ([1, 2, -4, 5], True),
    ([-10, 5, -3, 7], True),
    ([10, 5, 3, -7], False),
]

for ops, expected in test_cases:
    actual = below_zero(ops)
    assert actual == expected, f"For operations {ops}, expected {expected} but got {actual}"
``` 

This test covers multiple scenarios with different operations and verifies that the function returns the expected result for each case.  The code ensures that the function is correct and matches the given test cases.  It can be directly used in the markdown code block specified in the problem statement.
