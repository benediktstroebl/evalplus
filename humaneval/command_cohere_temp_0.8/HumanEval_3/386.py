```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). The function iterates through each operation in the list, updating the balance by adding the operation's value. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If no such instance is found, it returns `False`.

The docstring includes helpful examples that demonstrate the behavior of the function for different input scenarios.
