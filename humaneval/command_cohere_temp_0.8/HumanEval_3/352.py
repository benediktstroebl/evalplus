```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each operation in the input list.

For each operation, it adds it to the current balance (withdrawal if the operation is negative, deposit if positive). It then checks if the balance falls below 0 at any point, indicating a deficit. If the balance ever goes negative, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance going negative, it returns `False`, indicating that the balance never fell below zero during the given operations.

The function is designed to efficiently handle the task of detecting account balance going below zero in a list of operations, providing a boolean result based on the provided input.
