```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each value in the input list. It accumulates the balance as it iterates through the operations. If at any point the balance falls below 0, it immediately returns True, indicating that the balance went negative at some point. If no negative balance is encountered after processing all operations, it returns False.

Here is an example usage of this function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
>>> below_zero([-10, -5, -20, -15, -5, -1])
True
``` 

In the first example, the function returns `False` because the balance never goes below zero despite being positive. In the second example, the function returns `True` because the balance falls below zero due to the withdrawal of 4 units. The last example also returns `True` because the account balance never recovers to positive and falls further down each operation.
