```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `List[int]` and returns a boolean indicating whether the balance of operations falls below zero. It iterates through each operation in the list, accumulating the balance, and returns `True` if the balance falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. It assumes that the input list contains only integer operations.  This function is straightforward and effective in handling the problem.
