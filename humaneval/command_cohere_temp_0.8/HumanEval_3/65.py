```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and checks whether any point the balance of operations result in a value less than 0. The function updates the balance variable by adding the value of each operation in the input list. If the balance ever goes negative, the function returns True, if the balance remains positive, it returns False. 

Here is an example usage of this function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

This would return False and True for the respective cases. 
This function's behavior aligns with the problem statement's expected functionality, as it determines whether the balance falls below zero at any point.  This is achieved by iterating through the given sequence of operations and calculating the account balance accordingly. 
The function returns True if the balance falls below zero at any point in the operations list, and False otherwise.  This solution is efficient and directly answers the problem statement.
