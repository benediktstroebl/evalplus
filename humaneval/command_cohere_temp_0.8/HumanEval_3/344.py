```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if at any point the balance of operations falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function iterates through each operation in the list, accumulating the balance, and returns `True` if the balance ever becomes negative. The function returns `False` if the balance never becomes negative. 

Here is an example usage output:
```python
>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
```python
>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
``` 
This corresponds to the example usage provided in the problem statement.
