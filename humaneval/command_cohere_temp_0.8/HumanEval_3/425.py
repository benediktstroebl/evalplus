```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if at any point the balance of operations falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function increments the `balance` with each operation, and triggers a spike when the balance dips below zero. 
```py
below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) -> True
below_zero([1, 2, 3]) -> False
``` 
This corresponds to the intended behavior as described in the prompt.
