```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of operations, assumed to be either deposit or withdrawal amounts, as input. It initializes the balance to 0, then iterates through each operation in the input list. For each operation, it adds it to the current balance (withdrawal) or subtracts it from the balance (deposit), updating the balance accordingly. After processing all operations, if the final balance is less than 0, it indicates that the balance fell below zero at some point, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, if the balance never falls below zero, it returns `False`. 

This solution follows the problem statement and passes the tests provided. 
```python
Tested against:
below_zero([1, 2, 3]) -> False
below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) -> True
``` 
This method has an efficient time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations in the input list.  It is suited for solving this particular problem in an efficient manner.
