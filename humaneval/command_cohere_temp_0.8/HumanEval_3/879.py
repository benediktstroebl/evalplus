```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each value in the input list. It accumulates the balance as it iterates through the operations, and it returns `True` immediately once the balance falls below 0, and `False` otherwise. This code correctly solves the problem in a straightforward manner.
