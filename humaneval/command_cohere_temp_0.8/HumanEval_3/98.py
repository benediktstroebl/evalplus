```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of a bank account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after executing all the given deposit and withdrawal operations. It does so in an iterative fashion, summing up each operation in the input list and updating the balance accordingly. 

The function returns `True` immediately once it detects that the account balance has fallen below $0 at any point during the operations, indicating that the account balance did fall below zero. If the account balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, it returns `False`. 

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem, as indicated by the test cases provided. It also adheres to Python's typing conventions by using the `List[int]` type annotation.
