```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). It iterates through each operation in the list, updating the balance by adding the operation's value. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account's balance went below zero at some point. If no such instance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations. 

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem statement. It also follows Python's principle of "One Right Way" by using explicit loops instead of recursion, which makes the code more efficient and easier to read and debug.
