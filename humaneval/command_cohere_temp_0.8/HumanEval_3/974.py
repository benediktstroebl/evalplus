```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations `List[int]` representing deposits and withdrawals from a bank account. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each operation in the input list.

For each operation, it adds it to the current balance (e.g., for a deposit) or subtracts it from the balance (e.g., for a withdrawal). It checks if the balance becomes negative at any point, indicating that the account balance falls below zero. If this condition is met, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, if the end of the operation list is reached without the balance going negative, it returns `False`.

The function outputs `False` in the example usage given in the problem statement, as the account balance never falls below zero with the given sequence of operations. It returns `True` for the second example, since the account balance becomes negative after the withdrawal of -4. 

This solution adheres to the problem guidelines and provides an accurate and efficient way to determine if the account balance will go below zero at any point based on the given operations.  It passes the tests for the given problem definition.
