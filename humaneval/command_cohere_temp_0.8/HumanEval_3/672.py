```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations `List[int]` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and calculates the running balance of the bank account. If the balance ever falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the balance went negative at some point. If no negative balance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of the loop when all operations are processed. 

This solution follows Python's idiomatic style and leverages typing for better code readability and maintainability. It also makes use of a simple loop and a shared variable to perform the task. 

This approach results in a straightforward solution that is both testable and easily understandable. It also provides clear documentation with inline comments to explain the functionality, making it accessible even to those unfamiliar with the problem domain.
