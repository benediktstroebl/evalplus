```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and checks whether any point the balance of operations will be below zero or not. The function loops through the operations and accumulates the balance accordingly. Whenever the balance goes below zero, the function returns `True`, if the loop completes and the balance is still zero, it returns `False`. 

This solution adheres to the problem's requirements and corresponds to the provided tests.
