```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function returns True if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point after applying the given operations, and False otherwise.

To accomplish this, it maintains a running balance of the operations, initially set to zero. It iterates through the list of operations, adding each operation to the balance. If the balance falls below zero at any point, it immediately returns True. If the end of the operations is reached and the balance is still non-negative, it returns False.

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem statement. It can efficiently handle any list of operations and determine whether the balance falls below zero at any point.
