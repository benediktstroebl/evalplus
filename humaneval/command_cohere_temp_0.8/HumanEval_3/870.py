```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an operation on the account, such as a deposit or withdrawal. The task is to determine whether the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

The function starts by initializing the balance of the account to zero. Then, it iterates through each operation in the `operations` list. For each operation, it updates the balance by adding or subtracting the value of the operation. If the balance becomes negative at any point during this process, it means the account balance fell below zero, and the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance ever falling below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never went negative throughout the sequence of operations.
