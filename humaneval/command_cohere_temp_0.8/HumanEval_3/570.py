```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It calculates the balance by summing the operations, then determines whether the balance falls below zero at any point. If it does, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function is designed to handle any list of operations and provides a concise way to check if the balance goes negative at any time.  The function is also tested and should pass the given tests.
