```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations `List[int]` representing deposits and withdrawals from a bank account. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each operation in the input list.

For each operation, it adds it to the current balance (e.g., for a deposit) or subtracts it from the balance (e.g., for a withdrawal). It returns `True` immediately if the balance falls below 0 at any point, indicating that the account balance went negative at some point during the operations. If no such instance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of the loop when the balance is still non-negative. 

The function is designed to efficiently handle the scenario of account balance going below zero and provides the correct output for the given test cases.
