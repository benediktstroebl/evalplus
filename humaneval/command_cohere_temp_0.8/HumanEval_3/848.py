```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of a bank account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after executing all the given deposit and withdrawal operations.

The function uses a simple loop to iterate through each operation in the input list. It updates the current balance by adding the value of each operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went negative at some point. If all operations are executed and the final balance is still non-negative, it returns `False`.

This solution is straightforward and efficiently determines whether the account balance falls below zero at any point during the operations. And it does this without needing to store all the intermediate balances, as it only needs to track the balance since the last operation.
