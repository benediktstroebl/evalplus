```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each value in the input list. It simulates a bank account where each value in the input list could be a deposit or withdrawal operation (positive or negative integer). It keeps a running balance and checks whether the balance falls below 0 at any point. If it does, the function returns `True`, and if the balance never falls below zero, it returns `False`.

Here is an example usage of this function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This would return `False` and `True` for the respective inputs as it does not go below zero in the first example and does go below zero in the second example.  This function's behavior is aligned with the problem statement's requirements.  It is self-contained and should be easy to integrate into tests or other codebases that need a solution for this specific problem.
