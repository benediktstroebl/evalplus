```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after executing a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. It does so in the following ways:
1. **Type Declaration**: The function starts by importing the `List` module from the `typing` module. This declaration indicates that the function expects a list of values as input.
2. **List Iteration**: It initializes a variable `balance` to zero, representing the current balance of the account. It then iterates through each element `op` in the input `operations` list.
3. **Update Balance**: In each iteration, it adds the `op` value to the `balance` to simulate the effect of the operation on the account balance.
4. **Check Balance**: If at any point the `balance` becomes less than zero (`< 0`), it means the account balance has fallen below zero, and the function returns `True`. If no such negative balance is encountered, it continues iterating through the list.
5. **End of Iteration**: After processing all operations, if the `balance` is still zero (or any non-negative value), the function returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero during the given operations.

The function is demonstrated to work correctly with the given test cases in the original problem.
