```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (of type `List[int]`), and returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point in the operations, and `False` otherwise.

In the function, the balance is initialized to zero. Then, it iterates through each operation in the input list. For each operation, it adds it to the current balance. If the balance becomes negative at any point, it returns `True` as this is the criteria for the problem. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`. 

This solution is efficient in terms of time complexity and passes the provided tests respectively.
