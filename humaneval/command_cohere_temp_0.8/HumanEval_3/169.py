```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function iterates through the list of `operations`, summing them to the `balance`. If the `balance` falls below 0 at any point, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of iteration if the `balance` remained non-negative. 

This approach assumes that each element in the list `operations` is either a deposit or withdrawal operation on the bank account, with no partial transactions. 

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the `operations` list, making it efficient for large inputs. 

To see the function in action, you can run it with the following calls: 
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
The first call returns `False` since the balance never falls below zero. The second call returns `True` since the balance becomes negative after the third operation.
