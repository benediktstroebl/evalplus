```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of a bank account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after executing all the given deposit and withdrawal operations. It does so in the following way:
- The function initialize a variable `balance` to 0, which represents the initial balance of the account.
- It then iterates through each value in the input `operations` list, adding each operation `op` to the balance. 
- If at any point the `balance` falls below 0, it means there was a withdrawal that caused the account balance to go into a negative state. In this case, the function immediately returns True.
- If the loop completes without the balance falling below 0, it means all operations kept the account balance non-negative, and the function returns False.

The function returns False if the balance never falls below zero, and True if it falls below zero at any point. This functionality is demonstrated through test cases in the original problem statement provided, and shown to work in the following way:
```
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
This helps demonstrate how the function correctly identifies the scenario where the account balance falls below zero due to a series of operations.
