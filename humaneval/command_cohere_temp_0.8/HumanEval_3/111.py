```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and simulates the effect of that operation on a bank account balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, it returns `False`. 

This solution is concise and straightforward, and it correctly handles the scenario of checking if the account balance falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations. 

This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations in the input list, making it efficient for larger datasets.
