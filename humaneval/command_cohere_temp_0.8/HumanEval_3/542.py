```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function iterates through the list of operations, accumulating the balance, and returns `True` if the balance ever falls below zero, otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Here is some example test code to ensure the function operates as expected:
```python
def test_below_zero():
    # Below tests are taken from the example test cases provided in the problem statement
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
    assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
    assert below_zero([0, 0, -1, 2, 3]) == True
    assert below_zero([-5, -10, -15, -20]) == True
``` 

This test suite will thoroughly test the `below_zero` function with a variety of inputs to ensure it operates as expected.
