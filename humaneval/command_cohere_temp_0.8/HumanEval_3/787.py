```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if at any point the balance of operations falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function iterates through each operation in the list, accumulating the balance, and returns `True` as soon as the balance hits or goes below zero, otherwise it returns `False` at the end of the iteration if the full computation has a balance non-negative. 

This solution does not require any additional libraries like Numpy or PyTorch, keeping the solution self-contained. 
```python
import numpy as np

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    # convert operations to a NumPy array for vectorized operations
    operations = np.array(operations)
    balance = np.zeros_like(operations)
    # iterate through operations and update balance using NumPy
    for i in range(balance.size):
        balance[i] += operations[i]
    # check if any balance is negative
    return np.any(balance < 0)
```

This solution utilizes NumPy for vectorized operations and may be more efficient for large inputs, as it reduces the number of calculations involved, but it is not self-contained, as it relies on the NumPy library.
