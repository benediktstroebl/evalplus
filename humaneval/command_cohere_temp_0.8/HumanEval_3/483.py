```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. It does so by iterating through each value in the input list and simulating the effect of each operation on the account balance.

The function starts by initializing the balance to zero. It then iterates through each element `op` in the input `operations` list. For each operation, it adds the operation's value to the current balance. This simulates the effect of a deposit or withdrawal operation on the account balance.

During each iteration, if the balance becomes less than zero, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at some point during the operations. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero. 

Here is an example usage of this function:
```python
# Test the function
assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
```

This tests the function with both valid and invalid input, asserting that the function returns the correct result for each scenario.  Overall, the `below_zero` function provides a simple and reliable way to determine whether an account balance can fall below zero after a series of operations, making it a useful tool for banking and finance-related applications.
