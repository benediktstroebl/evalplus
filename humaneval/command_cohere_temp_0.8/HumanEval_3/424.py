```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations, iterates through them, and accumulates the balance of the bank account accordingly. If the balance ever goes negative, it immediately returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations if the balance remained non-negative. The function is designed to efficiently handle the mentioned problem and is tested for the specified use case.
