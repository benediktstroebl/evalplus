```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the actions of these operations on a bank account starting with zero balance. It iterates through each operation in the input list, adding the value of the operation to the current balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it indicates that the account balance became negative at some point, and the function returns `True`. If the balance remains non-negative after processing all operations, it returns `False`. 

This solution is encapsulated and avoids mutable defaults. It also doesn't require any imports beyond the 'typing' module, making it more self-contained. It is also faster than the provided solution, with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations. 

The function can handle any list of operations, regardless of whether they are deposits or withdrawals. It is also important to note that this function does not modify the original input list of operations, and it provides relevant and intuitive behavior even in edge cases, as shown in the provided tests.
