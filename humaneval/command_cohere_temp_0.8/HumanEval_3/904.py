```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if at any point the balance of operations falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function iterates through each operation in the list, accumulating the balance, and returns `True` if the balance drops to zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. It is important to note that this algorithm assumes that the list of operations is executed in order. Hence, the order of the list is an important factor when considering the resultant boolean value.
