```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. The function iterates through each operation in the list and updates the running balance accordingly. If the balance drops to a negative value at any point, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop if the account balance remains non-negative.  This solution relies on the assumption that the list covers all transactions that occurred on the account, and it is scoped to only consider the transactions passed.
