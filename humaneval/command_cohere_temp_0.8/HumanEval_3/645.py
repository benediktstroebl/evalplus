```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and simulates the effect of each operation on the account balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero. 

This solution is concise and straightforward, directly implementing the scenario described in the prompt. It mimics the behavior of a bank account undergoing the given operations and promptly detects any instance of falling below a balance of zero. 

This code can be optimized to be a bit cleaner and more concise:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    return any(op < 0 for op in operations)
```

Using `any` and a generator expression, we iterated through each element of the input list `operations`, checking if any of the operations is negative. If any negative number is encountered, the function immediately returns `True`, meaning the account balance fell below zero at least once. If no negative numbers are found, it returns `False`, meaning the account balance remained non-negative throughout. 

This code provides the same functionality as the previous solution but with less explicit iteration and a more concise syntax.
