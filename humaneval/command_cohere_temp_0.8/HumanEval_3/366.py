```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the effect of these operations on a bank account starting with a balance of zero, updating the balance after each operation. It returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, indicating a deficit, and `False` otherwise. 

The function uses a simple loop to iterate through the operations list, adding each operation to the balance. If at any point the balance becomes negative, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`. 

This solution is concise and efficient, with a time complexity of `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the `operations` list.
