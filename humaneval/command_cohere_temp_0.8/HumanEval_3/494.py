```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation representing a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money) on a bank account. The function iterates through each operation, updating the running balance and returns `True` if the balance ever falls below zero, indicating that the account is in a deficit at some point during the operations, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
# Test the function with a list of operations
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
```

This will output:
```bash
False
True
```
