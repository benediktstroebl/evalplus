```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of operations as input, where each operation is represented as an integer (positive for deposits, and negative for withdrawals). The function simulates the progression of the bank account balance after each operation, and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It uses a for loop to iterate through each operation in the list, adding them to the balance. If the balance falls below zero at any point, it returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This example corresponds to the aforementioned test cases provided in the original problem description.
