```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and checks whether any point the balance of operations result in a negative number. This function returns True if the balance falls below zero at any point, and False otherwise. It uses a for loop to iterate through each element in the input list and adds each operation to the running balance. If the balance becomes negative at any point, it immediately returns True. If all operations are non-negative, it returns False.  This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the operations list.  This is because it iterates through each element in the list exactly once, performing a constant-time operation on each element.
