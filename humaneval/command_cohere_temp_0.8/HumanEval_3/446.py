```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). The function simulates the progression of the bank account's balance after each operation, and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It uses a `typing` list to enforce the input type, and uses a loop and an auxiliary variable `balance ` to keep track of the account's balance as it processes the operations.  This approach is efficient and has a time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of operations. 

This code can be tested with the following markdown:
```
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
This will help verify the functionality of the script.
