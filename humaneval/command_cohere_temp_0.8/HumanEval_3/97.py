```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script introduces an iterative approach to account activity simulation and balance tracking. Within the loop, each operation is executed, and the balance is updated accordingly. Ultimately, the function returns True if the balance ever falls below zero, underscoring the presence of a negative balance at any point in the transaction list. If such a scenario does not unfold, the function returns False. 

This approach guarantees a correct solution to the problem while maintaining efficiency in tracking the account balance as operations are executed one by one.
