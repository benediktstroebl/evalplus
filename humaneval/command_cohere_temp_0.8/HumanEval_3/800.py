```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function iterates through the list of `operations`, summing them to the `balance`. Whenever the `balance` falls below zero, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop if the `balance` remains non-negative. The markdown cell with tests is left empty since the problem statement already includes self-contained tests.
