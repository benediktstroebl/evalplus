```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and calculates the current balance after applying each operation. If the balance falls below zero at any point, the function returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop when the balance is still zero.
