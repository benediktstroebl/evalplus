```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and simulates the effect of that operation on a bank account balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, it returns `False`. 

This solution is concise and correctly matches the specified behavior of the problem statement. 

This code can be brought to production immediately but may require additional input validation for cases such as empty lists or non-integer values in the list, depending on the context in which it is used.
