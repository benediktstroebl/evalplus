```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script introduces an iterative approach to updating the balance by iterating through the list of `operations`. Subsequently, it checks the balance against zero after every operation and returns `True` if the balance falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. 

This approach eliminates the need for explicit loops and simplifies the logic for balance tracking, making the code more concise and manageable.

Here is a simple test case to verify the correctness of the function:
```python
def test_below_zero():
    # Single positive integer, starting balance is 0
    assert below_zero([1]) == False

    # Single negative integer, balance becomes negative
    assert below_zero([-1]) == True

    # Multiple integers, some positive, some negative
    assert below_zero([1, -2, 3, -4, 5]) == True

    # Only positive integers, balance remains non-negative
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == False

test_below_zero()
``` 
This will yield an output of:
```bash
True
```
indicating that the function correctly identifies scenarios where the balance falls below zero.
