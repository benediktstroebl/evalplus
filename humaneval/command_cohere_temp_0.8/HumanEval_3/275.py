```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. It does so by iterating through each value in the input list and simulating the effect of each operation on the account balance.

The function starts by initializing the balance to zero. It then iterates through each element `op` in the input `operations` list. For each operation, it adds the operation's value to the current balance. This simulates the effect of a deposit or withdrawal operation on the account balance.

During this process, if the balance ever falls below zero, it means the account balance became negative at some point, indicating a failure in the transaction series. In such a case, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once during the sequence of operations. 

If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it means all the operations kept the account balance non-negative throughout, and the function returns `False`, indicating that the account never fell below zero during the sequence of operations.

This `below_zero` function passes both test cases mentioned in the prompt:
1. `below_zero([1, 2, 3])` returns `False`, correctly identifying that the account balance never falls below zero with the given sequence of operations. 
2. `below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])` returns `True`, correctly identifying that the account balance falls below zero with the given sequence of operations. 

It does so without altering the starting balance of the account or exceeding the call stack limit, making it highly efficient and more robust compared to recursive solutions.
