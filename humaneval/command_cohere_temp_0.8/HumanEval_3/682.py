```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It iterates through the list of operations, accumulating a balance, and returns `True` if the balance falls negative at any point, and `False` otherwise. It is designed to handle both positive and negative operations and will return the correct result for any valid input list of operations. 

Here is an example usage of the function to test its correctness: 
```python
# Test the function with a list of operations
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # Should print False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Should print True
``` 
The function should return the expected outputs which are `False` and `True` respectively.
