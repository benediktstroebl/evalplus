```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation representing a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money) on a bank account. The function calculates the net balance after each operation and checks if it goes below zero at any point. If the balance falls below zero at any moment, it immediately returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop if no such instance is found. 

This solution follows the given test examples provided in the problem context:
- `below_zero([1, 2, 3])` returns `False` since the balance never falls below zero.
- `below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])` returns `True` since the balance becomes negative after the third operation.
