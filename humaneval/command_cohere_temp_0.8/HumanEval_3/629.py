```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of operations, presumed to be deposits and withdrawals, on a bank account. The function iterates through each operation in the list, simulating the effect of each operation on the account balance. It keeps track of the running total `balance`. Then, if at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went negative at some point. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, it returns `False`.

This solution follows the prompt's expected behavior, returning `True` for tests like `[1, 2, -4, 5]` and `False` for `[1, 2, 3]`.  This is because the former case involves a withdrawal (-4) that brings the balance to negative, while the latter is a series of deposits and the balance remains positive.  This function is also scalable and will work with any number of operations and different kinds of operations (deposits or withdrawals), as long as they keep the balance moving. 

Note: be mindful of the assumption that all the operations in the list are either deposits or withdrawals and the impact of other erroneous operations on the account balance.
