```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each value in the input list. It assumes each integer represents an operation on a bank account where a positive integer represents a deposit, and a negative integer represents a withdrawal. It keeps a running balance of these operations and returns `True` if the balance falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is an example:
```python
# Test the function with positive operations only
assert not below_zero([1, 2, 3])

# Test the function with a mix of positive and negative operations
assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
``` 

This will run the function with different inputs to ensure it is working correctly.
