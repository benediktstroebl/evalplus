```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation can be either a deposit or withdrawal of cash from an account). This function iterates through the list of operations, accumulating a balance, and returns `True` if at any moment the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
