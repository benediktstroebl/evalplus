```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function iterates through the list of `operations`, summing them to a running balance. Whenever the balance dips into the negatives, the function promptly returns `True`, indicating that the balance went below zero at least once. If the balance never goes negative, the function returns `False` once it's gone through the entire list. 

This approach takes advantage of short-circuit evaluation, where the function can exit early if a condition is met, and is compliments by the `if balance < 0` clause which acts as a sentinel. 

This solution adheres to the `typing` framework to enhance code readability and maintainability, while effectively utilizing a simple loop and conditional to achieve the core functionality.
