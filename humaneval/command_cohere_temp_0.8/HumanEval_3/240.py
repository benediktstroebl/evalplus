```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. The function increments the `balance` variable with each operation in the input list. If at any point the `balance` becomes less than zero, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the operation list. 

Here is an example usage of the script:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
This example usage demonstrates the function's behavior, specifically:
- The first test case of `[1, 2, 3]` returns `False` since the balance never falls below zero.
- The second test case of `[1, 2, -4, 5]` returns `True` since the account balance falls below zero with the withdrawal of `-4`. 
This function solves the problem and passes the given tests. If you want to assign this code to the `below_zero` function in the larger context of the original Markdown code block, simply add the code below to the script:
```python
def bigger_than_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with 
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account exceeds zero, and 
    at that point function should return True. Otherwise it should return False.
    >>> bigger_than_zero([1, 2, 3])
    True
    >>> bigger_than_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
    False
    """
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance > 0:
            return True
    return False
``` 
This updates the function `bigger_than_zero` to exceed the zero balance on the account, instead of falling below it.
