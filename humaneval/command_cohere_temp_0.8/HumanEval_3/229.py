```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code tracks the balance as it processes each operation in the input list. If at any point the balance dips into the red, it returns True, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If not, it returns False. 

This approach is efficient and can handle multiple scenarios, making it a viable solution.
