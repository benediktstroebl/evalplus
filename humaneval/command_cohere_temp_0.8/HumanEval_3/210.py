```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the effects of these operations on a bank account starting with a balance of zero, updating the balance after each operation. It returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, indicating a deficit, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is an example usage of the function showing that it passes the given tests:
```python
>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
If you intend to use this function in a broader context, you may consider adding more comprehensive tests to cover various scenarios. Feel free to ask any follow-up questions or request further assistance on this or any other related topic.
