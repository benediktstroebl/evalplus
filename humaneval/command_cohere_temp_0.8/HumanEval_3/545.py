```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and checks whether any point the balance of operations will be below zero. This is done by simply summing up the operations in the list and checking if the sum is less than zero at any point. The function returns `True` if the balance goes below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

This would return `False` because the balance will never go below zero with the given list of operations. Whereas the second example will return `True` because at the third operation the balance will be `-2` which is less than zero.  This matches the expected behavior as stated in the example tests provided in the problem.
