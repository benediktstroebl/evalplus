```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function increments a variable `balance` with each operation, and checks if it crosses zero. The function returns `True` if the balance is less than zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. This matches the specified behavior in the comment, as it returns `True` for `[1, 2, -4, 5]` and `False` for `[1, 2, 3]`.
