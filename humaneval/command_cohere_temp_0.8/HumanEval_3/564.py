```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation representing a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money) on a bank account. The function calculates the net balance of the account by summing up the operations. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it returns `True`, indicating that the account's balance went negative at some point; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

This output is consistent with the provided example test cases. 

If the list of operations is `[1, 2, -4, 5]`, the balance will first be increased by 1 to 1, then by 2 to 3, and then decreased by 4 to -1. At this point, the balance is below zero, so the function returns `True`. 

If the list is `[1, 2, 3]`, the balance is never below zero, so the function returns `False`.  This matches the example test cases provided in your original prompt.  This function is designed to handle any list of operations and provides the correct result for any valid input.  It is robust and flexible enough to handle any permutation of deposits and withdrawals and is able to detect if the balance ever falls below zero at any point.
