```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It calculates the balance by summing up the operations, then determines if the balance falls below zero at any point. If the balance ever becomes negative, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
# Test the function with a list of operations
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Output: True
``` 

This test case validates the correct behavior of the function according to the problem statement.
