```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The function's purpose is to determine whether the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

The function starts by initializing the balance of the account to zero. Then, it iterates through each element in the `operations` list. For each operation, it adds the operation's value to the current balance. If the balance becomes negative at any point (meaning there is a net withdrawal amount greater than the initial balance), the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance ever falling below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account never had a negative balance during the sequence of operations.

This solution is straightforward and efficiently determines whether the account balance falls below zero at any point. It is a clear and concise implementation in Python, using standard Python types and idioms, making it easy to understand and maintain. And its logic closely matches the problem statement, making it a good practical solution for such a scenario. 

You can test this function with example operations to see if it correctly identifies situations where the account balance falls below zero:
```python
# Test Example
assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
``` 
This will verify the function's behavior against the provided test cases, ensuring it aligns with the expected outcomes.
