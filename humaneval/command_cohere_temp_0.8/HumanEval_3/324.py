```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation representing a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money) on a bank account. The function iterates through each operation, updating the balance by the operation value, and checks if the balance ever goes below zero. If it does, the function returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
# Test the function with a list of operations
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Output: True
``` 

This will return:
```
False
True
``` 

The first invocation of the function will return `False` because the balance will never go below zero, while in the second invocation, the balance will become negative after the third operation, so the function will return `True`.  This matches the test cases provided in the Problem Statement.  This approach does not require any additional modules and has a time complexity of `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements in the list of operations.  This is because it iterates through each element once, performing constant-time operations (`balance += op`).  It is the simplest possible approach for this problem.
