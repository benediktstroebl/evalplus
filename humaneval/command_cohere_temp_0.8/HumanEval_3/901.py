```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each value in the input list. It assumes that each integer represents a deposit or withdrawal operation, where positive values represent deposits, and negative values represent withdrawals. It keeps a running balance of these operations and checks if at any point the balance falls below zero. If it does, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the balance went negative at any point during the sequence of operations. If no negative balance is encountered, it returns `False`.

This solution follows the prompt's expected functionality, where it returns `True` for tests like `[1, 2, -4, 5]` and `False` for tests like `[1, 2, 3]`.
