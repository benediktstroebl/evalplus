```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). It iterates through each operation in the list, updating the balance by adding the value of the operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at some point. If no such instance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations. 

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem statement. It also follows Python's philosophy of "simple is better" by using a for loop to iterate over the operations and directly updating the balance variable.

Here's an example of how you can test this function using the Python `unittest` module:
```python
import unittest

def test_below_zero():
    # True case
    assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True

    # False case
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this test suite, we have two test cases: one that passes an example where the account balance goes below zero, and another that passes an example where the account balance remains non-negative throughout the operations. 

The `unittest.main()` call runs the tests when the script is executed directly. 

To run this test suite, simply run the script and the tests will be executed, providing you with clear feedback on whether your solution behaves as expected or not.
