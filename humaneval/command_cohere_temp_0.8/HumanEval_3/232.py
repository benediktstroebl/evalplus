```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and tests if any point the balance of operations result in a negative number. This is done using a simple loop that iterates through each operation, adding them to the balance variable. When a point is reached where the balance is less than 0, the function returns True, indicating that the balance went below zero at least once. If the loop completes without the balance dropping to zero, the function returns False. 

This solution works accordingly as the loop explicitly simulates the account balance operations and checks if at any moment the balance will be less than zero. 

This solution depends on Python 3.10 new typing module feature `List` and might not be compatible with previous versions.
