```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The function's purpose is to determine if the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

The function starts by initializing the balance of the account to zero. Then, it iterates through each element in the `operations` list. For each operation, it adds the operation's value to the current balance. If the balance becomes negative at any point (indicating a withdrawal exceeding the available balance), the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the balance fell below zero at least once. If the loop completes without the balance ever falling below zero, the function returns `False`, meaning the balance never fell below zero throughout the sequence of operations. 

This solution is straightforward and efficiently determines whether the balance goes negative at any point in the given operations, making it an optimal solution for this problem. 

The unit tests provided earlier verify the correct behavior of this function against various test cases, further ensuring its accuracy and robustness. This solution is efficient and does not require any additional libraries. It is framed as a simple cash ledger, where you add and subtract transactions, then check if you go negative at any moment.
