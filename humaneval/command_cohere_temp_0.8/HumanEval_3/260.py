```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point after applying the operations, and `False` otherwise.

The function starts by initializing the balance to zero and then iterates through each operation in the input list. It adds each operation to the current balance to simulate the effect of the operation on the account balance.

After applying each operation, it checks if the balance is less than zero. If it is, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that at some point the account balance fell below zero. If none of the operations cause the balance to go negative, it returns `False` at the end of the loop, meaning the account never fell into a negative balance.

This solution is efficient because it has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations in the input list. This is because it checks each operation only once and does not repeat any calculations.
