```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. It does so by iterating through each value in the input list and simulating the effect of each operation on the account balance.

The function starts by initializing a variable called `balance` to 0, which represents the initial balance of the account. It then iterates through each element `op` in the `operations` list. For each operation, the function adds the operation's value to the current balance. This simulates the effect of a deposit or withdrawal on the account balance. 

After processing all operations, the function returns `True` if the account balance ever fell below zero at any point during the simulation. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This elegantly simple solution is correct and efficiently determines whether the account balance falls below zero within the given set of operations. 

This function can be used to quickly and accurately determine whether any of the operations result in a negative balance, thus solving the problem statement. 

This approach has a time complexity of `O(n)` since it requires iterating through each operation only once. It is a linear function of the number of operations, making it efficient even for large inputs.
