```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation represents a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money) and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. 

The function iterates through each operation in the list, updating the balance as if each operation were executed. If at any point the balance falls below zero, the function returns `True`. If the balance doesn't fall below zero after processing all operations, it returns `False`. 

This solution follows the spirit of the **specification** provided in the prompt. 

If the logic somehow feels unclear, a closer-to-English explanation could go like this: "Given a list of financial operations, return true if at any moment the account balance (as a result of these operations) is negative, and false if it was never the case." 

This way, readers grasp the purpose of the function right away, even if they have little technical background.
