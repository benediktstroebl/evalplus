```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the effects of these operations on a balance and checks if it falls below zero at any point. If the balance ever goes negative, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`. This functionality is illustrated through examples in the docstring, as you provided.  This approach has a time complexity of `O(n)` since it iterates through each operation once, making it efficient for handling large lists of operations.
