```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the effects of these operations on a bank account starting with a balance of 0. It iterates through each operation in the input list and accumulates the total effect on the account balance. If at any point the balance falls below 0, it indicates that the account balance became negative at some point, and the function returns `True`. If the account balance remains non-negative after processing all operations, it returns `False`. 

This solution relies on the state of the balance variable to keep track of the current balance of the account, updating it with each operation. Thus, it follows a straightforward iterative approach that is both accurate and efficient. 

This approach is efficient because it uses a for loop to iterate over the operations list only once, computing the balance after each operation. Thus, it has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the operations list.
