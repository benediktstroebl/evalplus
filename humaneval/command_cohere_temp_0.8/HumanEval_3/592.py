```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `List[int]` and calculates the balance of the bank account after each operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The script passes the tests provided in the prompt:
```
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False

>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
This code is deterministic and easily understandable by fellow programmers. However, the execution time is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of operations, it would benefit from optimization for larger deposit and withdrawal lists.
