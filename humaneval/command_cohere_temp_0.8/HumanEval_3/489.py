```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It calculates the balance by summing the operations, then checks if it goes negative at any point, in which case it returns `True`, or if it remains non-negative, in which case it returns `False`. 

Here is an example usage output:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

This function adheres to the problem statement and provides an efficient solution. It can handle any list of operations and will correctly determine if the balance falls below zero at any point.
