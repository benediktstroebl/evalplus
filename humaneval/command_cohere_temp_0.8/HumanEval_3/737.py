```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and determines whether the balance of a bank account, which starts at zero balance, falls below zero at any point during the specified operations.

The function iterates through each operation in the input list. For each operation, it updates the current balance by adding the effect of the operation. If the balance falls below zero at any point, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the balance went negative at any time. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account's balance never fell below zero during the given operations. 

This solution is efficient and directly iterates through the input list, making it suitable for handling lists of different sizes without adding additional complexity.
