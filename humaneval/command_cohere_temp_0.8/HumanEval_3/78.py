```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function iterates through each operation in the list, simulating the effect of each operation on the account balance. It keeps track of the balance as it processes each operation. 

If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once during the sequence of operations. If the entire list of operations is processed without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero. 

The function is designed to handle any list of operations, including empty lists, and it provides the correct outcome for the given problem in an efficient manner. 

This solution is testable and extensible, allowing for proper validation of various scenarios and accommodating potential future changes in requirements.
