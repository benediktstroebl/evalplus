```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations, iterates through them, updates the balance, and checks if it's negative at any point. It returns True if the balance falls below zero anytime during the operations, otherwise, it returns False. 

This solution follows the given test examples provided in the markdown code block and should correctly solve the problem.
