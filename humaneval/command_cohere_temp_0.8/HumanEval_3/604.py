```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. The function increments the `balance` parameter with each operation in the list, and checks if it is less than zero. If it is, the function returns `True`. If the balance is zero at the end of the loop, the function returns `False`.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This example mimics the examples given in the original problem description. The first example passed the function `below_zero` a list of operations `[1, 2, 3]`, which represents a series of deposits to the account. Since the balance never falls below zero, the function returns `False`. The second example passes the function a list of operations `[1, 2, -4, 5]`. Because the account balance falls below zero with the operation `-4` and then returns to zero with the operation `5`, the function returns `True`. 

This script successfully passes both test cases outlined in the original problem description.
