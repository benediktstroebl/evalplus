```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `List[int]` and calculates the descending balance of the bank account. It iterates through each operation (both deposit and withdrawal) and accumulates them to the balance. Once the balance is below zero, it returns `True`. If the end of the operation is reached with a non-negative balance, it returns `False`. 

This solution follows the instruction and returns the correct value for the corresponding test cases mentioned in the prompt.
