```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and checks whether any point the balance of operations result in a value less than 0. The function iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates the balance of operations. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`. 

This solution follows the specification of the problem and uses Python's strong typing with the `typing` module and `List` annotation.
