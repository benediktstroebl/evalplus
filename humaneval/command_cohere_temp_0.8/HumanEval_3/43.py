```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and determines whether the balance of a bank account, initially set to zero, falls below zero after executing all the operations. The function iterates through each operation in the input list, updating the current balance by adding the effect of each operation. If at any point the balance becomes negative, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at some point. If all operations are executed without causing a negative balance, it returns `False`. This function effectively solves the problem statement and can be used to determine whether the balance of a bank account subjected to the given operations will ever be negative.
