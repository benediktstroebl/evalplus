```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and checks whether any point the balance of operations will be below zero. This is done by simply summing up the operations in the list and checking if the sum ever becomes negative. The function returns `True` if the balance goes below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

As expected, the function returns `False` for the first example list, as the sum of the operations is equal to `3`, which is greater than zero. For the second example, the function returns `True` since the sum of the operations is equal to `-2`, which is less than zero. 

This correctly solves the problem and would pass any corresponding tests.
