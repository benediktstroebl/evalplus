```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function iterates through the list of `operations`, summing them to the `balance`. If the `balance` falls below zero at any point, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop if the `balance` remains non-negative. 

This approach assumes that each element in the list represents either a deposit (positive integer) or a withdrawal (negative integer) operation on the bank account. 

The function is designed to efficiently handle the given problem and provide the correct output based on the provided input. 

You can test this function by calling it with different lists of operations and verifying the output against the expected results.
