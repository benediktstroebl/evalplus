```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates them into a variable called `balance`. If at any point the `balance` falls below zero, it indicates that the account balance went negative at some point, and the function returns `True`. If the balance remains non-negative at the end of iteration, it returns `False`, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero. 

This solution adheres to the given test cases and provides the correct result for the specified scenario. 
```python
def test_below_zero():
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
    assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
    assert below_zero([0, 0, 0]) == False
``` 
The test case covers multiple scenarios and asserts the function's behavior as expected.
