```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script introduces a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operation` values and returns `True` if the balance of operations falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise.

To solve the problem, the function simply accumulates the effect of operations on a hypothetical bank account by summing up the operations in the given list. It then returns `True` if the balance ever falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. 

This approach leverages the simplicity of maintaining a running balance and directly checks for the condition of interest, avoiding any complexities like `memoization` or `dynamic programming`. 

The unit tests for this function can be as simple as requesting its behavior on predefined inputs, some of which include:
```python
# Test cases for the below_zero function
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False

>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True

>>> below_zero([0, 5, -10, 15, -20, 25])
True

>>> below_zero([-5, -10, -15, -20])
True

>>> below_zero([0, 0, 0, 0])
False
``` 
This approach showcases the beautiful simplicity of the `below_zero` function and its direct interpretation of the problem statement. 

However, it may not be suited for dealing with massive lists of operations as it traverses the list fully for each computation.
