```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (of type `List[int]`), which represent the deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. The function initializes the balance to 0 and then iterates through each operation in the list. It accumulates the balance as it would in a real-world scenario. If at any point the balance falls below 0, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at some point during the operations. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, it returns `False`.

This solution efficiently solves the problem without any unnecessary complexity and provides the correct output for the given test cases.
