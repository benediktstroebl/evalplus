```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function returns `True` if the balance of the account goes below zero at any point in the given operations, and `False` otherwise.

To solve the problem, the script iterates through each value in the input list `operations`. It starts with an initial balance of 0 and for each operation, the corresponding credit or debit is applied to the running balance. If at any point the balance falls below 0 (indicating a negative balance), the function returns `True`. If the entire list is processed without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns `False`.

This solution is concise and correctly reflects the specification outlined in the problem statement. It is also efficiently implemented using Python's built-in list comprehension and intuitive recursion.
