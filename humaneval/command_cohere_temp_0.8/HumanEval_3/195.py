```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers `operations` as input. It simulates the operations done on a bank account, starting with a balance of 0. It iterates through each element in the input list, representing deposit and withdrawal operations, and updates the current balance by adding the `op`. If at any point the balance falls below 0 (indicating a negative balance), it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account's balance fell below zero at least once. If all operations result in a non-negative balance, it returns `False` at the end. 

This solution is efficient, with a time complexity of O(n), where 'n' is the number of operations given. 

The script also demonstrates the use of the function with examples, asserting that `below_zero([1, 2, 3])` returns `False` and `below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])` returns `True`.  This helps to ensure the function behaves as expected and is a good practice to include in code solutions.
