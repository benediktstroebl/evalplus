```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (of type `List[int]`), which represent the sequence of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. The function simulates the behavior of the account by iterating through each operation in the list and updating the balance accordingly.

The function returns `True` immediately once it detects that the balance has fallen below zero at any point during the iteration, indicating that the account balance went negative at least once. If the balance never falls below zero after applying all operations, it returns `False`.

This solution is concise and directly iterates through the operations, making it efficient for longer operation lists as well.
