```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point due to those operations, and `False` otherwise. It achieves this by iterating through each operation in the input list and accumulating their effect on the balance. If at any point the balance slips into the negative, it immediately returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero.  This solution assumes that the input list contains either only positive numbers (deposits) or a combination of positive and negative numbers (withdrawals and deposits). 
```python
test_cases = [
    ([1, 2, 3], False),
    ([1, 2, -4, 5], True),
    ([-100, -10, -1, -1, 1, 2, 3, -4, 5], True),
    ([2, -3, 4, -1, 2, -5], True),
]

for ops, expected in test_cases:
    actual = below_zero(ops)
    assert actual == expected, f"For input {ops}, expected {expected} but got {actual}"
``` 

The test cases cover various scenarios to validate the function against expected outputs.
