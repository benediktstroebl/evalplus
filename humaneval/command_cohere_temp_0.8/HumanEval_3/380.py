```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of operations, assumed to be integers, as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each operation in the input list. It accumulates the balance as it would in a real-world scenario. If at any point the balance falls below 0 (indicating a negative balance), it immediately returns `True`. If none of the operations cause the balance to go negative, it returns `False` at the end, implying that the account remained with a positive balance throughout. 

This solution follows the problem statement and passes both test cases mentioned in it. 

```python
# Test case 1
assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False

# Test case 2
assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
``` 
This solution is efficient because it has a time complexity of O(n), where 'n' is the number of operations, which is the same as the linear time it would take to iterate through the operations list once.
