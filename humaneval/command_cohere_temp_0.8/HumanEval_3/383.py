```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. The function initializes a variable `balance` to 0, which represents the balance of the bank account. It then iterates through each element `op` in the input list of operations.

For each operation, it adds the operation's value to the current balance. If the new balance becomes less than zero, it indicates that the account balance fell below zero at some point, so the function returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account never fell into a negative balance during the given operations. 

This solution is concise and directly iterates through the operations to calculate the account balance, checking at each step if it dips below zero.
