```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates them into a running balance using an initial balance of 0. It returns `True` if the balance ever falls below 0 during this iteration, indicating that the account balance went negative at some point. If the balance never falls below 0, it returns `False`. This function detects if the balance of the account ever falls below zero during the sequence of deposits and withdrawals. 
The function is designed to handle any list of operations and does not rely on any external variables or assumptions beyond the input list. It can be used to analyze different scenarios of deposits and withdrawals and determine whether the balance ever falls below zero. 
This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations in the input list. It completes in linear time, processing each operation once to compute the resulting account balance. 
The code is concise and clear, expressing the problem's essence directly in Python without resorting to higher-order complexities or recursive schemes, making it computationally efficient and inherently debug-friendly.  comfortable handling codebases. 
If needed, this can be complimented with a comprehensive test suite to validate accurate functionality across diverse scenarios and edge cases, reassuring trust in the algorithm's correctness.  Any such tests would constitute a robust framework to ensure long-term maintainability of the codebase and ease future modifications, optimizations, or expansions, above and beyond mere correctness.
