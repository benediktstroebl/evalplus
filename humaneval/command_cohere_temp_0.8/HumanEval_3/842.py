```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `List[int]` and calculates the balance of the bank account after each operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function achieves this by iterating through each operation in the input list and updating the balance accordingly. 

Here is an example usage of the code:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This example mirrors the usage provided in the problem statement. The first example fails to bring the balance below zero, hence `below_zero` returns `False`. In the second example, however, the account balance dips into the red with -1 after the second operation, so `below_zero` returns `True`.  This aligns with the expected behavior as defined in the problem statement.
