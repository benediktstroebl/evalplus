```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function iterates through the list of operations, updating the balance as if it were a bank account. If at any point the `balance` goes negative, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This example mirrors the usage provided in the problem statement. The first example fails since the balance never goes below zero, whereas in the second example the balance goes from $1 to $-2 to $3, so the function returns `True`.
