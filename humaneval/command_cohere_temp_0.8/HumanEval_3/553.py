```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` and returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point during the operations, and `False` otherwise. It achieves this by iterating through each operation in the list and updating the current balance accordingly. Once it detects that the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If the entire list is processed without the balance dropping to zero, it returns `False`. This behavior is illustrated in the docstring's examples, where it correctly identifies True and False for various input operation lists. 

This approach ensures that the function can be used to analyze different sequences of operations and provide a clear result regarding the account's balance status.
