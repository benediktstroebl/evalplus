```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The `below_zero` function iterates through the list of `operations` and simulates the effect of each operation on the account balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`. This algorithm has a time complexity of `O(n)` since it checks each operation in the list once. 

This solution is straightforward and effective, suitable for problems like this one that involve maintaining an aggregate value based on operations. 

This solution assumes that the input list only contains integers representing deposit and withdrawal operations.
