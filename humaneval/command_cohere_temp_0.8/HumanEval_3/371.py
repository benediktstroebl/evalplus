```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the effects of these operations on a bank account starting with a balance of 0. It iterates through each operation in the input list and updates the balance accordingly. If at any point the balance falls below 0 (indicating a negative balance), it immediately returns `True`. If no such negative balance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end. 

This solution has an efficiency of `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input list `operations`, as it checks each operation in a single pass. 

This approach offers a straightforward way to determine if the balance drops below zero during any point in the sequence of operations, without requiring preprocessing or extra memory usage.
