```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. It does so by iterating through each value in the input list and simulating the effect of each operation on the account balance.

The function starts by initializing a variable named `balance` to 0, which represents the initial balance of the account. Then, it iterates through each element `op` in the `operations` list. For each operation, it adds the operation's value to the current balance. After each addition, it checks if the updated balance is less than 0. If this is the case, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at some point during the operations, even if it rises back to zero or into a positive range afterward. If no such instance is found, it returns `False` at the end of the loop, suggesting that the account balance never fell below zero. 

Here is an example of the code in action:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This exemplifies the function's behavior, highlighting that it correctly identifies account balance falling below zero with the second test case. 

This problem can also be solved with a single pass through the operation list, without the need for an explicit loop structure. Here's a more concise solution:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance, is_negative = 0, 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        is_negative |= balance < 0
    return is_negative != 0
```
This variation employs the bitwise OR operator `|=` to toggle the `is_negative` variable on and off as needed, resulting in a more condensed expression of the problem's constraints. 

To achieve the same effect without bitwise operators, you can alternatively use the `update()` method on a dictionary to simultaneously update the balance and check if it's negative: 
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    account = {
        'balance': balance,
        'is_negative': False
    }
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        account['balance'] += op
        if account['balance'] < 0:
            account['is_negative'] = True
    return account['is_negative']
```
