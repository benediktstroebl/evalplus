```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It iterates through each operation in the input list, accumulating a balance as if it were a bank account. When an operation causes the balance to go negative, the function immediately returns `True`. If no negative balance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations. This function provides a straightforward solution to the problem by checking the conditions at each step of the operations.
