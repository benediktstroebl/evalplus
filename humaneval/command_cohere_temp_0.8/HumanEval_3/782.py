```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the actions of these operations on a bank account balance and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It iterates through each operation in the input list, adding the operation's value to the current balance. If the balance ever becomes negative, it immediately returns `True`. If the end of the list is reached without the balance ever falling below zero, it returns `False`. 

Here is an example usage of this code:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This would return `False` for the first example because the balance never falls below zero, and `True` for the second example because the final balance is -2, which is below zero.
