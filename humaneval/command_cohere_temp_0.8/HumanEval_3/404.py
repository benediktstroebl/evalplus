```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). The function iterates through each operation in the list, updating the balance by adding the operation's value. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If no such instance is found, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations. 

This solution is concise and efficiently determines if the account balance goes below zero at any point during the given operations. 
Let's break down the code:
- The library import `from typing import List` declares that the function `below_zero` accepts a list of integers as its input.
- The variable `balance = 0` is initialized to track the current balance of the bank account.
- The function `below_zero` iterates through each element in `operations` using a `for` loop.
- For each operation, it adds the operation's value to the `balance`.
- If at any point the `balance` becomes less than zero (`if balance < 0`), it immediately returns `True`, as it has detected that the account balance fell below zero at least once.
- If it completes the loop without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`, meaning the account never fell into a negative balance during the given operations. 
This solution has a time complexity of `O(n)` since it iterates through each operation once, resulting in an efficient solution to the problem. A usage example is:
```python
>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
>> below_zero([6, 4, 1, 7, 2, -3])
False
``` 

Finally, note that the `below_zero` function is straightforward to use and doesn't require additional dependencies beyond the Python standard library.  While this solution is efficient and straightforward, it suffers from one drawback, namely that it doesn't provide any information about the operations that led to the negative balance. If you require more detailed information, you'll need to modify the approach to keep track of such details, which might increase the complexity of the solution.
