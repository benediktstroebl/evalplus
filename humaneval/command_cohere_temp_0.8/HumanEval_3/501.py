```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. The function iterates through each value in the input list and accumulates the balance of the bank account. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it indicates a negative balance, and the function returns `True`. If the balance remains non-negative throughout, it returns `False`.

Here's an example of how you can use the `below_zero` function with two test cases, which should both return `False` and `True` respectively:
```python
# Test case 1:
assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False

# Test case 2:
assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
``` 
This demonstrates that the `below_zero` function correctly identifies situations where the account balance falls below zero. Feel free to customize this code block further as needed for your specific requirements.
