```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates them into a running balance. If the balance drops to a negative value at any point, it immediately returns `True`. If no such drop occurs, it returns `False` once all operations are processed. 

Here is an example usage output:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

This matches the specified behavior in the problem statement.
