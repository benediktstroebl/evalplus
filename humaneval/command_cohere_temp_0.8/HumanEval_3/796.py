```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. It does so by iterating through each value in the input list and simulating the effect of each operation on the account balance.

The function starts by initializing a variable named `balance` to 0, which represents the initial balance of the account. Then, it iterates through each element `op` in the `operations` list. For each operation, it adds the operation's value to the current balance. This simulates the effect of a deposit or withdrawal on the account balance.

During this process, if the `balance` falls below zero at any point (meaning the account has a negative balance after an operation), the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account's balance never fell below zero during the sequence of operations. 

This function utilizes Python's typing module, which is used to infer the types of variables to enable type checking. This helps catch potential errors before runtime, making the code more robust and reliable.

The function is designed to return `False` if the account's balance never falls below zero, and `True` if it does. This functionality is demonstrated in the docstring's explanatory examples, where the function is applied to two example lists of operations. These examples show how the function would handle these operations and return the appropriate boolean values based on the conditions.
