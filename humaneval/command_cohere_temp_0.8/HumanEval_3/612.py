```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each operation in the list. It adds each operation to the current balance and checks if the balance becomes negative at any point. If it does, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

This example usage passes the specified tests.
