```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (representing deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account) and returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise.

The function iterates through each operation in the input list. It updates the balance by adding the effect of each operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, it returns `False`.

This solution is efficient, with a time complexity of `O(n)` where `n` is the number of operations, as it performs a single pass through the operations list.
