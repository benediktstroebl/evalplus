```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code tracks the balance as it processes each operation in the input list. If at any point the balance dips into the negative, the function promptly returns True, indicating that the account balance went below zero. If not, it returns False. 

This solution adheres to Python's type hinting and includes a docstring, providing a clear explanation of the function's purpose and usage. Additionally, the function is designed to gracefully handle empty input lists, avoiding any potential errors.
