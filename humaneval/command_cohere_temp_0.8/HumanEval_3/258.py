```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and accumulates them into a running balance using an `assignment expression`. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If the entire list is processed and the balance remains non-negative, it returns `False`. This function detects if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point based on the given operations. 

Here is an example usage of the code:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

This test cases validate the correct operation of the `below_zero` function.
