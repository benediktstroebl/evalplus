```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It calculates the balance by summing the operations, then checks if it goes negative at any point, in which case it returns `True`, or if it remains non-negative, in which case it returns `False`. The behavior is demonstrated through example in the function docstring, as per the prompt instructions.  This approach has a time complexity of `O(n)` since it iterates through each operation once, making it efficient for handling large lists of operations.
