```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). The function simulates the progression of the account's balance after each operation and checks if it falls below zero at any point. If the balance ever goes negative, it returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This solution makes use of Python's strong typing and the `List[int]` annotation to ensure that the input is a list of integers, simulating the withdrawal and deposit operations on a bank account. 

This approach has a time complexity of `O(n)` since it iterates through each element in the list once, resulting in efficient performance for medium-sized input lengths. 

To pass tests, you can create a `test.py` file and write test cases, or use the following examples:
```python
def test_below_zero():
    # True case
    assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True

    # False case
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False

    # Edge case: No operations
    assert below_zero([]) == False
``` 
You can then run the tests using the command `python test.py` or by pressing the play button in your IDE if it supports it.  This way, you can verify that the function behaves correctly for different scenarios.  If you are interested in more advanced testing techniques, we can discuss test setup and the usage of frameworks like `pytest`.
