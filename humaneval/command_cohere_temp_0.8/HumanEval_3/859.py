```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. It does so by iterating through each value in the input list and simulating the effect of each operation on the account balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns `False`. 

This solution is encapsulated and doesn't require any external dependencies. It provides a clear indication of whether the account balance can go negative after applying the sequence of operations. Careful attention to edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with only deposits or withdrawals, ensures the function handles these scenarios correctly. This is demonstrated in the example below:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
>>> below_zero([-10, 5, -3, 7, -2])
True
>>> below_zero([])
False
``` 
This demonstrates that the function correctly identifies situations where the account balance falls below zero and provides a consistent truthy/falsey response.  This solution exemplifies good coding practices with efficient code that is easy to understand and maintains a focus on simplicity and correctness, rather than optimization.  If there is a need for further optimization, it can be considered based on specific constraints or performance requirements, but at the moment, it's well-balanced between code clarity and efficiency.
