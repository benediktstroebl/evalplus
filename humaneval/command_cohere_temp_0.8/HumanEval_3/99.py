```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of operations, presumably deposits and withdrawals, on a bank account. The function initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each operation in the list. It accumulates the balance as if each operation were done sequentially in real life. If at any point the balance goes below 0, the function returns True, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at least once. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, it returns False. 

This solution is efficient because it uses only a single pass through the operation list, with a space complexity of `O(1)`, or linear time complexity `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the input list. This is the optimal efficiency for this particular problem.
