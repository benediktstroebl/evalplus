```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function iterates through each operation in the list, simulating the effect of each operation on the account balance. It keeps track of the balance as it processes each operation. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at some point during the operations. If the entire list of operations is processed without the balance dropping below zero, it returns `False`.

This solution follows the problem statement and provides an efficient way to determine if the account balance goes below zero during the given operations. It can be tested with the provided examples, with the result being `True` for the second example and `False` for the first one, as expected.
