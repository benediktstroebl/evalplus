```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). The function simulates the effects of these operations on a bank account's balance and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. It iterates through each operation in the input list, adding the operation value to the current balance. If the balance drops to or below zero at any point, it immediately returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of processing all operations if the balance remained positive throughout.  This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where 'n' is the number of elements in the input list of operations.  This linear time complexity arises from iterating through each operation once.  This subtle and clever approach enables it to handle any valid input scenario gracefully without requiring additional constraints on the input size.
