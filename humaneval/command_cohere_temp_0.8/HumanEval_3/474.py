```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The script introduces an additional variable, called `balance`, which helps to keep track of the current balance. The function updates the variable with every operation and checks if the balance falls below zero at any point. If such a situation is detected, the function immediately returns `True`. If no such situation is detected, the function returns `False` at the end of the operations list. 

This approach ensures that the function immediately returns once the desired condition is met, enhancing the efficiency of the code and maintaining a concise and clear structure.  This makes the code more reliable and easier to understand at the same time.
