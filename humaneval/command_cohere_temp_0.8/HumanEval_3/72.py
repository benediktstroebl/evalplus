```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation representing a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money) on a bank account. The function keeps a running balance as it iterates through these operations, and it returns `True` if the balance ever falls below zero at any point, indicating some sort of error or overdraft situation. If the balance never falls below zero, it returns `False`.

This correctly detects the scenario described in the prompt, namely that the function returns `True` for the input `[1, 2, -4, 5]` and `False` for the input `[1, 2, 3]`.
