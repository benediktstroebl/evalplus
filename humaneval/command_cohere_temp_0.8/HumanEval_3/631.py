```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or withdrawal). It calculates the balance by summing the operations, then determines if the balance falls below zero at any point in the operations. If the balance ever becomes negative, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This example upholds the function's behavior as described in the problem statement. The first example should return `False` since the balance is never negative. The second example returns `True` because the account balance becomes negative after the operation `-4`, and stays negative after the subsequent operation `5`.
