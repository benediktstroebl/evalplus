```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each value in the input list. It assumes that each integer represents a deposit or withdrawal operation, where positive values represent deposits, and negative values represent withdrawals. It keeps a running balance of these operations and returns `True` if the balance ever falls below zero at any point in the sequence, indicating that the account balance became negative. If the balance never falls below zero, it returns `False`.

Here is an example usage of this function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```
This demonstrates that the function correctly identifies situations where the account balance falls below zero.
