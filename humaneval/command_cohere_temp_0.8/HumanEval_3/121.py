```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and determines whether the balance of a bank account, initialized at zero, would fall below zero after executing all the operations. It iterates through each operation in the input list, summing them to the current balance. If at any point the calculated balance becomes negative, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance falls below zero at some point. If all operations are non-negative, it returns `False` as the ending balance is zero. 

This solution is efficient, implementing a linear time complexity (`O(n)`), since it checks each operation sequentially and requires no additional memory beyond that which is required to store the input list. It provides a straightforward answer to the problem statement's requirement.  This approach is elegant, concise, and effective in solving the problem statement.
