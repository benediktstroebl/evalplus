```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function simulates the operations on a bank account starting with a zero balance, and returns `True` if the account balance falls below zero at any point due to the given operations. The tests provided in the problem statement are included here to demonstrate the function's behavior:
```python
def test_below_zero():
    # No negative balance, should return False
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False

    # An negative balance, should return True
    assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True

    # A balance that becomes negative due to a series of deposits and withdrawals, should return True
    assert below_zero([4, -7, 3, -2, 1, -5, 6, -3]) == True

test_below_zero()
``` 
The test code provided verifies the function's behavior against the problem statement's examples.
