```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of `operations` as input, where each element represents an operation on a bank account (either a deposit or a withdrawal). The function simulates the effect of these operations on a bank account starting with a balance of zero, updating the balance after each operation. It returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, indicating a deficit, and `False` otherwise. This is achieved using a simple loop that iterates through the operations, updating the balance and returning `True` immediately if a deficit is detected. 

The unit tests displayed in the initial request return `False` for a list of deposit operations `[1, 2, 3]`, and return `True` for a list of operations `[1, 2, -4, 5]` that includes a withdrawal operation (-4) that causes the balance to go into deficit.  This test coverage ensures that the function behaves as expected for different scenarios.  This solution is concise and direct, representing a fundamental step in solving this type of problem by using looping constructs to iterate over sequences of numbers.  This approach can be easily adapted to address a variety of similar problems in automation of banking processes that entail processing sequences of monetary operations.
