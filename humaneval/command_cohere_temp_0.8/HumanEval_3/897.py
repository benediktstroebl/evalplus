```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an integer value that can either be a deposit (positive) or a withdrawal (negative) to the account. The function monitors the balance of the account and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, indicating that there was a negative balance at some point. If the balance never falls below zero, it returns `False`.

The function starts by initializing the balance to zero and then iterates through each element in the `operations` list. It updates the balance by adding the effect of each operation (deposit or withdrawal) to the current balance. If at any point the balance becomes negative (falling below zero), the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at some point during the sequence of operations. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, it returns `False`.

This solution follows the specifications of the problem and provides a clear and direct implementation of the account balance simulation and below-zero detection. It can be used to detect if any point the balance of the account falls below zero. 

This code can be tested against the test cases provided in the problem statement, such as `[]` and `[1, 2, -4, 5]`, to verify its correctness.  This approach provides a clear way to simulate the account balance and makes it easy to determine if it falls below zero at any point.
