```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and determines whether the balance of a bank account, initialized at zero, would fall below zero at any point during the sequence of operations. The function iterates through each operation in the input list, accumulating the effect of these operations on the account balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went negative at some point. If the entire sequence results in a non-negative balance, it returns `False`. 

This solution is efficient since it has a time complexity of O(n), where 'n' is the number of operations, making it suitable for handling large datasets.
