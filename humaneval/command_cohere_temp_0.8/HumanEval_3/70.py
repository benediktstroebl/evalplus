```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, where each element in the `operations` list represents an operation on the account, such as a deposit or withdrawal. The goal is to determine if the balance of the account ever falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.

To achieve this, the function iterates through each operation in the input list. It starts with an initial balance of 0 and for each operation, it adds the value of the operation to the current balance. This simulates the effect of the operation on the account balance.

If at any point the calculated `balance` becomes less than 0, it means the account balance has fallen below zero, and the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that the bad scenario has occurred. If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, the function returns `False`, meaning the account never fell into negative territory during the given sequence of operations.

The function returns either `True` or `False`, depending on whether the account balance dips beneath zero at any moment during the sequence of operations. This functionality enables you to ascertain whether the account balance deviates negatively at any given point in time.
