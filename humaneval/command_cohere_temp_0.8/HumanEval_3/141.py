```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and then iterates through each value in the input list. It adds each operation to the current balance and checks if it falls below 0. If the balance is ever negative, it immediately returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` after processing all operations if the balance remained non-negative. 

Here's an example usage illustration:
```python
# Example usage
assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
``` 
This demonstrates the function's behavior for the provided test cases, returning `False` for a positive balance and `True` for a negative balance at the end of the operation list.
