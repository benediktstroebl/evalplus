```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations, presumably deposits and withdrawals, on a bank account. It iterates through each operation in the list, accumulating the balance of the account. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went negative at some point. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, it returns `False`. 

This solution is concise and correctly solves the problem based on the prompt's instructions. It's also easily understandable and does not require any external dependencies or assumptions beyond those stated in the problem. 

This code can be tested against the provided examples in the prompt, and it will respectively return `False` for the first case and `True` for the second case.
