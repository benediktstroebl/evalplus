```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. The function monitors the balance of operations and returns `True` if the balance falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. It uses a for loop to iterate through each integer in the list of operations, adding each value to the running total `balance`. If at any point the balance is less than 0, it returns True, and it returns False after processing all operations if the balance has remained or exceeded zero.  This approach is efficient in terms of time and space, and it handles all test cases correctly.
