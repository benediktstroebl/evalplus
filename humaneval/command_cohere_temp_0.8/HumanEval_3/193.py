```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through each value in the input list. It assumes that each integer represents a deposit or withdrawal operation, where positive values represent deposits, and negative values represent withdrawals. It keeps a running balance of these operations and returns `True` if the balance ever falls below zero at any point in the sequence, indicating that the account went into a negative balance. If the balance never falls below zero, it returns `False`.

This solution follows the prompt's expected behavior, returning `True` for tests like `[1, 2, -4, 5]` and `[1, 2, 3]`, respectively. 
It is important to note that this assumes that each element in the list represents a single transaction that happens at a specific point in time, and it gives the exact result as requested in the problem statement. If there are other constraints or complexities involved, the solution might change accordingly.
