```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code tracks the balance as it processes each operation in the list. If the balance ever drops below 0, it returns True, which signifies an issue with the account. If not, it returns False. 

This solution follows Python's efficient coding style and leverages the powerful type system of Python to ensure robust handling of the data.
