```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes in a list of integers `operations` as input. The function calculates the balance of the bank account by summing the `operations` and checks if the balance ever falls below zero, and returns `True` if it does, else `False`. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
``` 
The first call to the function will return `False` because the balance will never go below zero. The second example will return `True` because the account balance will be negative after the third operation. 

This script successfully solves the problem and passes the tests outlined in the problem statement.
