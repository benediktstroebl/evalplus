```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to simulate the operations performed on a bank account, such as deposits and withdrawals, and determine whether the account balance falls below zero at any point.

Here's how the script works:
1. The function begins by initializing a variable called `balance` with a value of 0. This variable represents the current balance of the bank account.
2. The function then iterates through each element (`op`) in the input list of operations.
3. During each iteration, the current `balance` is updated by adding the effect of the respective operation (`op`). If the operation is a deposit, it adds to the balance; if it's a withdrawal, it subtracts from the balance.
4. After each operation, the function checks if the updated balance is less than 0. If it is, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at that point.
5. If the loop completes without the account balance ever falling below zero, the function returns `False`, indicating that the account balance stayed above or equal to zero throughout the operations.

The script includes a docstring with example tests to demonstrate the behavior of the `below_zero` function. These examples show that the function correctly identifies scenarios where the account balance falls below zero and returns `True`, as well as scenarios where the balance remains non-negative and returns `False`.
