```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes in a list of `operations` (each operation represents a deposit or withdrawal of a certain amount of money). The function initializes a variable `balance` to 0, and iterates through each operation in the input list. It accumulates the sum of the operations, and if at any point the `balance` falls below 0, it immediately returns `True`. If no such negative balance is encountered, it returns `False` at the end. 

This solution adheres to the explicit instructions in the prompt regarding the return value of the function based on the given input lists of operations. 

This approach is linear in the number of operations, but it is simple and straightforward, which makes it easy to understand and maintain, especially for small problem sizes.  If you wish to optimize for larger inputs, you may want to consider alternative approaches such as memoization.
