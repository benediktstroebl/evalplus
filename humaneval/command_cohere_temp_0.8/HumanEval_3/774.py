```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input. This function is designed to determine whether the balance of an account, which starts at $0, can fall below zero after executing a series of deposit and withdrawal operations represented by the `operations` list.

The function iterates through each value in the `operations` list, adding each operation (deposit or withdrawal) to the current balance. If at any point the calculated `balance` falls below zero, it implies there is a negative balance, and the function returns `True`. If the balance remains non-negative throughout all operations, the function returns `False`, indicating that the balance never fell below zero. 

This solution is efficient, implementing a linear time complexity (`O(n)`), where `n` is the number of operations given. 

The function does not assume any specific order of operations in the input list, and it is designed to work correctly regardless of the order in which the operations are applied. This makes the function resilient to variations in operation lists.
