```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations `List[int]` as an argument. It iterates through each operation in the list and simulates the effect of that operation on a bank account balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least once. If the balance never falls below zero after processing all operations, it returns `False`. 

This solution is concise and correctly matches the problem statement. Also, it's worth noting that the code assumes that the list of operations is valid, i.e., each item in the list is either a deposit (positive integer) or a withdrawal (negative integer) operation. 

This solution assumes no exceptions or edge cases, as it literally follows the problem's assumptions. However, please note that in a real-world scenario, you would need to consider potential errors, such as handling an empty list or non-integer values, to ensure more robust software.  If you have specific requirements or additional potential edge cases, please clarify so that I can adjust my response accordingly.
