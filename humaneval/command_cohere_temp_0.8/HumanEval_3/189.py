```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integer operations and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a for loop to iterate through the list of operations, updating the balance as if each operation were executed. If at any point the balance is less than zero, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` at the end of the loop if the list of operations is executed without involving a negative balance.  This solution is efficient since it uses only a single pass through the operation list and has a time complexity of O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the list.
