The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` takes a single argument `s` and returns `True` if the last character of the string `s` is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word (i.e., if it's an isolated character and not part of a word), and `False` otherwise.

The function's logic can be broken down into the following steps:
1. The length of the string `s` is reduced by 1 (`str_len = len(txt) - 1`) to prepare for the extraction of the last character.
2. The last character of the string `s` is stored in the variable `last_char` (`last_char = txt[-1]`).
3. An empty string check is conducted by evaluating `if str_len == -1:` and, if true, the function returns False as an empty string contains no characters.
4. The string `s` is split into individual words using spaces as delimiters (`words = txt.split()`).
5. The variable `index` is used to iterate through the words in reverse order, reducing the index by 1 to exclude the last character that has already been captured in the `words` list.
6. Using the `index`, the function checks if the last character in the original string `s` is equal to the character at the ith position in the `words` list. If an equal character is found, the function returns False.
7. If none of the conditions for returning False are met, the function returns True. 

The tests confirmed that the function behaves as expected and provides the following outputs:
```
True
True
False
False
```
