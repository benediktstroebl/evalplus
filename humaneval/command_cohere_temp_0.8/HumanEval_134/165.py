    # Define a whitelist of punctuation that is allowed to separate letters from words
    ALLOWED_PUNCTUATION = set(['.', '!', '?', '(', ')', '[', ']', '{', '}', '\\n'])

    # Check if the string is empty
    if not txt:
        return False

    # Split the string into words and get the last character
    words = txt.split()
    last_char = words[-1][-1] if len(words[-1]) > 0 else ''

    # Check if the last character is a letter and is not preceded by allowed punctuation
    return (last_char.isalpha() and
            (not any(char in ALLOWED_PUNCTUATION for char in words[-1][:-1]))
           )
```

The function leverages the `isalpha()` method to check if the last character is an alphabetical character and examines the preceding characters to determine if it is a part of a word. The `ALLOWED_PUNCTUATION` set checks if certain punctuation marks separate the last character from its containing word. The function returns True if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and False otherwise. You can verify the functionality of the solution using the test cases provided in the original problem statement.
