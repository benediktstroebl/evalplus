```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    """
    Create a function that returns True if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and False otherwise.

    Parameters:
    txt (str): The input string to analyze.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, False otherwise.

    Examples:
    >>> check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie")
    False
    >>> check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e")
    True
    >>> check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e ")
    False
    >>> check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("")
    False

    def is_alphabetical(char):
        return char.isalpha()

    def is_last_char(txt):
        return txt[-1] == txt[-2] if len(txt) > 1 else False

    def is_not_part_of_word(txt):
        words = txt.split()

    return is_last_char(txt) and is_not_part_of_word(txt)
```

The approach adopted by the function is as follows:
1. A helper function 'is_alphabetical' was created to determine whether a character is alphabetical or not.
2. Another helper function 'is_last_char' was designed to determine whether the last character of the text is also the last but one character, implying it stands alone.
3. The helper function 'is_not_part_of_word' was created to ascertain whether the last character is not part of a word, namely, a single character or an alphabetical character at the end of a word.
4. The main function combines the three helper functions to finally return the desired result.
