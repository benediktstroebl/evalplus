```

The provided code defines a function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` that determines whether the final character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not a part of any word. It achieves this by examining the length of the string, validating if the last character is a letter, and checking if it is immediately preceded by a space. If these conditions are met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This solution adheres to the problem's requirement for the function to return `True` under the given conditions and appropriately addresses all the edge cases mentioned in the prompt. You can incorporate this code into your solution directly. I appreciate your patience throughout the revision process, which has ensured we reached an acceptable and clear solution.
