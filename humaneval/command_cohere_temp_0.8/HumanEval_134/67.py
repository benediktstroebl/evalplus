    # Split the string into words using whitespace characters as separators

    if not txt or not words:
        return False

```

The provided code snippet defines a function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` that performs a specific evaluation of the last character of a given input string. It works as follows:
1. The input string `txt` is split into individual words using whitespace characters as separators. This is achieved using the `split()` method, which splits the string at spaces and other whitespace characters.
2. The function checks if the input string is empty or contains no words. If either condition is true, it returns `False`, as there's no last character to evaluate.
3. If the above conditions are not met, it means there's a last character in the string that needs to be evaluated. The last character of the string is extracted from the list of split words.
4. Finally, the function returns `True` if the last character is an alphabetical character and it's not the same as the last character in the original input string (indicating it's not part of a word). Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This problem can be solved in various ways, but this solution opts for splitting the string and directly checking the last character.
