```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    """
    Create a function that returns True if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        txt (str): String to analyze.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, False otherwise.
    """
    # Define a variable to store the last character of the string
    last_char = txt[-1] if len(txt) > 0 else None

    # Check if the last character is a letter and not part of a word
    return (last_char.isalpha() and not txt.rsplit(' ')[-1].endswith(last_char)) if last_char else False
```

The function uses the `str.isalpha()` method to check if the last character of the string is an alphabetical character and the `str.endswith()` method to verify if the last character is part of a word.

The script also includes explicit arguments in the function definition (`str txt`) to improve code clarity and readability.
