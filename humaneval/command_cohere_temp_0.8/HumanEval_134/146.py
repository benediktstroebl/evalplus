    Create a function that returns True if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        txt (str): The input string to be evaluated.

        bool: True if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, False otherwise.

    # Define the string
    assert isinstance(txt, str), "Input 'txt' must be a string."

    # Check if the string is empty
    if not txt:
        return False

    # Remove trailing spaces, if any
    while txt and txt.endswith(" "):

``` 

The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` uses the following logic:
1. It first asserts that the input `txt` is of type `str`.
2. It then checks if the input string is empty and returns False if so.
3. It removes any trailing spaces with a while loop.
4. Finally, it checks if the last character is a letter and is not part of a word, using both the `isalpha()` and `split(" ")` methods. The `split(" ")` method divides the string into a list of substrings based on spaces, and the `-1` index is checked to see if it equals the last character.

The logic ensures that the last character is evaluated correctly regardless of the word composition in the string.
