```

This function leverages the `strip()` method to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces before examining the final character. The `isalpha()` method checks if the character is alphabetical, and `isalnum()` verifies if the character is alphanumeric (forming part of a potential word). The function returns True if the character is alphabetical and not part of a word; otherwise, it returns False.
