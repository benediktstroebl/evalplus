The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` serves the purpose of determining whether the final character of a given string is an alphabetical character and isn't part of a word. It takes a string (`txt`) as an argument and returns a boolean, namely `True` if the last character is a letter that isn't part of a word, and `False` otherwise. The string is first validated to ensure it is not empty. In the absence of any content, it returns `False`. In addition, it also removes any trailing spaces by utilizing `strip()`. The ultimate decision is made based on the evaluation of the last character. It is deemed to be a portion of a word if it is not the beginning of a string or a space and forms a word with the preceding character. The function efficiently handles both lowercase and uppercase alphabetic characters. 

The given examples in the comment demonstrate how the function operates on different inputs. The function produces the corresponding boolean values (`True` or `False`) for each example, thereby illustrating its functionality.
