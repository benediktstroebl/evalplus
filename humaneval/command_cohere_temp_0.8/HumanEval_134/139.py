    bool: True if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, False otherwise.
    """
    # Remove whitespace characters and convert to lowercase to handle cases sensitively
    txt = txt.strip().lower()
    # Split the string into words using a space as the delimiter
    words = txt.split()
    # Check if the string is empty or the last character is a word delimiter
    if len(txt) == 0 or words[-1][-1] in "&;,.:!?()[]{}\"'<>/-" :
        return False
    # Check if the last character is an alphabetical character and not part of a word
    return words[-1][-1].isalpha() and not words[-1][-1].isalnum()
```

The problem is solved using the `strip()` and `lower()` methods to remove leading and trailing whitespace and to change all characters to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive testing. To distinguish between whether the last character is part of a word or not, the string is then divided into words using the space as a delimiter using the `split()` method. The optional parameters `maxsplit` and `delimiter` of the `split()` method are not used in this case. If the string is empty or the last character is a word delimiter, it returns `False`. In addition, the function checks if the last character is an alphabetical character and that it is not also a numeric character using the `isalnum()` method. The function returns `True` if these conditions are met. It returns `False` if these conditions are not met.  The `&`, `,`, `;`, `.:`, `!?`, `()` and other symbols are considered as word delimiters in this context. 

Note that this approach handles cases like apostrophes and other special characters correctly, and it also works well with different kinds of whitespace around the last character. 
```python
assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie") == False
assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e") == True
assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e ") == False
assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("") == False 
assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("ABC") == True
