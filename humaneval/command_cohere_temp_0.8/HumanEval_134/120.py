```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    """
    Create a function that returns True if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and False otherwise.

    Parameters:
        txt (str): The input string to be evaluated.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, False otherwise.
    """
    # Trim any whitespace from the end of the string
    txt = txt.strip()

    # Check if the string ends with a space
    if txt.endswith(" "):
        return False

    # Check if the last character is a letter and not part of a word
    return txt[-1].lower() not in " .,:;"
```

The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` works by first stripping any whitespace from the end of the input string using the `strip()` method to ensure the longest whitespace-sensitive match. It then checks if the last character of the string is an alphabetical character by using the `lower()` method to disregard case and the `not in` operator to check if the character is not among the specified special characters `' .,:;'` which are common punctuation marks that would indicate the last character is part of a word. 

You can verify that the function works correctly by testing it with various inputs listed in the problem prompt:
```python
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie"))  # Should print False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e"))  # Should print True
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e "))  # Should print False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(""))  # Should print False
```
