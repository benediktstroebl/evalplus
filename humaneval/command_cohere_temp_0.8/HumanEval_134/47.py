    # Define the string ending criteria for the last character
    end_char_criteria = bool(txt) and (len(txt) > 0) and (isalpha(txt[-1]))
    # Check if the string ends with a space after the last character
    has_space_after_last_char = (txt[-1:] == " ")

    is_last_char_in_word = any(txt.endswith(word) for word in txt.split())
    # Determine the overall result based on the criteria
    return end_char_criteria and not (has_space_after_last_char or is_last_char_in_word)
```

Let's clarify the logic of how the script works:
1. Initially, the script defines a boolean variable `end_char_criteria` that evaluates whether the string meets the basic requirement of having at least one character and having a last character that is alphabetical.
2. Subsequently, the variable `has_space_after_last_char` evaluates whether the string ends with an additional space character after the last character.
3. Meanwhile, the variable `is_last_char_in_word` assesses whether the last character is a part of any word in the given string. Using `endswith()` and `split()` checks if any of the words end at the same position as the overall string.
4. Finally, the function returns `end_char_criteria` boolanned with the condition that `not (has_space_after_last_char or is_last_char_in_word)` to ensure that the last character is not part of a word and is an alphabetical character, but not if it ends with a space character.

This elaborate construct allows the function to determine whether the last character of a string meets the specified criteria.
