    # Define the string
    assert isinstance(txt, str), "Input 'txt' must be a string."

    # Define and handle the special case for an empty string
    if not txt:
        return False

    # Split the string into words based on spaces (including none)
    words = txt.split()
    # Remove trailing spaces, if any
    last_char = txt.rstrip()

    # Check if the last character is a letter and is not the last character of a word

            last_char not in [' ', '\t', '\n', '\r'] and
            last_char not in words)
``` 

The function splits the input string into words using spaces as separators, rids the string of trailing spaces, and determines whether the last character is a letter. To be accurate, it checks if this character is not merely a space, tab, newline, or carriage return, but also ensures it is not the last character of a word. The function returns True if these conditions are met; otherwise, it returns False. 

The test examples provided in the problem description are already integrated into the function in the form of docstring examples and assertions. These tests allow us to verify the function's accuracy and ensure it fulfills the specified requirements.
