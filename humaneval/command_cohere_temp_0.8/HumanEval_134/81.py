This code defines a function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` that analyzes a given string and returns `True` if the final character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word (i.e., if it's an isolated character). It returns `False` otherwise. The function also includes test assertions to validate the input type and output logic. You can use this code to test against different scenarios based on your needs.
