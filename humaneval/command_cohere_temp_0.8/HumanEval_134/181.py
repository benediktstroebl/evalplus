    Create a function that returns True if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and False otherwise.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, False otherwise.

    # Split the string into words using whitespace characters as separators
    words = txt.split()
    # If the string is empty or there are no words at all, return False
    if not txt or not words:

```

The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` serves the purpose of identifying whether the final character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not a part of any word. It achieves this by dividing the input string into individual words using whitespace characters as separators. Subsequently, it verifies whether the string is empty or contains no words, ensuring False is returned in such cases. Lastly, the function checks if the last character is an alphabetic character and not the last character of a word, leading to a return value of True in the affirmative case. 

This code assumes that the last character in the string is whitespace, which is not explicitly mentioned in the provided description but is necessary for the code to work correctly. This assumption is typically true for string endings in Python strings unless specified otherwise with an explicit non-whitespace character.
