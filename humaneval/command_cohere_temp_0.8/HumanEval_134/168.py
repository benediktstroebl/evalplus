        bool: True if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, False otherwise.
    """
    # Define and assign the variable for the last character in the input string
    last_char = txt[-1] if len(txt) > 0 else None
    
    # Check if the last character is alphabetical
    is_alphabetical = last_char is not None and last_char.isalpha()
    
    # Check if the last character is not part of a word
    is_not_part_of_word = True if is_alphabetical and txt.rsplit(' ', 1)[-1] == last_char else False
    
    # Return the boolean result of the condition:
    return is_alphabetical and is_not_part_of_word
```

Let's break down the logic:
1. **Last Character Check**: `last_char = txt[-1] if len(txt) > 0 else None` checks the last character of the input string `txt`. If the string is empty, it sets `last_char` to `None` to avoid errors later in alpha checks.
2. **Alphabetical Check**: `is_alphabetical = last_char is not None and last_char.isalpha()` checks if the last character is alphabetical. Both `last_char is not None` and `last_char.isalpha()` are required because if `last_char` is `None`, the latter condition would cause a `TypeError`.
3. **Not Part of a Word Check**: The nuanced check to determine if the last character is not part of a word is done with: `is_not_part_of_word = True if is_alphabetical and txt.rsplit(' ', 1)[-1] == last_char else False`. This uses string slicing and the `rsplit` method to split the string on spaces, specifically the latter condition `[last_char]` is what determines if the last character is part of a word. The function returns `True` if the last character is alphabetical and not part of a word and `False` otherwise.
