The provided Python script defines a function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` that performs the desired checks on the last character of a given string. It uses the `isalpha()` method to confirm if the last character is an alphabetical character and verifies if it is not part of the last word in the string. The function returns `True` if the last character satisfies these conditions and `False` otherwise. 

The summary of the logic is as follows:
1. Extract the last character of the string, considering and removing any whitespace characters.
2. Check if the last character is a letter using `isalpha()`.
3. If the last character is a letter, check if it is not part of the last word in the string by comparing it with the last element of the split word. 

The function includes a docstring providing detailed explanations of the problem, parameters, and return values, enabling easy understanding and usage of the function. A usage example is also given, demonstrating the behavior of the function. 

Note: The problem statement mentions that an empty string is also a test case. However, the provided solution does not address this case in the `strip()` and `split(' ')` methods. It could be improved by handling this edge case explicitly.
