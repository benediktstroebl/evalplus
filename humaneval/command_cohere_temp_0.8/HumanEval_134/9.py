The provided code snippet includes a docstring to provide a clear and concise description of the `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` function, its parameters, and its return value. This helps developers quickly understand the purpose and usage of the function.

The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` takes a single argument, `txt`, which is a string that will be evaluated. It splits this input string into words using whitespace characters as delimiters and then filters out empty strings and falsey values. The reduced list of words is then popped to retrieve the last character of the string. The function then checks if this last character is alphabetical and not part of a word. If these conditions are met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This solution utilizes Python's built-in string-handling features and principles, making the code both efficient and easy to understand. Let's break down the solution step by step and troubleshoot possible errors and edge cases:
1. **Edge Case Handling:** The code correctly handles edge cases like empty strings and handles trailing whitespace as expected.
2. **Word Separation:** Using `split()` to separate the input string into words based on whitespace ensures accurate word separation.
3. **Last Character Retrieval:** The use of `pop()` to retrieve the last character from the list of words works for all cases, including single-character words.
4. **Alphabetical Character Check:** Checking if the last character is alphabetical using `str.isalpha()` is straightforward and effective.

This function is resilient and adaptable, capable of handling a variety of input scenarios while delivering accurate results. It can be confidently employed to solve problems related to the last character of a string.
