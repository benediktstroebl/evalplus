```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    """
    Create a function that returns True if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and False otherwise.

    Parameters:
    txt (str): The input string to be evaluated.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, False otherwise.

    Examples:
    >>> check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie")
    False
    >>> check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e")
    True
    >>> check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e ")
    False
    >>> check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("")
    False
    """
    # Ensure the input is a string and is not empty
    if not isinstance(txt, str) or not txt:
        return False

    # Split the string into words and check if the last character is separate from words and is a letter
    return ((txt.count(' ') + 1) == txt.split(' ').index(txt[-1])) and txt[-1].isalpha()
```

The function checks if the last character of the input string `txt` is an alphabetical character and is not part of any word in the string. It returns True if the condition is met and False otherwise. This is done using the built-in `isalpha()` function and by evaluating if the last character is part of any word in the split string (`txt.split(' ')`), and if it is the last character of the string or the last character is a part of a word, therefore, not a standalone letter, respectively. The function also ensures the input is a string and is not empty, returning False for such inputs.

The examples given in the original prompt correspond to the test cases we provide to verify the correctness of the function.  The function should return `False` for the first two cases, and `True` for the last two cases.
