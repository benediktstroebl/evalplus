The provided code snippet introduces a function named `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` designed to evaluate whether the final character of a given string is an alphabetical character that is not part of a word. To achieve this, the function first isolates the last character using slicing (`last_char = txt[-1:]`) and then checks its length (ensuring it's a single character) and alphabetic nature through the `str.isalpha()` function. If these criteria aren't met, the function returns False. 

Should the last character pass these initial checks, the function proceeds to examine whether the character is part of a word. It achieves this by splitting the input string into individual words (`words = txt.split()`) and then verifying if the last character is present in the most recent word (using `if last_char in words[-1]`). If the last character is encountered within a word, the function returns False. However, if the last character is not part of any word, True is returned. 

The function is equipped with a straightforward interface, taking an input string and yielding a boolean value (True or False) based on the criteria specified. This makes it an accessible and adaptable solution to applications requiring scrutiny of string endings in Python. 

The unit tests for this function can be added as a separate code block. Here is an example of adding unit tests using the `unittest` module:
