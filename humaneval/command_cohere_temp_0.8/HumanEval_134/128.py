The provided code snippet includes a function named `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` accepting one parameter, a string named `txt`. This function assesses the ultimate character of the given string, checking if it's an alphabetic character not connected to any word. The function returns `True` if this condition holds, and `False` otherwise. 

The function's logic first splits the string into separate words using space characters as separators. If the string is empty or contains no words, it's considered false and returns `False`. Then, it joins the last two words of the array, stripping any spaces. The function returns `True` if this character is an alphabetical character not part of a word. These conditions are checked using Python's built-in `bool()` and `isalpha()` functions.
