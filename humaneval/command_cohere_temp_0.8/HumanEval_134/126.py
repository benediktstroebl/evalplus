This function:
1. Assumes that the last character is not part of any word if it is a letter and the last character is the first character of a word (i.e., no space characters behind). This assumption might be true for the provided examples, but potentially could be false in other cases. 
2. Handles the edge case where the input string is empty by returning False as per the function's specification. 

This approach solves the problem but assumes certain cases to be true. You may need to adjust the assumptions or add additional checks if you have different requirements or edge cases in your dataset. 

Ensure you adjust the assumptions according to your specific use case for a more robust solution. 
Let me know if I have understood the requirements correctly or if youâ€™d like to clarify anything else! Feel free to provide additional examples, and I will modify my approach accordingly.
