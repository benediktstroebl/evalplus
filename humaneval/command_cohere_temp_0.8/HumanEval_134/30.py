    Create a function that returns True if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and False otherwise.

    Parameters:
    txt (str): The input string to analyze.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, False otherwise.

    Examples:
    >>> check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie")
    False
    >>> check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e")
    True
    >>> check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e ")

The function `is_last_char_not_in_word` is introduced as a helper function to isolate and focus on the core logic of the `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` function, improving code readability and maintainability. It checks if the last character of the given string is whitespace, and if so, it returns True. If the last character is not whitespace, it extracts the last character and iterates over the words in the string to determine if the last character is part of any word. If it's not part of any word, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. 

The main logic in `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` calls `is_last_char_not_in_word` to determine whether the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word. The edge case of an empty string is also handled, returning False since an empty string has no last character to analyze. 

The expected behavior for given examples is:
```
>>> check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie")
False
>>> check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e")
True
>>> check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e ")
False
>>> check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("")
False
``` 
This updated code fully addresses the problem statement and provides correct and more robust functionality.
