The provided Python script defines a function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` that assesses the last character of a given string, `txt`. The function returns `True` if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word in the string, and `False` otherwise. The function first trims any leading and trailing whitespace from the input string and then checks if it's empty. If the string is not empty, it checks if the last character is a letter and not the last character of a word in the string. The function utilizes the `rsplit` method to divide the string into words and identify the position of the last character in consideration. Subsequently, it verifies if the last character is an alphabetical character by checking if it matches any character in the string `letters`, which encompasses all alphabetical characters. If these conditions are met, the function returns `True`, signifying that the last character is an alphabetical character not part of any word. Conversely, if these conditions are not fulfilled, it returns `False`, indicating that the last character is not an alphabetical character or is part of a word. The given examples in the prompt are also correctly solved by the script. 
This is a robust solution that is accurate and efficient in handling the presented problem statement.  certain tests cases that could be used to punctuate and strengthen the efficacy of this code

Here is a test suite with additional test cases to further validate the correctness of the `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` function:
```python
def test_check_if_last_char_is_a_letter():
    # Case: Valid last character, not part of a word
    assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e") == True

    # Case: Valid last character, but part of a word
    assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie") == False

    # Case: Empty string
    assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("") == False

    # Case: Whitespace only
    assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("    ") == False

    # Case: Last character is a letter, but not the last character of a word
    assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e ") == True

    # Case: Non-alphabetical character
    assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e^") == False
