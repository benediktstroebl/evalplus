The provided code snippet has the desired function, `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter`, which returns `True` if the last character of the given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and `False` otherwise. The `txt` parameter is the input string to be evaluated.

This function works correctly as described in the given problem. Here is a brief explanation of how it accomplishes the task:
1. The function starts by reducing the string length by 1 to focus on the last character solely.
2. It then checks whether the string's length is smaller than 1 or the last character is a space. If any of these conditions are met, it returns False, as the last character is not suitable.
3. If the last character is not a space, it checks if it's an alphabetical character using the `isalpha()` method.
4. If the last character is a letter, it further checks whether it is the last character of the string or not. If it is, the function returns True, but if it is not, it returns False, which completes the problem statement's criteria.
