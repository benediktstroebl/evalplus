    Create a function that returns True if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and False otherwise.

    Parameters:
    txt (str): The input string to be evaluated.

    bool: True if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, False otherwise.
    """
    # Ensure the input is a string
    if not isinstance(txt, str):
        raise TypeError("The input must be a string")

    # Check if the string is empty
    if not txt:
        return False

    # Remove any whitespace at the end of the string (if present)
    txt = txt.strip()

    # Check if the last character is a letter and not part of a word
    # Note: The split() method returns a list of words (tokens) in the string,
    # and the index -1 refers to the last element (the last character of the string)
    if txt.split()[-1].isalpha() and txt.split()[-1] not in txt.split():
        return True

    return False
```

The function uses the following logic:
1. It first checks if the input string `txt` is empty or not. If it's empty, it returns `False` because there's no last character to check.
2. It then removes any trailing whitespace from the input string (using the `strip()` method), so that the checking is consistent and independent of whether the input string had leading or trailing whitespaces.
3. It then checks if the last character of the string is a letter using the `isalpha()` method.
4. Finally, it checks if the last character is not part of any word (token) in the input string using the split() method to split the input string into words and checking if the last character is not equal to any of the words.

The following examples illustrate how this function operates:
1. `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie") -> False`: The last character is an alphabetical character, but it's part of the word "pie", so it returns False.
2. `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e") -> True`: The last character is an alphabetical character, but it's not part of any word so it returns True.
3. `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e ") -> False`: Same as above, but with trailing whitespace.
4. `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("") -> False`: Empty string, so it returns False. 
The script covers edge cases and aligns with the problem's explanation, ensuring the last character is a letter and not part of a word.
