    Create a function that returns True if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and False otherwise.

    Parameters:
    txt (str): The input string to be evaluated.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, False otherwise.

    Examples:
    >>> check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie")
    False

    True

This Python script defines a function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` that evaluates the last character of an input string and determines if it is an alphabetical character not forming a part of any word. The function returns `True` if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and `False` otherwise. This determination relies on both the character's alphabetic nature and its position at the end of the input string. The provided examples illustrate proper usage and expectation of the function.
