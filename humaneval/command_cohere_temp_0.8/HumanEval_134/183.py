The provided code defines a function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` that performs the specified checks on the last character of a given string. It determines whether the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of any word in the string. The function returns `True` if the condition is met and `False` otherwise. 

The script includes comments and docstrings that clarify the code's purpose and functionality. Additionally, it responds to the examples provided in the problem statement, returning the appropriate values (True or False) in each case.

This code can be incorporated into larger programs to verify conditions related to the last character of a string.
