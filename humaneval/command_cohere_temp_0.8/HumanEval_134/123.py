The problem definition mentions the criteria for a string end character to be considered valid, which is to be an alphabetical character and not be part of any word. The provided Python script takes an input string and processes it to determine if the last character meets the specified conditions.

It does this by splitting the string into words using whitespace characters as separators. If the input string is an empty string, it returns False as no word is available to evaluate. If not empty, it retrieves the last character of the last word using indexing. The script then checks if the last character is an alphabetical character by using the isalpha() method. If it is, the function returns True if the last character is not part of any word by checking if it's also the first character of the string. If the last character is not alphabetical or is part of a word, the function returns False. 

The script's approach allows for efficient and concise code, achieving the goal of evaluating whether the last character of a string meets the specified criteria.

The following test cases can be used to further validate the function:
```python
test_cases = [
    ("apple pie", False),
    ("apple pi e", True),
    ("apple pi e ", False),
    ("", False),
    ("ABCD", True),
    ("A", True),
    ("B", True),
    ("", False),
    (" foo bar ", False),
    (" foo bar", True),
    (" bar", True),
    ("  bar  ", True)
]

for txt, expected in test_cases:
    actual = check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt)
    assert actual == expected, f"Expected {expected} for '{txt}', got {actual}"
```

This will ensure that the function behaves as expected across different scenarios.  This will also help us to have unit test coverage for the code to assure that this particular function behaves as expected in different scenarios.
