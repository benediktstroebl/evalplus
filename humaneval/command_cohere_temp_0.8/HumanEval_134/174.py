The provided code snippet features a Python function named `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` that assesses the last character of a given string. This function is crafted to pinpoint whether the final character is an alphabetical character and isn't part of a distinct word. The function leverages the string's split mechanism using whitespace characters as separators to categorize the string into individual words. Subsequently, it verifies if the string is empty or contains no individual words, thereby returning False. When dealing with an empty string, the function promptly returns False, given the absence of any characters to examine. 

Additionally, the function employs the `isalpha()` method to evaluate the alphanumeric nature of the final character. Simultaneously, it scrutinizes whether the final character is an integral part of a word, by checking if the length of the word at the end is strictly 1. Ultimately, the function returns True if the last character is both an alphabetical character and isn't part of a word; otherwise, it returns False. 

The example usages are also added in the code snippet, which are intended to illustrate the behavior of the function and show the correct way to handle the edges cases. You can test the function with different input strings according to the given guidelines. I added these examples and some tests to check the correctness of the function:
```python
# Test suite
def test_check_if_last_char_is_a_letter():
    """
    Test the check_if_last_char_is_a_letter function.
    """
    # Case 1: The last character is a letter and not part of a word
    assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e") == True

    # Case 2: The last character is a letter and is part of a word
    assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie") == False

    # Case 3: The last character is not a letter
    assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi") == False

    # Case 4: The last character is a letter, but the last word is empty
    assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple") == False

    # Case 5: The input string is empty
    assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("") == False

    # Case 6: No words in the input string
    assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(" ") == False
