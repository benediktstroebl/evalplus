    # Define the string
    assert isinstance(txt, str), "Input 'txt' must be a string."

```

The function uses regular expressions to check if the last character of the string is not part of a word (i.e., it's a freestanding letter). The function returns True if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and False otherwise. You can use it by calling the function with a string as an input like this:
```python
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie"))  # Expected output: False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e"))  # Expected output: True
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e "))  # Expected output: False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(""))  # Expected output: False
``` 

The test cases correspond to the examples provided in the problem statement.
