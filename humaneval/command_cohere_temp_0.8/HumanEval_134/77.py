    Create a function that returns True if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and False otherwise.

    Parameters:
        txt (str): The input string to be evaluated.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, False otherwise.
    """
    # Split the string into words using whitespace characters as delimiters
    words = txt.split()
    # If the string is empty or there are no words at all, return False
    if not txt or not words:
        return False
    # Check if the last character is a letter and not the last character of a word
    return txt[-1].isalpha() and txt[-1] != words[-1][-1]
```

The function splits the input string into words using whitespace characters as delimiters, then checks if the string is empty or if there are no words at all.

Finally, it verifies if the last character is a letter and not the last character of the last word, using the `isalpha()` method for the last character and comparing it with the last character of the last word obtained from the `split()` method.

This approach ensures that the last character is independently evaluated regardless of its position in any word.
