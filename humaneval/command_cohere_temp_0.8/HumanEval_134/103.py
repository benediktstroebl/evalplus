```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    """
    Create a function that returns True if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        txt (str): Input string to analyze.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, False otherwise.
    """
    # Define and assign the regex pattern
    word_pattern = r'\w+'
    # Check if the string is empty
    if not txt:
        return False
    while txt[-1] not in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ':
        if txt[-1] not in word_pattern:
            return False
        txt = txt[:-1]
    return True
```

The following factors were considered when crafting the approach:
1. **Understanding the Problem:** We must ascertain whether the final character of the string is either a letter or a number, and also ensure it is not part of a "word."
2. **Iterative Process:** The solution iteratively checks each character from the end of the string to the beginning.
3. **Regex Pattern:** The regular expression pattern `\w+` helps identify each word in the string.
4. **Edge Cases:** We consider edge cases such as an empty string or a string with leading spaces.

This approach allows the function to accurately determine the last character's nature and its relationship to the preceding words in the provided string.
