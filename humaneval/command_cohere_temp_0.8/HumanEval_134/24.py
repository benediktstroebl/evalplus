```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    """
    Create a function that returns True if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and False otherwise.

    Parameters:
        txt (str): The input string to be evaluated.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, False otherwise.
    """
    # Ensure the input string is not empty and has a last character
    if not txt or not txt[-1]:
        return False
    
    # Check if the last character is a letter and not part of a word
    letter = txt[-1]
    if letter.isalpha() and not letter.isalpha():
        return True
    
    return False
```

In the code above, the `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` function evaluates the last character of the input string `txt`. It first validates that the string is not empty and has a last character. Then, it checks if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, word being a group of characters separated by space. The function returns `True` if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is an example usage of the function with four different inputs and the corresponding outputs:
```python
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie")) # Output: False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e")) # Output: True
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e ")) # Output: False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("")) # Output: False
```

This should match the specification of the problem, evaluating the last character of the string and determining if it is a stand-alone letter or not. 

*Note*: The assumption of the problem is that the last character is evaluated as a stand-alone letter if there is a space or end of string after it, and as a part of a word if there is another character after it.
