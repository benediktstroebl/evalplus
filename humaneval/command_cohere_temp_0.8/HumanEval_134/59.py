This script splits the provided input string into a list of words based on spaces and indexes to identify the last character. It then checks if this last character is an alphabetical character and not part of a word. If it's alphabetical, but potentially part of a word, it further examines its context to confirm if it's punctuation or part of a word. The function returns `True` if the last character satisfies these conditions, and `False` otherwise. 

The function also accounts for the scenario where the input string is an empty string, handling it to return `False` as there's no last character to evaluate. 

This solution covers all scenarios described in the markdown code block and complies with Python styling and syntax conventions. Let me know if you would like to proceed with additional functionality or improvements.
