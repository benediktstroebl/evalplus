```

This function uses the `strip()` method to remove any whitespace characters at the end of the string. Then, the `isalpha()` method is used to check if the last character is alphabetical. Afterward, the `isspace()` method checks if the last character is a space, and using the `split()` method, it checks if the last character is not part of a word. The split method divides the string into a list of substrings using whitespace as the delimiter. Finally, the last element of this list is checked to determine if it is empty, which means that the last character is not part of a word.
