The provided code defines a function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` that determines whether the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word. The function achieves this by checking if the last character of the string is alphabetic and if the last element of the split string is not an alphabetic character, which indicates that the last character is a standalone letter and not part of a word. The function handles cases where the input string is empty or contains leading or trailing spaces, ensuring accurate functionality regardless of these considerations.
