The provided code defines a function that takes a string as input and returns `True` if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word (i.e., not preceded by a space character). Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This solution adheres to the problem description provided in the prompt and should effectively pass the accompanying tests. It is concise and straightforward, utilizing string manipulation and Python's `isalpha()` method to achieve the desired outcome.
