    Create a function that returns True if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and False otherwise.

The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` serves the purpose of identifying whether the final character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not a constituent of a word. To achieve this, the function comprises two auxiliary functions: `is_alphabetical` verifies if a character is alphabetical, whereas `is_not_word` checks whether a character is not part of a word.

The main function initially verifies if the input string is empty or not. In the case of an empty string, it returns `False` because there is no character to evaluate. Subsequently, the function isolates the ultimate character from the input string, taking into consideration special characters that can legitimately be appended to strings (e.g., space, tab, hyphen, underscore, quotation mark, and apostrophe). The function then uses the two auxiliary functions to ascertain whether the last character is an alphabetical character and not part of a word. 

The overall time complexity of the code is O(1), indicating that it performs the desired checks efficiently in a single operation.
