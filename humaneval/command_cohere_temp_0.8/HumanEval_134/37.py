    bool: True if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, False otherwise.
    """
    # Split the string into words using whitespace characters as separators
    words = txt.split()
    if len(words) == 0:
        # If an empty string is provided, return False as there are no characters nor words.
        return False
    elif len(words) == 1:
        # If there is only one word, check if the last character is a letter and is not part of a word.
        return txt[-1].isalpha() and txt[-1] not in words[0]
    else:
        # If multiple words are present, ensure the last character is not part of the last word.
        return txt[-1] not in words[-1]
```

This function splits the input string into words using whitespace characters as separators. 

It then:
- Checks if the input string is an empty string and returns False, as there are no characters nor words.
- Checks if there's only one word, it verifies if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of that word.
- In the case of multiple words, the function verifies if the last character is not part of the last word.

Thus, the function returns `True` if the last character of the given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and `False` otherwise. 

The expected behavior is for the function to return:
```
True
```
For the input:
```
check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e")
```
And:
```
False
```
For the input:
```
check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie")
```
And:
```
False
```
For the input:
```
check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e ")
```
And:
```
True
```
For the input:
```
check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("")
```
This approach avoids unnecessary character checking and directly identifies if the last character is part of a word or not. It helps improve performance and provide clearer code comprehension.
