This Python script defines a function called `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter`, which assesses whether the final character of a provided string `txt` is an alphabetical character and isn't a component of a word. The function begins by confirming the input's string type and then processes the text depending on these conditions:
1. In the event that the string is empty, the function returns False (since any conclusion drawn would be futile).
2. The function removes any trailing spaces to deal with any strings that end with spaces.
3. Ultimately, the function verifies if the final character meets the criteria by examining it to a pre-defined list of alphabetical characters that are not part of any word. The function returns True if it is not one of these characters; otherwise, it returns False. 

This solution has a docstring that explains the problem and the behavior of the function, and it also includes tests to ensure the function behaves as expected. You can use the `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` function as mentioned in the markdown code block provided.
