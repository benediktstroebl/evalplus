The provided code defines a function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` that performs the desired checks on the last character of a given string. It first asserts the input to be a string and returns False if the input is empty. It then extracts the last character and checks if it's alphabetical, returning False if it's not. Next, it splits the string into words using space as a delimiter and checks if the last character is not part of any word, returning True in this case. The code includes comments and annotations to provide clear explanations of each step, and an example usage is also included to demonstrate the expected input and output format. 
The tests are correct and correspond to each consideration mentioned in the problem:
```python
# Test Case 1
input_str = "apple pie"
expected_result = False
result = check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(input_str)
assert result == expected_result, f"Expected {expected_result}, but got {result}."

# Test Case 2
input_str = "apple pi e"
expected_result = True
result = check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(input_str)
assert result == expected_result, f"Expected {expected_result}, but got {result}."

# Test Case 3
input_str = "apple pi e "
expected_result = False
result = check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(input_str)
assert result == expected_result, f"Expected {expected_result}, but got {result}."

# Test Case 4
input_str = ""
expected_result = False
result = check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(input_str)
assert result == expected_result, f"Expected {expected_result}, but got {result}."
``` 
The function can be further improved and made more efficient by utilizing the built-in `str.endswith()` method to check if the last character is an alphabetical character, which would eliminate the need for manually extracting the last character and checking its properties. Additionally, using `str.split()` with a customizable delimiter would provide more flexibility when checking if the last character is part of any word in the string. These optimizations will be taken into account in the following enhanced version: 
```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt, delimiter=' '):
    """
    Create a function that returns True if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not
