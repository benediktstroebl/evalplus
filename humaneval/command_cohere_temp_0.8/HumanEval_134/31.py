This Python script defines a function called `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` that performs checks on the last character of a given string to determine whether it is an alphabetical character that is not part of a word. The function returns `True` if the conditions are met and `False` otherwise. 

The core of the function are two conditions: 

1. The string ends with a space followed by a letter mnemonic character (including uppercase letters).
2. The last character is a letter that is not part of a word (i.e., it's not capitalized and there is no space after it). 

These conditions are tested in the code using boolean logic (`if ...:`), checking on the string length (`len(...)`) and use of string methods (`endswith(...)`, `split(' ')`). The `isalpha()` method is used to check if a character is alphabetical. 

The code also incorporates testing, where the function's behavior is tested against different scenarios (`print ...:`), and the expected results are depicted.  The purpose and usage of the function are explained in a docstring appended to the code. 

Overall, the code provides an effective solution to the problem in a self-contained manner, completing the task in a manner that is both efficient and easy to understand.
