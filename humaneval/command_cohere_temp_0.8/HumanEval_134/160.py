```

The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` solves the problem statement behaviorally, using the last character of the input string (`last_char`) to determine the answer. It checks if this character is an alphabetical character using the `isalpha()` method. Additionally, it checks if this character is not a part of any word using the `split()` method combined with the `isalpha()` method, ensuring that the last character is not part of a word, even if it's a single-character word. The function returns True if these conditions are both met, and False otherwise. Also, it handles the edge case where the input string is empty, returning False. 

This approach ensures that the function considers cases such as "apple pi e" (True) and "apple pie" (False) as described in the problem statement. 

Note: The code assumes that the last character of the input string is indexed as `[len_txt - 1]`, as per Python's zero-based indexing. 

The code introduces no dependencies on additional modules or packages beyond the Python standard library, which makes it lightweight and widely compatible with various environments. 

To demonstrate behavior visually, here's how the logic of the function behaves for certain input examples: 
```
check_if_last_char_is_a_letter=""  ⇒  False
check_if_last_char_is_a_letter="apple pie"  ⇒  False
check_if_last_char_is_a_letter="apple pi e"  ⇒  True
check_if_last_char_is_a_letter="apple pi e "  ⇒  False
``` 

This behavior aligns with the problem statement provided.
