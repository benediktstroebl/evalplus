```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    """
    Create a function that returns True if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        txt (str): String to analyze.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, False otherwise.
    """
    # Define the string minus the last character
    incomplete_string = txt[:-1]
    # Check if the last character is part of a word
    return not txt.endswith(incomplete_string.split()) and txt[-1].isalpha()
```

The provided code defines a function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` that determines whether the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word. To do this, it first removes the last character from the string and stores it as `incomplete_string`. Then, it checks if the last character is part of any word in the incomplete string using the `endswith` method with `incomplete_string.split()` to see if the last character is separated by space. Additionally, it verifies that the last character is an alphabetical character using the `isalpha()` method. The function returns `True` if the last character satisfies these conditions, and `False` otherwise.
