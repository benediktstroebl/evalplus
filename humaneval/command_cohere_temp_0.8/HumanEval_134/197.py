```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    """
    Create a function that returns True if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        txt (str): The input string to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the last character is an alphabetical character not part of a word, False otherwise.
    """
    # Extract the last character and remove any whitespace if present
    last_char = txt.strip()[-1:]
    
    # Check if the last character is a letter
    if not last_char.isalpha():
        return False
    
    # Check if the last character is not part of a word
    if last_char.isalnum(): 
        return True
    else:
        # Check if the last character is a single character and not alphabetic
        if len(last_char) == 1 and not last_char.lower() in 'xyz':
            return False
        else:
            return True
```

The provided solution leverages the `str.isalnum()` method to check if the last character exists within a word, ensuring it's not separated by spaces or punctuation, and the `str.isalpha()` method to validate if the last character is an alphabetical character. Additionally, a special case handles scenarios where the last character is a single character and not alphabetic, checking for 'x', 'y', or 'z'. 

The tests are omitted as you requested a self-contained script, but you can easily add them by creating a `test_func()` function and asserting the behavior against expected results. 
```python
# Test the Function
def test_func():
    # Test 1
    assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie") == False
    # Test 2
    assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e") == True
    # Test 3
    assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e ") == False
    # Test 4
    assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("") == False 
    # Test 5
    assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("hello") == True
```
You can integrate this test function into the script to verify the expected behavior.
