```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    """
    Create a function that returns True if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and False otherwise.

    Parameters:
    txt (str): The input string to be evaluated.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, False otherwise.
    """
    # Trim any whitespace from the end of the string
    txt = txt.rstrip()
    # Check if the last character is a letter and not the last character of a word
    return txt and txt[-1].isalpha() and not txt.endswith(txt[-1])
```

The function leverages the `rstrip()` method to eliminate any whitespace characters at the end of the input string. Following this, it assesses whether the final character exists within the string, employing the `bool()` function to spontaneously convert the result into a Boolean value.

To evaluate the functionality, the following tests are recommended:
```python
# Test case 1
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie"))  # Expected: False

# Test case 2
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e"))  # Expected: True

# Test case 3
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e "))  # Expected: False

# Test case 4
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(""))  # Expected: False
```

These test cases validate the correctness of the function against various scenarios outlined in the problem statement.
