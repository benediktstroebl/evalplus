The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter()` serves the purpose of determining whether the final character of a given string is an alphabetical character and isn't part of a word. A word is defined as a collection of characters separated by spaces. The parameter is a string (`txt`) and the function returns a boolean, which is either True or False.

This function exploits the boolean evaluation of the last character, which is an alphabetical character, and that the last character is not
