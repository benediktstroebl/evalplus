This code defines a function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` that performs checks on the last character of the input `txt` parameter. It first retrieves the last character using the `last_char = txt[-1]` indexing expression.

Next, it checks whether this last character is an alphabetical character using the `isalpha()` string method, which returns `True` if the last character is an alphabet character and `False` otherwise.

If the last character is an alphabetical character, it further checks if this character is part of a word. A word is defined here as a group of characters separated by spaces, hyphens, or underscores. This is done using the logical `and` operator to combine two conditional checks:
1. `last_char == '-' or last_char == '_' or last_char == ' ' or last_char == '\n'` checks if the last character is a space, hyphen, or underscore.
2. `last_char != ' '` checks if the last character is not a space.

If any of these conditions are met, the function returns `False`, indicating that the last character is part of a word. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The example tests provided in the prompt output are implemented with the `print` function, which prints the result of each function call. You can add additional tests as needed to further validate the function.
