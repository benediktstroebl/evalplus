```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    """
    Create a function that returns True if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and False otherwise.

    Parameters:
        txt (str): The input string to be checked.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, False otherwise.
    """
    # Extracting the last character and checking if it belongs to the alphabet
    alpha = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    if txt and txt[-1] in alpha:
        # Checking if the last character is not part of a word
        tokens = txt.split()

    return False
```

The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` takes a single argument `txt`  which is the string to be checked.

It first checks if the last character of the string belongs to the alphabet set or not. If the character is not an alphabetical character, it returns False. 

If the character is an alphabetical character, it proceeds to check if the last character is part of a 'word'. It does so by splitting the string into a list of tokens using spaces as delimiter, and then checking if the last character is equal to the last token in the list. 

If the aforementioned conditions are fulfilled, the function returns True, and False otherwise. 

The markdown code block describes a function that can be used to efficiently determine whether the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word.  This utility can be useful for anyone needing to validate or manipulate strings in Python. 

You can easily integrate it into your own project or use it as a base for further experimentation and development.  You can also modify the function to accommodate different character sets or changing the definition of 'word' according to your specific needs.
