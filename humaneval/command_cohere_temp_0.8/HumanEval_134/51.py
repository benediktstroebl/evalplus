```

This code snippet defines a function named `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` that assesses whether the final character of a provided string is an alphabetical character and does not constitute a part of any word. The function employs the `isalpha()` method to verify if the last character is indeed an alphabet character and checks if it is a space or a newline to confirm that it is not part of a word. The function ultimately returns True if the condition is met and False otherwise.
