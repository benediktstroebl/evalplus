The problem statement poses the issue of determining if the final character of a given string is an alphabetical character but not part of any word. Our goal is to create a function that accurately addresses this requirement.

To achieve this, we first divide the input string into an array of individual words using space characters as delimiters. This allows us to examine the last character in isolation. If the string is empty, we return False since there are no characters to evaluate.

We then examine the last character of the last word in two ways: first, by employing the `str.isalpha()` function to determine if it is an alphabetical character, and second, by verifying if it isn't part of any word in the entire string. This is done by comparing it to the concatenated words without spaces.

In summary, the function returns True when the last character is both an alphabetical character and isn't part of any word in the input string; it returns False in all other cases.
