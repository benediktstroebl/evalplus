```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    """
    Create a function that returns True if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and False otherwise.

    Parameters:
    txt (str): The input string to be evaluated.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the last character is an alphabetical character not part of a word, False otherwise.
    """
    # Ensure the input string is not empty and has a last character
    if not txt or not txt[-1]:
        return False
    
    # Check if the last character is a letter and not a part of a word
    return (txt[-1].isalpha() and not txt.split()[-1])
```

The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` leverages the string's last character's alphaicity and its context to determine if it's a standalone letter. 

This approach ensures that the function remains straightforward and effective, providing the specified functionality without requiring additional dependencies or excessive complexity.
