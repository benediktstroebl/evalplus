The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` serves the purpose of determining whether the final character of a given string is an alphabetical character and isn't a part of any word. The function achieves this by dividing the input string into individual words and examining the last character. It declares the symbolic constant `WORDS` as a list containing the words of interest. The function is then illustrated through several examples, demonstrating its behavior when provided with different input strings.

The expected boolean values are returned by the function for the given input:
- `apple pie`: False
- `apple pi e`: True
- `apple pi e `: False
- ``: False
