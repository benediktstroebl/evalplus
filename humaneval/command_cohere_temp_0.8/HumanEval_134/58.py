```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    """
    Create a function that returns True if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        txt (str): The input string to be evaluated.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, False otherwise.
    """
    # Define the string length to retrieve the last character
    last_char = txt[-1]
    # Check if the last character is a letter and it is not an acronym/part of a word
    is_last_char_not_in_word = (len(txt) >= 2 and txt[-2] != ' ')
    return (last_char.isalpha() and is_last_char_not_in_word)
```

Let's break down the code:
1. The function defines an input argument as a string and assigns it to the variable `txt`.
2. The last character of the input string is extracted by indexing the last index of the string (`last_char = txt[-1]`).
3. A boolean variable named `is_last_char_not_in_word` is initialized to determine whether the last character is part of a word or an acronym. It checks the length of the string and verifies if the second-to-last character is a space (`len(txt) >= 2 && txt[-2] != ' '`).
4. The function returns `True` if the last character is an alphabetical character and it's not part of any word, which is determined by the condition `last_char.isalpha() && is_last_char_not_in_word`.

You can verify the function's behavior by running the following tests:
```python
test_cases = [
    ("apple pie", False),
    ("apple pi e", True),
    ("apple pi e ", False),
    ("", False),
    ("ABC", True),
    ("ABCD", False),
]

for test in test_cases:
    assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(*test) == test[1]
```

This block of tests validates the function against different scenarios to ensure it conforms to the problem statement.
