    # Define the string

    # Check if the string is empty
    if not txt:
        return False

    # Remove any whitespace at the end of the string (to not consider last char as part of a word)

The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` works by first ensuring that the input `txt` is a string and then checking if it is empty. If it is empty, the function returns `False` since an empty string has no last character to examine.

Next, it uses the `strip()` method to remove any trailing whitespace from the input string. This is done to ensure that if there's a space character at the end of the string, it won't be considered as part of a "word" when the last character is examined.

After this, the function checks two conditions simultaneously:
1. `txt[-1].isalpha()`: This checks if the last character of the input string `txt` is an alphabetical character.
2. `not txt.split(' ')[-1].isalpha()`: This condition checks if the last character is not part of a "word". It does this by using the `split(' ')` method to split the input string into a list of substrings based on spaces. The `[-1]` index is used to refer to the last element in this list (i.e., the last substring), and `isalpha()` checks if this last substring is composed only of alphabetical characters. 

If both conditions are True, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
