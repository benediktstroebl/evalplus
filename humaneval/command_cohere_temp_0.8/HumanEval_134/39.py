```

The provided code defines a function called `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter`, which takes a single argument, `txt`, and returns `True` if the last character of the input string `txt` is an alphabetical character and is not part of any word in the string, and `False` otherwise.

The function first splits the input string into a list of words using whitespace characters as delimiters. It then checks if the string is empty or if the list of words is empty, returning `False` in either case. It then extracts the last character of the input string and verifies if it's an alphabetical character, and not the same as the last character in the original input string but as a standalone character, which checks whether it's part of a word. Finally, the function returns `True` if these conditions are met. 

This solution covers the various edge cases mentioned in the problem statement and should provide a correct and efficient solution to the task. Feel free to test it with different inputs to ensure it meets your requirements.
