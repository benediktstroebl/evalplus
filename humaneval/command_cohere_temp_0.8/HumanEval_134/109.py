```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    """
    Create a function that returns True if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and False otherwise.

    Parameters:
    txt (str): The input string to be evaluated.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, False otherwise.
    """
    # Split the string into words using whitespace characters as separators
    words = txt.split()
    # Check if the string is empty
    if not words:
        return False
    # Check if the last character is a letter and not the last part of a word
    return len(words[-1]) > 0 and words[-1][-1].isalpha() and not words[-1][-1].isalpha(lambda x: x.isalpha())
```

The function splits the input string into words using whitespace characters as separators and then checks if the string is empty. If empty, it returns False as there are no words to check. Next, it checks if the last character of the last split word is a letter. If so, it further checks if it is the last character of the string and not part of a word. If both conditions are met, the function returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`. 

The unit tests for this function are commented out as you requested, and you can uncomment them to test the function accordingly. 
Here is an example of how to use this function:
```python
# Test the function
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie"))  # Expected: False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e"))  # Expected: True
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e "))  # Expected: False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(""))  # Expected: False
```
