```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    """
    Create a function that returns True if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and False otherwise.

    Parameters:
        txt (str): The input string to be evaluated.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, False otherwise.
    """
    # Extracting the last character and removing whitespace
    last_char = txt.strip()[-1:]
    
    # Checking if the last character is a letter and not part of a word
    return (last_char.isalpha() and 
            last_char not in txt.split())
```
The provided solution utilizes the `isalpha()` method to check if the last character is an alphabetical character and the `split()` method to examine whether the last character is not part of a 'word' in the given text. The function ultimately returns `True` if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is an example usage of the function with some test cases:
```python
# Test the function with some examples
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie"))  # Expected output: False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e"))  # Expected output: True
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e "))  # Expected output: False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(""))  # Expected output: False
```

The expected output for the test cases is:
```
False
True
False
False
``` 
The function checks the last character of the string, ignoring any leading or trailing whitespace. It returns `True` if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of any complete word in the string, and `False` otherwise.
