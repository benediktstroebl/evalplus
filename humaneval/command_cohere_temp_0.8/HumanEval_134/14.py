The provided solution adheres to the problem's requirements. It first splits the input string into individual words using whitespace characters as separators. It then retrieves the last character of the last word and checks if it's an alphabetical character using the `str.isalpha()` method. Additionally, it verifies if the last character is not part of any word in the input string by comparing it with the last character of each word. The function returns `True` if the last character is an alphabetical character and isn't part of a word, and `False` otherwise.

Note that the function intelligently handles edge cases, such as when the input string is empty or when there are no words in the string, ensuring it provides the correct result for all scenarios.
