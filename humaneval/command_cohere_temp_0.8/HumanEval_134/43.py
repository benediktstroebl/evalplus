The problem synopsis and solution are as follows:
```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    """ ... """
```

This script defines a Python function named `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` that evaluates a given string `txt`. The goal is to determine if the very last character in the string is an alphabetical character that is not part of a word. In other words, it checks if the final character is an isolated letter (not part of a word) or not. The function returns `True` if this condition is met, and `False` otherwise. The function is aptly commented, and the syntax is concise and clear.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("Hello World"))  # False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("Hello World!"))  # True
``` 

The first statement prints `False` since the last character in the string `"Hello World"` is not an isolated letter. The second statement prints `True` since the last character in the string `"Hello World!"` is an exclamation mark which is an isolated letter.
