This script provides a function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` that assesses the last character of any given input string and determines whether it is an alphabetical character not included in a word. To achieve this, the function incorporates a subsidiary function `is_last_char_not_part_of_word`, utilizing it to ascertain whether the final character is constituted by a space or a letter not bound within a word. Ultimately, the primary function validates these assessments against pertinent examples outlined in the problem's description, ultimately yielding a boolean output.
