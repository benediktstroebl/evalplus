The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` works by first creating a new string that is the same as the input string (`txt`) except it does not end with the last character. It does this using Python's array slicing syntax (`txt[:-1]`), which removes the last character from the string. Then, the function checks this new string (`prev_txt`) to see if it ends with any of a variety of punctuation marks or whitespace characters. If it does, this means the last character is not part of a word in the string, and the function returns True. If none of these are true, then the function checks if the last character itself is an alphabetical character, and if so, it returns True. If neither of these conditions is true, it returns False. This method is efficient and easy to understand.
