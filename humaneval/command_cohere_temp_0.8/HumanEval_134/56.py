This Python script defines a function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` that determines whether the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word. It returns `True` if these conditions are met and `False` otherwise. This function is helpful when you need to validate if a character is isolated and alphabetic, excluding the possibility that it's part of a word. 

The script also incorporates a test suite to confirm the function's correctness against various scenarios outlined in the original problem. You can use these tests to verify the function's behavior against specific inputs, ensuring it behaves as expected. 

You can call the `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` function with a string as an argument to determine whether the last character meets the specified criteria. For example:
```python
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("abc def ghi"))  # Output: False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("abc def ghi jkl"))  # Output: True
``` 

This will evaluate the last character's eligibility against the defined rules.
