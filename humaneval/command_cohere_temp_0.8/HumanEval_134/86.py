    Create a function that returns True if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and False otherwise.

    Parameters:
    txt (str): The input string to be evaluated.

    bool: True if the last character is an alphabetical character not part of a word, False otherwise.

    Examples:

    >>> check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e")
    True

```

The function utilizes the `re` module and regular expressions to check whether the last character of the input string `txt` is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word. In detail, the function checks if the last character is either:
1. Not surrounded by any whitespace characters, in which case it is considered part of a word if it is surrounded by alphabetical and numerical characters only (i.e. a word character).
2. Surrounded by whitespace characters, in which case it is considered not part of a word if it is an alphabetical character.

The function then returns the corresponding boolean evaluation of these conditions. The given examples in the prompt return the following results:
- `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie")` returns `False`.
- `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e")` returns `True`.
- `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e ")` returns `False`.
- `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("")` returns `False`. 

This script passes the provided self-contained test cases as it correctly evaluates the last character based on the given constraints.  It returns `True` if the last character is an alphabetical character not part of a word, and `False` otherwise. 
If you run this script in a Python environment, it will return the specified results of the test cases as outlined in the examples. 
Please let me know if you have any additional questions or requests related to the given Python script. 
It will be my pleasure to assist you further!
