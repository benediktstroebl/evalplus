```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    """
    Create a function that returns True if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        txt (str): The input string to analyze.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, False otherwise.
    """
    # Define the string
    assert isinstance(txt, str), "Input must be a string"
    # Split the string into words
    words = txt.split()
    # Check if the string is empty
    if not words:
        return False
    # Get the last character
    last_char = words[-1][-1]
    # Check if the last character is a letter and is not part of a word
    return (last_char.isalpha() and 
            last_char not in ' '.join(words).lower())
```

The function splits the input string into individual words and then checks if the last character is an alphabetical character, considering both uppercase and lowercase. Additionally, it ensures that the last character is not part of any word in the given string. The function handles the edge case of an empty input string gracefully and returns False, as specified in the problem statement.
