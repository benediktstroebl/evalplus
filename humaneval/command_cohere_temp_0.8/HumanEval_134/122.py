    Create a function that returns True if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        txt (str): The input string to analyze.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the last character is an alphabetical character not part of a word, False otherwise.
    """
    # Define the string
    assert isinstance(txt, str), "Input 'txt' must be a string."

    # Check if the string is empty
    if not txt:
        return False

    # Remove trailing spaces (if any) as they shouldn't be considered as part of a word
    txt = txt.rstrip()

    # Check if the last character is a letter and not the last character of a word
    return txt[-1].isalpha() and not txt.rsplit(' ', 1)[-1].isalpha()
```

The function uses string manipulation and Python's string-handling methods like `isalpha()` and `rstrip()` to determine whether the last character is a letter and is not part of a word. It trims any trailing spaces and then checks if the last character is alphabetical. If it is, the function checks if that character is the last character of the entire string and not part of a word. The function returns `True` if these conditions are met and `False` otherwise. It also provides informative docstrings and checks for potential invalid inputs, ensuring better code robustness.
