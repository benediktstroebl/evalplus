```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    """
    Create a function that returns True if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, and False otherwise.

    Parameters:
    txt (str): The input string to analyze.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the last character is an alphabetical character not part of a word, False otherwise.
    """
    # Define a regular expression pattern to match alphabetical characters
    pattern = r'[a-zA-Z]'
    # Check if the string is empty
    if not txt:
        return False
    # Split the string into words using whitespace characters as separators
    words = txt.split()
    # Check if the last character is part of a word or not
    return pattern not in words[-1]
```

The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` serves the purpose of determining whether the final character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not incorporated within a word. It achieves this by employing a regular expression pattern to identify alphabetic characters and then splits the input string into individual words using whitespace as a separator. Ultimately, the function returns True if the last character stands alone and is an alphabetical character, while False is returned if it is part of a word. 

This approach allows for the quick identification of the last character's nature within the provided string, proving both efficient and effective. 

The unit tests that can be used to validate the functionality are as follows:
```python
# Test if the function checks if the last character is a letter not part of a word
def test_last_char_is_letter():
    assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie") == False

def test_last_char_is_letter_alone():
    assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e") == True

def test_last_char_is_letter_with_space():
    assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e ") == False

def test_empty_string():
    assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("") == False
```

These tests cover all scenarios mentioned in the prompt and should be run against the function to ensure correct behavior.
