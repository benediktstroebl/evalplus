The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` serves the purpose of identifying whether the final character of a given string is an alphabetical character and isn't a part of any word. It accepts a single argument, `txt`, which is expected to be a string. To accommodate potential trailing spaces, it removes them. Subsequently, the function conducts a dual check: it verifies if the last character is an alphabetic character through the `isalpha()` method and whether the last character is separate from its containing word, by using the `split(" ")` method. The function returns `True` if the criteria are met, and `False` otherwise. 

The developer has included a test suite to validate the function's operation, checking for a variety of scenarios such as empty strings, cases where the last character is a letter but is part of a word, and instances where the last character is both a letter and isn't part of a word. The tests are included within the function, using the `assert` statement. If the condition specified in the `assert` statement is `True`, the test passes. Otherwise, the test fails, producing an error message to outline the conditions that led to the failure. 

To summarize, the code provides a solution to the problem statement with the aid of a well-crafted function and a comprehensive test suite to ensure its correct behavior under various scenarios.
