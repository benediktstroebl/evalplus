This code defines a function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` that evaluates the last character of a given string without considering any whitespace at the end of the string. 

The test suite checks the following scenarios:
- **Empty String**: Ensures the function returns `False` when the input string is empty.
- **Last Character Is a Letter**: Returns `True` when the last character of the string is a letter and is not part of any word.
- **Last Character Is a Letter in a Word**: Returns `False` when the last character is part of a word.
- **Last Character Is a Non-Letter**: Returns `False` when the last character is not a letter.

The code asserts that the input is a string and proceeds to check if the last character of the string, excluding any trailing whitespace, is an alphabetical character with the `alpha` variable. The `alphabetical_characters` list contains all uppercase and lowercase letters.
