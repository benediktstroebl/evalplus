``` 

The problem asks us to create a function that returns `True` if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word (i.e., the last character is a letter that is not enclosed within a word, perhaps at the end of the string or possibly standing alone somewhere in the middle). Otherwise, it should return `False`.

We first split the input string into a list of words using whitespace characters as separators. If the string is empty or consists only of whitespace characters and no alphanumeric characters (i.e., normal readable characters), we return `False`. Otherwise, we check if the last character is an alphabetical character and not the last character of one of the words (i.e., it's a standalone letter or the last character of the string).

This problem can be tricky because of the complexity of parsing strings and understanding what constitutes a "word." However, the above solution provides a straightforward way to approach this problem in Python.
