```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if set(s) & set(letters) else s[::-1]
```
This Python script defines a function `solve` that takes a single argument, `s`, representing a given string. This function performs two distinct actions based on the characters in the string.

1. If any letter characters (both uppercase and lowercase) are present in the string `s`, the `swapcase()` method is applied to reverse the case of each letter while leaving non-letter characters unchanged. This is achieved through the condition `set(s) & set(letters)`, which checks if there are common elements between the set of characters in `s` and the set of letters (both uppercase and lowercase).
2. If the string `s` contains no letter characters, it means the string is composed solely of non-letter characters or is empty. In this case, the function uses the slicing operation `s[::-1]` to reverse the entire string.

This solution covers all scenarios described in the problem statement and should produce the desired results based on whether letter characters are present in the input string.
