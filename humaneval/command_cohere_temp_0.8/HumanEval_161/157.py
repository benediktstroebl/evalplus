```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if set(s) & set(letters) else s[::-1]
```
The function `solve` takes a string `s` as input and processes each character of the string as follows:
1. It checks if the character is a letter using the Python set membership evaluation set(s) & set(letters).
2. If the character is a letter, it decides whether to swap the case or keep the character as is based on the character's current case. If the character is in upper case, it swaps to lower case and vice versa. This is achieved using the swapcase() function.
3. If the character is not a letter, it keeps the character as is.
4. Finally, it returns the resulting string. 

This algorithm ensures that letters are flipped case-wise if they are letters, or the entire string is reversed if it contains no letters. As per the problem statement, the solution also maintains the integrity of non-letter characters. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, and a space complexity of O(1). 

The `swapcase()` function in Python swaps the case of each character in a string. For example, it transforms 'Hello' into 'hELLO'. It is a built-in function that doesn't require any additional modules and is efficient with a time complexity of O(n).
