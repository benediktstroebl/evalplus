```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if set(s) & set(letters) else s[::-1]
```
This Python script defines a function `solve` that takes a string `s` as input and performs the following steps to solve the specified problem:

It uses the `swapcase` method, which toggles the case of each letter in the string. This method is part of the Python string module and is a built-in way to reverse the case of letters, ensuring that non-letter characters are kept as they are.

However, if the input string does not contain any letters, it instead uses the slicing technique `s[::-1]` to reverse the entire string. The `s[::-1]` slicing reverses the string by taking all the elements of the string and making them the last elements of the new string, and then taking the rest of the empty string as the new beginning, effectively flipping the string.

The code ensures that the case of letters is correctly reversed while keeping non-letter characters unchanged, and it efficiently handles strings of any composition, including those with no letters.
