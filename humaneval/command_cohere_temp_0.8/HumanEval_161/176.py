```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if len(s) == 0 or set(s).isdisjoint(letters) else ''.join(c.swapcase() if c in letters else c for c in s)
```
This code defines a function `solve` taking one argument `s`, which performs the task as stated in the problem statement. It uses `swapcase()` to flip case if there are no letters in the string or no letters in the string whose characters are to be flipped, and manually flips the case for letters otherwise. It then returns the resulting string.
