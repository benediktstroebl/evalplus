```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if set(s) & set(letters) else s[::-1]
```
This Python script defines a function `solve` that takes a string `s` as input and performs the following steps:

```
1. Checks if any characters in the string `s` are letters (uppercase or lowercase) by comparing them to the string `letters` which contains all letters. This is done using the set intersection operation (`set(s) & set(letters)`).
2. If any letters are found in `s`, it calls the `swapcase()` method on the string, which swaps the case of each letter. This ensures that any lowercase letters become uppercase and vice versa.
3. If no letters are found in `s`, it uses the slicing operation `s[::-1]` to reverse the entire string. This is done by taking each character in the string and placing it in the opposite position, effectively reversing the string.
``` 

The script ensures that the function follows the problem's guidelines by reversing letter characters and leaving non-letter characters unchanged.
