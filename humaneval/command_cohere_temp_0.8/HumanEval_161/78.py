```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if len(set(s).intersection(letters)) == 0 else s.translate(str.maketrans(letters, letters[1:] + letters[:1]))
```
The code defines a function `solve` taking one argument `s`, which performs the following steps:
1. Checks if there are no letters in the string using the set method, and if there are no letters, returns the string with case swapped using the `swapcase` method.
2. If there are letters in the string, creates a translation table using `str.maketrans` where the first and second characters are swapped for each character in the string. Then, it uses the translate method on the string to swap cases for alphabetic characters, leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged.
