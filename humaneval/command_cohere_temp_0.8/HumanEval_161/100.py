```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if set(s) & set(letters) == set() else s.swapcase()[letters == 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz']
```
The function uses a few techniques to achieve the desired result:
1. It first checks if the string contains any letters using set membership and equivalence checking.
2. If the string has no letters, it simply uses the `swapcase()` method to reverse the string. This method does not distinguish between letters and other characters, and thus will return the same result as the problem statement's requirement for no letter cases.
3. If the string does contain letters, the `swapcase()` method is used, but only for the letters defined in the `letters` string. This effectively reverses the case of letters while keeping non-letter characters unchanged.
