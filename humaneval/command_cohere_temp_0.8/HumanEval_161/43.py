```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if set(s) & set(letters) == set() else s.translate(str.maketrans(letters, letters[::-1]))
```
The `swapcase` method is used for reversing the string when it contains no letters. In the case that the string contains letters, the `translate` method is utilized to reverse the letters while reversing the case. This is done by creating a translation table using `str.maketrans` that maps each letter to its reverse counterpart.
