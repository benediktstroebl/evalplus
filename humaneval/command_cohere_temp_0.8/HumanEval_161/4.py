```python
def solve(s):
    new_str = []
    for c in s:
        if c.isalpha():
            new_str.append(c.swapcase())
        else:
            new_str.append(c)
    return ''.join(new_str)
```

This code defines a function `solve` taking one parameter `s`, which performs the character transformations specified in the problem statement. It iterates through each character in the input string `s`. For alphabetic characters, it uses the `swapcase` method to reverse their case, adding the modified character to the `new_str` list. Non-alphabetic characters are added to `new_str` as-is. Finally, the function joins the modified characters back into a string and returns the result.

The code is self-contained and solves the problem described in the markdown code block. 

This code can be simplified using the `str.format` method:
```python
def solve(s):
    return ''.join(c.swapcase() if c.isalpha() else c for c in s)
```

And further optimized using list comprehension and the `str.join` method:
```python
def solve(s):
    return ''.join(c.swapcase() for c in s if c.isalpha()) + ''.join(c for c in s if not c.isalpha())
``` 
The latter code is more concise but still achieves the same result, reversing the case for alphabetic characters while leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged and then concatenating the strings together.
