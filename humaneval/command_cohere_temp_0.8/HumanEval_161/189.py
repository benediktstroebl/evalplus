```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if set(s) & set(letters) else s[::-1]
```
The function `solve` takes a string as input and first checks if the string contains any letters, it uses the string `letters` to generate a set of all letters which is then used to check if any character in the input string is a letter. If there are no letters in the string, the function returns the input string reversed using `[::-1]` slicing. If there is at least one letter in the string, the case of each letter is swapped using the `swapcase()` method.
