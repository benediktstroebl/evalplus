```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if set(s) & set(letters) else s[::-1]
```
This Python script defines a function `solve` that takes a single argument `s`, which is the input string. 

Here's an explanation of the code:
- The set `letters` stores all uppercase and lowercase letters from a to z.
- The `swapcase()` function is used to convert the case of each letter in the string. This function works by checking if the character is alphanumeric or not. If it is, it is transformed to its opposite case (upper to lower or vice versa). However, if the character is not alphanumeric, it is kept as it is.
- The `set()` method is used to check if the set of characters in the input string `s` intersects (has common elements) with the set of letters. If there are no common characters, it means the string is made up of non-alphabetical characters, and the `swapcase()` function would do nothing. In this case, the code returns s[::-1], which is the same as `s[::-1]`, reversing the positions of the characters in the string, effectively reversing the string.

The script will reverse the input string if it contains no letters, and otherwise, it will convert each letter to its opposite case while leaving non-letter characters unchanged.
