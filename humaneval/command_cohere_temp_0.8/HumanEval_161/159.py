```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if set(s) & set(letters) else s[::-1]
```
This Python script defines a function `solve` that takes a string `s` as input and performs the following steps: 

1. It checks if any characters in the string `s` are letters using the set intersection operation &= which returns a new set of unique elements that are present in both sets. 

2. If there are no letter characters, it means the string shouldn't be flipped case, so it returns the reversed string using slicing s[::-1]. 

3. If there are letter characters, it uses the `swapcase` method to swap the case of each letter character. 

The `solve` function accordingly reverses the string if there are no letter characters in the string, or flips the case of letters, while keeping non-letter characters unchanged. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the input string s since both the set intersection and the `swapcase` methods operate in O(n) time. 

The space complexity is also O(n) due to the creation of the new set in the check, however, this can be reduced by updating the input set instead of creating a new one and doing the intersection.
