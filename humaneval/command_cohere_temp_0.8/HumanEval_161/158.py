```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if set(s) & set(letters) else s[::-1]
```
The function uses two sets:
1. `set(s)` to check for characters in the string s.
2. `set(letters)` to check for the presence of letters that should be reversed.

Then it uses the `swapcase()` method if there are characters in Set1 that are also in Set2. The `swapcase()` method is used to change the case of alphabetic characters in a string. The term `set()` is used here as a function that creates a set, and the & operator is used to check if the two sets have common elements (characters in this context).

If the string doesn't contain any letters, it proceeds to use the `s[::-1]` slice which reverses the order of the characters in the string. The slice notation, in this case, is used to reverse the string since the negative value -1 indicates the last index of the string, and the fact that the indices are backwards indicates a reverse order. 

This solves the problem as outlined in the prompt.
