```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if len(s) == len(set(s)) else s[::-1]
```
This Python script defines a function `solve` taking one argument, `s`, and returns a string. The function evaluates whether or not there are any letter characters within the string, utilizing the `set()` method to eliminate duplicate characters and measure the length to check if the character set has the same length as the entire string. If there are no letter characters, the function utilizes the `swapcase()` method, reversing the case of each letter. If there are letter characters, the function uses the `swapcase()` method, reversing the case of each letter. Ultimately, the function returns the altered string.
