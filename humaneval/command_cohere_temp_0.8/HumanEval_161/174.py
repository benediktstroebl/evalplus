```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if set(s) & set(letters) else s[::-1]
```
This Python script defines a function `solve` that takes a single argument, `s`, which is the input string. Inside the function, it checks if any characters in the string are letters using the set intersection operation (&). If there are no letter characters, it means the string should be reversed entirely. It uses the slicing notation [::-1] to reverse the string. If there are letter characters, it uses the swapcase method to change the case of letters alternately. The function then returns the modified string.
