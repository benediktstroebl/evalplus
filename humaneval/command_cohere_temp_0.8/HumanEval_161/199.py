```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if set(s) & set(letters) else s[::-1]
```
The function leverages the string method `swapcase()` to reverse the case of letters present in the string. Whereas, for non-letter characters, it uses the slicing technique `s[::-1]` to reverse the entire string. This approach ensures clean and concise code while adhering to the problem guidelines.
