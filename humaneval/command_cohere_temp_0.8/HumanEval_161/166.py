```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if len(s) == 0 or set(s) & set(letters) == set() else ''.join(c.swapcase() if c in letters else c for c in s)
```
This Python script defines a function `solve` that takes a string `s` as input and processes it in the manner specified by the problem statement. Here's how it works:
1. The `letters` string contains all lowercase and uppercase letters, effectively serving as a checkpoint for whether a character is alphanumeric or not.
2. The `swapcase()` function is an efficient way to flip the case of letters while leaving non-letters unchanged. This is utilized for strings that contain no letters or are entirely numeric.
3. For strings that have both letters and non-letters (alphanumeric strings), we use a list comprehension to individually process each character. For letters, we swap their case, while for non-letters, we keep them as they are.
4. The final result is a string that undergoes the stipulated transformations on the input string `s`.
