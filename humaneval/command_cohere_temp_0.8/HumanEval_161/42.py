```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if set(s) & set(letters) else s[::-1]
```
This Python script defines a function `solve` taking one argument `s`, which performs the transformations as required by the problem statement. Here's how it works:
1. The `letters` string contains all lowercase and uppercase letters, used to determine if the input string contains any letters.
2. The `swapcase()` method is applied to `s` if any letter in `s` has its case swapped. This method efficiently swaps the case of each character, making the lowercase letters uppercase and the uppercase letters lowercase. However, non-alphabetic characters are unaffected.
3. If the set of characters in the string `s` does not overlap with the set of letters ('letters'), then the string is reversed using slicing (`s[::-1]`). This is a more efficient way to reverse a string than using the built-in `reverse` method, and it works by taking alternating slices from the end and start of the string until it constructs the entire reversed result.

The given example in the problem statement passes since the function `solve` has been written to handle them correctly:
```python
print(solve("1234")) # Outputs: "4321"
print(solve("ab"))  # Outputs: "AB"
print(solve("#a@C"))  # Outputs: "#A@c"
``` 

This code will output:
```
4321
AB
#A@c
```

The script passes the specified tests and solves the problem accordingly.
