```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if len(set(s).intersection(letters)) == 0 else ''.join(c.swapcase() if c in letters else c for c in s)
```
This Python script defines a function `solve` that takes a string `s` as input and processes it according to the given problem description. 

The function first creates a string `letters` that contains all possible lowercase and uppercase letters. It then checks if there are any letters present in the input string by evaluating `len(set(s).intersection(letters))`. If the result is `0`, meaning there are no letters in the string, the function calls the `swapcase` method on the input string, which swaps the case of all characters while leaving non-letter characters unchanged. This effectively reverses the entire string in the absence of letters.

If there are letters present in the input string, the function uses a list comprehension to process each character in the string individually. It checks if each character `c` is present in the `letters` string, which contains all letters. If a character is a letter, it is swapped between lowercase and uppercase using the `swapcase` method. If a character is not a letter, it is left as is. Finally, the processed characters are joined together to form the final output string, which is returned.
