```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if len(s) != len(set(s) & set(letters)) else s[::-1]
```
This Python script defines a function `solve` that takes a string `s` as input and performs the following steps to solve the specified problem:

It checks if any character in the string is a letter by using the `set` and `intersection` methods to find the characters that are not in the alphabet. The length of the string and the length of the unique alphabet characters are compared to determine if any character is a letter. If there are no letters in the string, it means the characters must be numbers, special characters, or spaces, so the string is reversed using `s[::-1]` . This means that the first character is swapped with the last, the second with the second last, and so on, effectively reversing the string. 

If any letter character is found, the case is swapped using the `swapcase` method. This will reverse the case of letters while leaving non-letter characters unchanged. 

The function returns the resulting string after applying the appropriate reversal logic based on the presence of letter characters in the string.
