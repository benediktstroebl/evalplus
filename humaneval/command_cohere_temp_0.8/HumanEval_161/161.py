```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if len(s) == 0 or all(c not in letters for c in s) else ''.join(c.swapcase() if c in letters else c for c in s)
```
This Python script defines a function `solve` that takes a single string argument `s`. This function performs two actions based on the characters in the string and its length:
1. Swapcase: If the string `s` is empty or contains only non-alphabetic characters (as determined by the `all` function in conjunction with a generator expression), it is assumed that the desired behavior is to reverse the string. This is done using the `swapcase` method, which swaps the case of alphabetic characters while leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged. This is a built-in method for strings in Python 2 and Python 3.
2. Custom Swapcase: If the string contains at least one alphabetic character, the function will iterate through each character in the string and apply a custom swapping logic. If the character is alphabetic (i.e., present in the string `letters` that contains all possible alphabetic characters), it will be swapped between upper and lower case. If the character is not alphabetic, it will be left unchanged.

This behavior is described in the docstring, which is used to define the function:
```python
def solve(s):
    """
    You are given a string s.
    If s[i] is a letter, reverse its case from lower to upper or vise versa, 
    otherwise keep it as it is.
    If the string contains no letters, reverse the string.
    The function should return the resulted string.
    Examples:
    solve("1234") = "4321"
    solve("ab") = "AB"
    solve("#a@C") = "#A@c"
    """
```
This script provides a direct and efficient solution to the problem, with no external dependencies, and should run correctly for any string input.
