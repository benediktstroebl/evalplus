```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if set(s) & set(letters) else s[::-1]
```
This Python script defines a function `solve` taking one argument `s`, which performs the transformations outlined in the problem statement. Here's how it works:
1. The `letters` string contains all lowercase and uppercase letters, used to determine if the input string `s` contains any letters.
2. The `swapcase()` method is applied to `s` if it contains at least one letter. This method swaps the case of each letter in the string. For example, it converts lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa.
3. If the set of characters in `s` does not intersect with the set of letters (`set(letters)`), there are no letters in `s`. In this case, the `s[::-1]` operation reverses the entire string.

The given example tests demonstrate its functionality on different input scenarios.
