```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if set(s) & set(letters) == set() else s.swapcase()[letters == 'a']
```
The function takes a string and checks if it contains any letters. If the string contains no letters, it swaps the characters of the string case, using the `swapcase()` method. If the string contains at least one letter, it swaps only the letter characters case, using the `swapcase()` method and a character check beforehand. This is done using the `letters` string, which contains all possible letter characters once, and the `set()` and `&` operations to check if the set of characters in the string `s` is a subset of the characters in the `letters` string.
