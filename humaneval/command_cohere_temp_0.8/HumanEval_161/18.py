```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if len(s) == len(set(s)) else s[::-1]
```
This code defines a function `solve` taking one parameter `s`, which performs the following steps:

1. Checks if any character in the string is a letter, by checking if the set of characters in the string has the same length as the string itself.
2. Uses the `swapcase()` method to swap the case of characters in the string, if there are no letters in the string.
3. Otherwise, uses the slicing operation `s[::-1]` to reverse the order of characters within the string.

The `swapcase()` method is used for swapping the case of characters in a string. This method operates character-by-character, switching each character to its uppercase or lowercase alternative as necessary to give the original case to the other type of character. For example, if the string passed to `swapcase()` is 'hiTHERE', the output will be 'hiTHERE'. This is because the method swaps the case of each character independently, so the result is 'HIthere'.
