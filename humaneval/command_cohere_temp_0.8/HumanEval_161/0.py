```python
def solve(s):
    return ''.join(c.swapcase() if c.isalpha() else c for c in s)
```
This Python script defines a function `solve` taking one parameter `s` which performs the character swap case if a character is alphabetical or keeps it unchanged if it's a special character. The function concatenates the modified characters to produce the required result. In the example provided, this would be the exact behavior needed to solve the challenge and therefore produce the desired output for the test cases.
