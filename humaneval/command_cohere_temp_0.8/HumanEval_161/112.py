```python
def solve(s):
    return ''.join(c.swapcase() if c.isalpha() else c for c in s)
```
This Python script defines a function `solve` taking one parameter `s`, where based on the given string's characters, it either swaps the case of alphabetic characters or retains the original form for non-alphabetic characters, and subsequently returns the resulting string by concatenating these processed characters. 

The `swapcase` method is utilized to alter the case of alphabetic characters, effectively reversing their case while keeping non-alphabetic characters unchanged. 

This approach enhances code readability and simplifies the implementation of the problem's desired behavior. It directly interacts with the provided example in the comment and produces accurate results. The solve function's behavior aligns with the problem's statement, promoting a concise and effective solution.
