```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if len(s) != len(set(s) & set(letters)) else s[::-1]
```
This Python script defines a function `solve` taking one argument, a string `s`. The function operates differently depending on the character distribution in the input string. If the string contains a mix of letters and non-letters, the swapcase() method is applied to reverse the case of each letter while keeping non-letter characters unchanged. This is achieved by checking if the length of the input string is not equal to the length of the set of unique characters in the string that are also present in the alphabet. If the condition is met, the string is reversed using the s[::-1] slicing operation. This ensures that the result is a string where letters with uppercase characters are reversed while non-letter characters remain the same.
