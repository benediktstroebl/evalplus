```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if len(set(s).intersection(letters)) == 0 else s.swapcase() if s.isalpha() else s
```
The code defines a function `solve` taking one parameter `s` which is the input string. If the string contains no letters, it swaps the characters of the string using `swapcase` and returns it. If the string contains letters, it checks if each character is a letter using the `isalpha` method, and swaps its case accordingly. The `swapcase` function swaps the case of letters and leaves non-letters as they are, achieving the desired result as described in the problem statement.
