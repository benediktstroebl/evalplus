```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if set(s) & set(letters) else s[::-1]
```
This Python script defines a function `solve` that takes a string `s` as input and performs the following steps:
1. Checks if any characters in the string `s` are letters using the set method. This determination of whether a string contains any letters is performed using the Python operation `set(s) & set(letters)`. Here, `set(s)` converts the string `s` into a set of its characters, and `set(letters)` creates a set of all lowercase and uppercase letters. The logical operation `&` performs an element-wise intersection, effectively checking if any characters from `s` are also present in the set of letters.
2. Uses the `swapcase()` method to convert the string `s` to a case-reversed version of itself if there are letters in the string. This method works by converting lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa.
3. If there are no letters in the string, meaning that the condition above is false, it uses the slicing operation `s[::-1]` to reverse the entire string. This slicing notation achieves this by taking each character in the string in reverse order.

The script's function solve solves the problem as stated in the markdown code block in the original request. It ensures that letters in the string are reversed in their case while non-letter characters are not altered. The reversed string is then returned. 

This code will work correctly for the provided examples in the description:
- `solve("1234")` returns `"4321"` 
- `solve("ab")` returns `"AB"`
- `solve("#a@C")` returns `"#A@c"`

It accurately follows the specification of the problem.
