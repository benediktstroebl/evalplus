```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if set(s) & set(letters) else s[::-1]
```
This Python script defines a function `solve` taking one argument `s`, which performs the following:
1. It creates a string `letters` containing all letters in lower and upper case to be used in a bitwise `&` operation for checking if a string contains any letter.
2. It uses the `swapcase()` method if any letter is found in the string, which swaps the case of each letter.
3. If no letters are found in the string it uses the slice operator `[::-1]` to reverse the entire string.

The script ensures the problem's requirement of returning the modified string is met, as explained above.
