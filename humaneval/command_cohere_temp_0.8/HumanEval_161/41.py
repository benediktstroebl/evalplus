```python
def solve(s):
    return ''.join(c.swapcase() if c.isalpha() else c for c in s)
```
This Python script defines a function `solve` taking a single string argument `s`, where it processes each character in the string through a conditional check utilizing Python's `isalpha()` method. When a character is alphabetic, the `swapcase()` method is used to interchange its case, effectively toggling between upper and lower cases. Conversely, if a character is non-alphabetic, it's kept as is, unaffected by the case reversal. The `join()` method is then applied to concatenate all the processed characters back into a single string, which is returned as the output. 

The `solve()` function effectively accomplishes the problem's requirement of reversing the string's characters in case while disregarding non-alphabetic characters.
