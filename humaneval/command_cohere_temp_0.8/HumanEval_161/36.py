```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if set(s) & set(letters) else s[::-1]
```
This Python script defines a function `solve` that takes a single argument `s`, which is the input string. 

The function works as follows:
1. It checks if any letter characters (both uppercase and lowercase) are present in the input string using the set membership operator (`set(s) & set(letters)`).
2. If any letter characters are present, the function uses the `swapcase()` method to convert lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa. This effectively flips the case of letter characters while leaving non-letter characters unchanged.
3. If no letter characters are present in the input string, the function uses slicing (`s[::-1]`) to reverse the entire string.

Therefore, this code solves the problem by flipping the case of letter characters while keeping non-letter characters unchanged and reversing the entire string if it contains no letters.

This function can be directly invoked with test strings to validate its behavior:
```python
print(solve("1234"))  # Output: "4321"
print(solve("ab"))  # Output: "AB"
print(solve("#a@C"))  # Output: "#A@c"
```
