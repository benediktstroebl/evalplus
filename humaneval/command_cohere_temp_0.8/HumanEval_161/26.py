```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if len(s) != len(set(s)) or not s.isalpha() else ''.join(c.swapcase() if c in letters else c for c in s)
```
This Python script defines a function `solve` that takes a single argument, `s`, representing a string. This function performs different operations based on the characteristics of the input string:
1. If the length of the string is not unique, meaning it contains duplicate characters, or the string contains no letters ('alpha characters'), it uses the `swapcase` function to reverse the entire string. This is a built-in Python function that swaps the case of alphabetic characters in a string.
2. If the string contains only letters with no duplicates, it goes through each character in the string and performs a case swap using the `swapcase` function if the character is a letter. If the character is not a letter, it remains unchanged. Then, all these processed characters are concatenated together to form the final result.
