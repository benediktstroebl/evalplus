```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if set(s) & set(letters) else s[::-1]
```
This Python script defines a function `solve` that takes a single argument `s`, which is the input string. 

The function uses two sets to efficiently check if any characters in the string `s` are letters (both uppercase and lowercase). It uses the set `letters`, which contains all letters (both cases), to check if any characters in `s` are letters and thus decide whether to use the `swapcase()` method or `s[::-1]` to reverse the string. The `set()` method is used to check if any characters in the string `s` are letters, and the `&` operator is used to perform a set intersection, checking which letters are in the string. 

If the set intersection is not empty (`set(s) & set(letters)`), the `swapcase()` method is used to reverse the case of letters in the string while keeping non-letter characters unchanged. 

If the set intersection is empty (`set(s) & set(letters)`), the string is reversed using slicing with `s[::-1]`. This reverses the positions of each character in the string. 

This approach ensures that the function works correctly for the given problem statement and passes the provided tests.
