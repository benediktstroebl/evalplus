```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if len(s) == 0 or set(s) & set(letters) == set() else ''.join(c.swapcase() if c in letters else c for c in s)
```
This code defines a function `solve` taking one argument `s`, which performs the task as described in the prompt. Here's how it works:
1. It defines a string `letters` that contains all letters both in lower and upper case to be used in the `swapcase` function and to check if any character matches that `set()` difference technique is used.
2. If the length of the string is zero, it means there are no characters, and the string is returned after using the `swapcase` that swaps all characters.
3. If the set of characters in the string does not have any common element with the `letters` string, it means none of the characters is a letter, and the same `swapcase` is used.
4. If none of the above conditions is satisfied, it means there are letters and others, so a list comprehension is used to iterate over all characters, and for letters, their case is swapped using `swapcase`, while keeping non-letter characters as they are.
