```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if len(s) == len(set(s)) else s[::-1]
```
The function `solve` takes a string as an input and first checks if there are any duplicate characters in the string using the set membership and length of the set of characters in the string. If there are no duplicates, the function proceeds to use the `swapcase` method to flip characters assuming they are letters. If there are duplicates, it assumes the string contains non-letter characters and reverses the entire string using slicing. This approach ensures the function works for all the scenarios described in the prompt.
