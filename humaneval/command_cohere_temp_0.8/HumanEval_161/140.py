```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if set(s) & set(letters) == set() else s.swapcase()[letters == 'a' or s[0].isalpha()]
```
The `swapcase()` function is utilized to alter the case of each letter in the string while leaving non-letter characters untouched. The condition `letters == 'a' or s[0].isalpha()` checks whether the first character of the string is a letter and assigns the appropriate case adjustment, 'a' for lower case or 'A' for upper case. This is done to avoid unnecessary adjustments when the string doesn't contain any letters.
