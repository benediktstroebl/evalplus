```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if set(s) & set(letters) else s[::-1]
```
The function `solve` takes a string as input and first checks if any letter-case-sensitive characters are present in the string by looking for its set intersection with the set of lowercase and uppercase letters. If there is no intersection, indicating there are no letter-case-sensitive characters, the function reverses the string using slicing. Otherwise, it uses the `swapcase()` method to reverse the case of letter characters while leaving non-letter characters unchanged.
