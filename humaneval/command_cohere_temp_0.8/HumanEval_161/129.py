```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if len(s) != len(set(s)) or not s.isalpha() else ''.join(c.swapcase() if c in letters else c for c in s)
```
This Python script defines a function `solve` that takes a single argument, `s`, representing a string. This function performs different operations based on the characteristics of the input string:
1. If the length of the string is not unique, meaning it has multiple occurrences of the same character, the function calls `swapcase()`. This function swaps the case of ASCII letters and leaves non-letter characters unchanged, effectively reversing the string.
2. If the string contains only letters, the function goes through each character in the string and performs a case swap using `swapcase()` if the character is in the string `letters`, which represents all lowercase and uppercase letters. If the character is not a letter, it is left unchanged. Ultimately, the function returns the modified string.
