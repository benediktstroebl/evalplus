```python
def solve(s):
    return ''.join(c.swapcase() if c.isalpha() else c for c in s)
```
This Python script defines a function `solve` taking one parameter `s`, where based on the given string's characters, it either swaps the case of alphabetic characters or retains the original form for non-alphabetic characters, and subsequently joins this altered sequence of characters back into a single string. 

Here's an example demonstrating this function:
```python
print(solve("abcd$@"))
```
The output will be:
```
AbCd$@
``` 

This showcases the feature that alphabetic characters undergo a case swap, while non-alphabetic characters are kept unchanged. 

This approach utilizes Python's `swapcase` method and an iterator context manager to iterate over each character in the input string `s`, determining whether it's alphabetic or not. 

This eliminates the need for an explicit loop structure and makes the code more concise and readable.
