```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if set(s) & set(letters) else s[::-1]
```
This Python script defines a function `solve` that takes a string `s` as input and performs the following steps:
1. Checks if any characters in the string `s` are letters using the set intersection operation "&" between the set of characters in the string and the set of all letters.
2. If any letters are found in `s`, it uses the `swapcase()` method to swap the case of each letter. This method converts all lowercase letters to uppercase and all uppercase letters to lowercase, effectively reversing their case while leaving non-letter characters unchanged.
3. If no letters are found in `s`, it uses the slice notation `[::-1]` to reverse the entire string.

This solution is concise and achieves the desired outcome as specified in the problem statement. It handles both scenarios of reversing letters and reversing the entire string if no letters are present.
