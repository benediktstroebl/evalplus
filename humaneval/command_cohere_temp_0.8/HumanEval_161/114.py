```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if len(set(s).intersection(letters)) == 0 else s.swapcase() if s.isalpha() else s
```
The code defines a function `solve` taking one argument `s`, a string which undergoes a series of transformations. Firstly, it checks if there are any letters in the string s using the set intersection method. If there are no letters i.e. the length of the intersection is 0, it uses the `swapcase` method on the string which swaps the case of the characters. This results in the letters flipping between lower and upper case and non-letter characters remaining the same. If there are letters present in the string, it checks if all characters are letters using the `isalpha` method. If it is only made up of letters, it again uses the `swapcase` method to flip all character cases. If the string contains non-letter characters it is returned as is. The function is self-contained as it does not require any external variables and fully satisfies the requirements of the provided markdown code block.
