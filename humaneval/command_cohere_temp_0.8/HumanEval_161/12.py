```python
def solve(s):
    return ''.join(c.swapcase() if c.isalpha() else c for c in s)
```
This Python script defines a function `solve` taking a single argument `s`, where `s` is a string that may or may not contain letters. The function operates on each character in the string individually. For each character, it checks if it is an alphabet letter using the `isalpha()` method. If it is, it uses the `swapcase()` method to change the case of the character. This method swaps the case of the character if it is alphabetic and leaves punctuation marks and other non-alphabetic characters unchanged. If the character is not an alphabet letter, it is included in the result string as is. Finally, the function joins the modified characters back to form a single string and returns it.
