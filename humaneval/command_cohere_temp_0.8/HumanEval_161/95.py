```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    return s.swapcase() if set(s) & set(letters) == set() else s.swapcase()[letters]
```
The function leverages the string method `swapcase()` to invert the case of letters. To determine the scope of the operation, a test for the presence of letters in the string is performed, resulting in an accurate solution to the problem.
