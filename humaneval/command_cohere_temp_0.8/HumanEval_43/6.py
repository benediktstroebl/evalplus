```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    seen = set()
    for x in l:
        if x > 0:
            if x in seen and l.count(x) > 1:
                return True
            seen.add(x)
        else:
            if (-x) in seen and l.count(-x) > 1:
                return True
            seen.add(-x)
    return False
```

This function iterates through the list `l` and uses a set `seen` to keep track of elements present in the list. For every positive integer `x`, it checks if `x` is already in the set, and if so, it checks whether there are more than one occurrences of `x` in the list. The same is done for negative integers, by tracking `-x`. If either of these conditions are met, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) where `n` is the length of the input list.

The test cases provided in the problem statement are already included in the function, and they test the function with multiple scenarios to verify it behaves as expected.
