```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    seen = set()
    for x in l:
        if x > 0:
            if x in seen and l.count(x) > 1:
                return True
            seen.add(x)
        else:
            if (-x) in seen and l.count(-x) > 1:
                return True
            seen.add(-x)
    return False
```

This function examines every possible pair in the list 'l' and uses a set 'seen' to keep track of integers and their negatives that have been previously encountered. Two different items are added to the set if their sum is zero. The function returns 'True' if there are any two distinct elements in the list whose sum is zero. Otherwise, it returns 'False'. 

Here is an example usage of the function with a markdown code block:
```python
>>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
False
>>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
False
>>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
False
>>> pairs_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7])
True
>>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1])
False
```
