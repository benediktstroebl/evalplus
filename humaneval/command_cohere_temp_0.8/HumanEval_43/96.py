```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    seen = set()
    for x in l:
        if x > 0:
            if x in seen and l.count(x) > 1:
                return True
            seen.add(x)
        else:
            if -x in seen and l.count(-x) > 1:
                return True
            seen.add(-x)
    return False
```

This function iterates through the list `l` and uses a set `seen` to keep track of elements present in the list. For every positive integer `x`, it checks if `x` is already in the set, and if so, it checks whether there are more than one occurrences of `x` in the list. If both conditions are met, it returns `True`. This is also done for negative versions of elements `(-x)` in case the list contains negative integers. The function returns `False` if no such pair is found. 

This solution is optimized for efficiency as it uses a set which has a O(1) time complexity for checks and insertions, and the overall time complexity of the function is O(N), where N is the length of the input list.
