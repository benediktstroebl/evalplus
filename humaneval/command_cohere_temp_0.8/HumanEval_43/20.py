```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    # iterate through all pairs with two distinct elements from the list
    for a, b in combinations(l, r=2):
        # check if the sum of the two elements is equal to zero
        if a + b == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This function uses a for loop to iterate over all pairs of distinct elements in the input list using the `combinations` function. It checks whether the sum of each pair of elements is equal to zero. If it finds one such pair, it immediately returns `True`. If it goes through the entire list without finding such a pair, it returns `False`. This solution has an exponential time complexity of O(n^2), since it checks all possible pairs in the list.

It should pass the same tests as the problem statement suggests, as it is a correct implementation of the function described there. For example:
```python
>>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
False
>>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
False
>>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
False
>>> pairs_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7])
True
>>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1])
False
```

The idea behind the algorithm is pretty straight-forward, which is why I wouldn't worry too much about efficiency for this particular problem. However, if it ever became a concern, sorting the list and then using a single pass to find the target value would be more efficient, albeit at the cost of a slight increase in complexity.
