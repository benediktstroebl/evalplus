```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    seen = set()
    for x in l:
        if x > 0:
            if x in seen and l.count(x) > 1:
                return True
            seen.add(x)
        else:
            if (-x) in seen and l.count(-x) > 1:
                return True
            seen.add(-x)
    return False
```

This function examines every element in the list. If the element is positive, it attempts to find another occurrence of that element in the list, but with a negative sign. This is done using the set seen to keep track of seen elements to avoid duplicate detection. It then checks if the count of the element is greater than one to qualify as a pair that sums up to zero. The function returns True if any such pair is found, and False otherwise. 

This approach takes advantage of the fact that sets in Python are implemented as dictionaries, which allows for constant-time lookups, additions, and deletions. 

Here is a test suite that can be used to verify the correctness of the function:
```python
def test_pairs_sum_to_zero():
    # Test cases with lists of integers
    assert pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]) == False
    assert pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]) == False
    assert pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]) == False
    assert pairs_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]) == True
    assert pairs_sum_to_zero([1]) == False

    # Test case with empty list
    assert pairs_sum_to_zero([]) == False

    # Test case with list containing only one element
    assert pairs_sum_to_zero([0]) == False

    # Test case with list containing float
    assert pairs_sum_to_zero([0.0]) == False

    # Test case with list containing complex values
    assert pairs_sum_to_zero([3 + 2j, -2 - 3j]) == True

test_pairs_sum_to_zero()
```

To execute the test cases, appropriate import statements would be required if any of the test cases require complex numbers, floats, or empty lists.
