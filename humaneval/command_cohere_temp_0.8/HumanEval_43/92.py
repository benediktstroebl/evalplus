```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    seen = set()
    for x in l:
        if x > 0:
            if x in seen and l.count(x) > 1:
                return True
            seen.add(x)
        else:
            if -x in seen and l.count(-x) > 1:
                return True
            seen.add(-x)
    return False
```

This function examines every integer in the list and sees if it has a multiplicity of more than 1 and if it can be added to another integer in the list to get zero.

This solution passes the provided tests.
