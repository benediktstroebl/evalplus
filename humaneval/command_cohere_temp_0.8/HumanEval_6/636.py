```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opener, closer in zip('(()', '))'):
        stack = [0]
        level = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == opener:
                stack.append(level)
                level += 1
            elif c == closer:
                level = stack.pop()
        result.append(level)
    return result
```

The approach employs a straightforward nested loop. It iterates through the characters of the input string `s` and counts the level of opening parentheses ('(') encountered, incrementing a stack whenever an opening parenthesis is seen. When a closing parenthesis ')' is encountered, the corresponding level is popped from the stack, representing the deepest nesting level of that group of parentheses. This process is repeated for each group of parentheses separated by spaces in the input string. The resulting list of deepest nesting levels for each group is then returned.
