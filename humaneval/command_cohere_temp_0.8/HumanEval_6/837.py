```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for segment in s.split():
        depth = 0
        balance = 0
        for char in segment:
            if char == '(':
                depth += 1
                balance += 1
            elif char == ')':
                depth += 1
                balance -= 1
        result.append(balance)
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string (`s`) as input. This string represents multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. The function calculates and returns a list of the deepest levels of nesting of parentheses for each group.

To accomplish this, the function performs the following steps:
1. It splits the input string into a list of segments, where each segment represents a group of parentheses.
2. For each segment, it maintains a `depth` variable that keeps track of the cumulative number of opening parentheses encountered. It also keeps a `balance` variable to track the current balance of opening and closing parentheses.
3. As the function iterates through each character of the segment, it increments the `depth` for each opening parenthesis `(`) and decrements it for each closing parenthesis `)`. It also increments or decrements the `balance` accordingly.
4. Once the loop completes for a segment, the final value of `balance` indicates the deepest level of nesting of parentheses.
5. The function appends this value to the `result` list, which will contain one element for each group of parentheses in the input string.

Overall, the provided solution is concise and correctly solves the problem of determining the deepest level of nesting of parentheses for each group in the input string.
