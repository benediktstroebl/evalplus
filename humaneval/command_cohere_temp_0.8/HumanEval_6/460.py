```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(lambda x: list(zip(x, x[1:])), s.split())))) for _ in range(len(s.split()))]
```

The provided Python script demonstrates a function called `parse_nested_parens`, which takes a single argument, a string named `s`, and returns a list of integers. This function is designed to solve a specific problem involving nested parentheses.

The purpose of this function is to parse a given string that represents multiple groups of nested parentheses, separated by spaces, and determine the deepest level of nesting for each group. The result is a list where each element represents the maximum depth of nesting for the respective group.

The function uses a combination of list comprehensions, `zip`, and `max` operations to efficiently calculate the maximum depth of nesting. It iterates through the characters of the input string, leveraging `zip` to pair each opening parenthesis with its matching closing parenthesis. The `max` operation is then applied to the result of `i // 2`, where `i` is the length of each pair, to determine the maximum depth of nesting for each group.

To accommodate multiple groups in the input string, the function further splits the result list into individual elements using `s.split()`, ensuring that the result list has the same length as the input string, with each element representing the deepest level of nesting for the corresponding group.

This code exemplifies clean and efficient Python coding practices, utilizing built-in functions like `zip`, list comprehensions, and reducing operations to achieve the desired result. The function is well-documented, making it easy to understand and adaptable to diverse scenarios involving nested parentheses.
