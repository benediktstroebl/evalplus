```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for chunk in s.split():
        stack = []
        for c in chunk:
            if c == '(':
                stack.append(c)
            else:
                stack.pop()
        result.append(len(stack))
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens`, which takes a string input `s` representing multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces. This function calculates and returns a list of the deepest levels of nesting of parentheses for each group.

Here is an example of how to use this function, along with its explanation:
```python
>>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
[2, 3, 1, 3]
```

This function uses the splitting behavior of strings in Python to split the input string `s` into a list of substrings, where each substring represents a group of parentheses. It then iterates through each substring (chunk) using a loop.

For each chunk, it initializes an empty stack (similar to a stack of plates or a stack of books, where the last item inserted is the first item retrieved). As the loop iterates through each character of the chunk, it pushes an open parenthesis `(`) onto the stack when it encounters one. Conversely, it pops the last item from the stack when it encounters a closing parenthesis `)`.

Keeping track of the depth of the stack (the number of times `(` has been popped from the stack) yields the deepest level of nesting of parentheses in the chunk. This process continues for all chunks, calculating the nesting depth for each group of parentheses in the input string.

The resulting list of nesting levels is then returned as the output of the function. 

Overall, this function elegantly solves the problem using nested loops, stacks, and splitting, providing a straightforward way to extract the maximum nesting levels from groups of parentheses in a string.
