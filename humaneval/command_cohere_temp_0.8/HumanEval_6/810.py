```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for chunk in s.split():
        depth = 0
        balance = 0
        for char in chunk:
            if char == '(':
                depth += 1
                balance += 1
            elif char == ')':
                depth += -1
                balance -= 1
        result.append(balance)
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string (`s`) as input. This string is supposed to contain multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. The function calculates the deepest level of nesting of parentheses for each group and returns a list of these depths.

To accomplish this, the function performs several steps:
1. It splits the input string into a list of space-separated chunks, where each chunk represents a group of parentheses.
2. For each chunk, it initializes two variables: `depth` and `balance`. The `depth` keeps track of how many opening parentheses have been encountered, while `balance` keeps track of the imbalance of opening and closing parentheses.
3. The function iterates through each character of the chunk. If the character is an opening parenthesis `(`, it increments `depth` and increments `balance` by 1, indicating an increase in the imbalance.
4. Conversely, if the character is a closing parenthesis `)`, it decrements `depth` and decrements `balance` by 1, updating the imbalance accordingly.
5. After processing all characters in the chunk, the final value of `depth` represents the deepest level of nesting of parentheses. The imbalance `balance` is used to determine the maximum depth, where a balance of 0 indicates an even number of opening and closing parentheses, and therefore, no nesting.
6. The function collects these depths for each chunk in the input string and returns them as a list.

The example provided in the initial problem demonstrates how to use the function and showcases its ability to determine the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the input string.
