```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(int, group), [])))) for group in s.split()]
```

The provided Python script demonstrates a function called `parse_nested_parens`, which takes a string `s` as input and returns a list of integers. This function is designed to parse and evaluate nested parentheses in the input string, determining the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses.

Here's how it works:
- The function uses a list of typing to allow for multiple outputs.
- It first splits the input string `s` into a list of space-separated groups of parentheses, considering each group as a separate entity.
- The sum function is used to convert each group into a string of digits representing the depths of nesting for each opening and closing parenthesis pair.
- The `map(int, group)` converts each element of the string representation to an integer.
- The sum function again calculates the total integer depth for each group.
- The `max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(...))) `algorithm determines the maximum depth of nesting by finding the maximum value in the reversed sum.
- Finally, it returns a list where each element represents the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses.

This approach ensures that the function can handle multiple groups of parentheses with varying levels of nesting in a single string input.
