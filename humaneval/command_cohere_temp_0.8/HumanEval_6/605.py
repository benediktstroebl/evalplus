```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for seperated_group in s.split():
        count = 0
        for char in seperated_group:
            if char == '(':
                count += 1
            else:
                count -= 1
        result.append(count)
    return result
```

The logic of the provided solution is to iterate over each character in the separated group and keep tracking the number of open parentheses '(' with the help of a counter. The counter is increased when meeting an open parenthesis '(' and is decreased when meeting a closing parenthesis ')'. The resulted count will be the maximum depth of nesting for the parenthesis in the particular group. The solution uses Python's `typing` module to enhance code readability and maintainability.

This approach enables the function to process multiple groups of nested parentheses separately, as they are split by spaces, ensuring the result accuracy. The resulting list contains the maximum depths of nesting for each group in the input string. 

To validate the accuracy of the function, the following test cases can be used:
```python
def test_parse_nested_parens():
    # Validations for the correct function behavior
    assert parse_nested_parens("(()()) ((()))") == [2, 3]
    assert parse_nested_parens("((()))") == [2]
    assert parse_nested_parens("(()()) () ((())()())") == [2, 3, 1, 3]
    assert parse_nested_parens("(())") == [1]
    assert parse_nested_parens("()") == [0]
    assert parse_nested_parens("(())(())") == [2, 1, 1]

    # Checking the behavior of the function when an empty string is passed as an argument
    assert parse_nested_parens("") == []
```

To better understand the solution, let's break down the key components:
1. **Data Types**: The code starts by importing the `List` data type from the `typing` module. Utilizing data types enhances code readability and ensures the correct types are used throughout the function.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `parse_nested_parens` is defined, taking a single argument `s`, which is the input string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces.
3. **Result List**: Create an empty list called `result`, which will store the output for each group of nested parentheses.
4. **Splitting the Input String**: Use the `split()` method to split the input string `s` into a list of substrings, where each substring represents a group of nested parentheses.
5. **Counting Nested Levels**: For each substring in the `seperated_group` list, initialize a counter `count` to keep track of the number of open parentheses. Increase the `count` when meeting an open parenthesis `(` and decrease it when meeting a closing parenthesis `)`.
6. **Appending Result**: Finally, the maximum depth for each group is appended to the `result` list.
7. **Return the Result**: After processing all substrings, return the `result` list.

This solution is efficient with a time complexity of `O(n)` where `n` is the number of characters in the input string. It utilizes linear iteration to process each character in the string, which leads to a linear increase in time. The space complexity is `O(1)` since a constant amount of additional space is used, which is beneficial when
