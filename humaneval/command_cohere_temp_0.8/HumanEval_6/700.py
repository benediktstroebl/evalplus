                        stack.pop()

The specified Python script solves the problem of finding the maximum nesting level of parentheses in a given string. The `parse_nested_parens` function takes a string as input and returns a list of maximum depths of nesting for each group of parentheses separated by spaces. 

The solution works by:
1. Splitting the input string into individual groups of parentheses separated by spaces.
2. Maintaining a stack to track the parentheses encountered.
3. Keeping track of the unbalanced parentheses and updating the nesting level whenever a closing parenthesis is encountered.
4. The maximum depth of nesting for each group is calculated by counting the number of '(' and ')' characters and the resultant list of depths is returned.

The example usage and test cases provided ensure that the function behaves as expected and correctly calculates the maximum nesting levels for different strings of parentheses.

I hope this solution aids you in handling similar problems involving nested structures! Feel free to ask if you have any further questions or if you'd like assistance with any other coding challenges.
