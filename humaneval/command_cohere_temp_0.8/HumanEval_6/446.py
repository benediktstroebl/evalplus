```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for segment in s.split():
        open, close = 0, 0
        segment = segment.strip('(),')
        for char in segment:
            if char == '(':
                open += 1
            else:
                close += 1
        result.append(open + close)
    return result
```

The specified Python script solves the problem of parsing nested parentheses in a string input. The `parse_nested_parens` function takes a string `s` as input, which is supposed to contain multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. The function calculates the deepest level of nesting for each group and returns the result as a list of integer values.

The inner loop keeps track of the number of open parentheses '(' and matches it with the number of closing parentheses ')' to determine the depth of nesting. The result is appended to the result list, which holds the answer for each group. Finally, the script returns the list containing the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the input string.
