```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opening, closing in zip(*[iter(s.replace(' ', '').replace(')', ')) for _ in range(2)])]:
        count = 0
        while opening:
            opening -= 1
            count += 1
        result.append(count)
    return result
```
The provided Python script solves the problem of parsing nested parentheses and outputting the deepest level of nesting for each group in the input string.

Here's a breakdown of the code:
- The `from typing import List` import statement introduces the "typing" module, which enables type hinting.
- The `parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]` function takes a single argument, `s`, which is the input string containing nested parentheses, and returns a list of integer depths.
- The `result = []` line initializes an empty list called `result` to store the output depths.
- The `for opening, closing in zip(*[iter(s.replace(' ', '').replace(')', ')) for _ in range(2)])]` loop iterates through pairs of opening and closing parentheses.
- The `zip()` function takes multiple iterables (in this case, generated by `*[iter(s.replace(' ', '').replace(')', ')) for _ in range(2)])])` and returns a zip object that produces consecutive pairs of elements from the iterables.
- Inside the loop, the `count = 0` variable keeps track of the depth of nesting.
- The `while opening` condition evaluates to True when there are opening parentheses remaining, indicating that they are not balanced.
- During each iteration, the `opening -= 1` decreases the opening parentheses count, and `count += 1` increases the depth count whenever opening parentheses are found.
- The `result.append(count)` line appends the current nesting depth count to the `result` list.
- Once all iterations are completed, the function returns the `result` list containing the deepest level of nesting for each group in the input string.

The provided example output in the code block demonstrates the function's behavior on a sample input string.
