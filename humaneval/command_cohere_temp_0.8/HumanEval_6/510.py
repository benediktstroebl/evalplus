```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(lambda x: list(zip(x, x[1:]))), [])))) for x in s.split()]
```

The provided Python script defines a function `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `s` as input. This string contains multiple groups of parentheses separated by spaces. The function's purpose is to extract the deepest level of nesting of parentheses for each group and return the results as a list.

The core of the function is a list comprehension that iterates over the characters of the input string `s`. Pairs of opening and closing parentheses are created using the `zip` function, and the resulting pairs are aggregated using the `sum` function. The `map` function is applied to each group to construct a list of pairs of parentheses. The `max` function, when applied to the list of counts, returns the maximum count, representing the deepest nesting level.

The resulting list of deepest nesting levels for each group of parentheses is then returned by the function.
