```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for chunk in s.split(' '):
        counter = 0
        nesting = 0
        for char in chunk:
            if char == '(':
                counter += 1
            else:
                counter -= 1
            nesting = max(nesting, counter)
        result.append(nesting)
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens`, which takes a string input `s` that represents multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces. This function's purpose is to determine the deepest level of nesting for each group and return the results as a list.

Here's how it works:
1. The function initializes an empty list called `result` that will store the output.
2. It iterates over each chunk in the input string by splitting it using spaces as separators. Each chunk represents a group of parentheses.
3. For each chunk, it initializes a counter and a nesting level variable to keep track of the open parentheses encountered.
4. The loop iterates through each character in the chunk. If the character is `'('` (an open parenthesis), the counter is incremented, effectively counting the open parentheses. If the character is `')'` (a close parenthesis), the counter is decremented.
5. The `nesting` variable is updated using the maximum value between the current `nesting` and the counter. This step ensures that the `nesting` variable captures the deepest level of nesting encountered so far within the current chunk.
6. Finally, the function appends the `nesting` value for each chunk to the `result` list, which will contain the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses.

The provided example input and expected output demonstrate how this function effectively solves the problem of parsing nested parentheses and accurately calculating the deepest level of nesting for each group.
