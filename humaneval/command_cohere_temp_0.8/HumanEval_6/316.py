```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for segment in s.split():
        open_brackets = []
        clos_brack = 0
        for char in segment:
            if char == '(':
                open_brackets.append(clos_brack+)
            else:
                clos_brack += 1
        result.append(max(open_brackets))
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string (`s`) as input. This string contains multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. The function's purpose is to extract and parse each group of parentheses to determine the deepest level of nesting within each group.

Here's how it works:
1. The function initializes an empty list called `result`, which will store the output.
2. It iterates through the characters of each segment (a substring separated by spaces).
3. For each `'('` character encountered, it increments a counter tracking the deepest nesting level and adds the current count of closed parentheses to a list (`open_brackets`).
4. For each `')'` character encountered, it increments a counter tracking the current nesting level (clos_brack).
5. After processing all characters in a segment, the function calculates the maximum value from the `open_brackets` list, which represents the deepest level of nesting for that segment.
6. It then appends this maximum nesting level to the `result` list.
7. The function returns the `result` list, which contains the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the input string.

This algorithm ensures that each group of parentheses is correctly analyzed to determine its deepest level of nesting. It efficiently processes each segment of the input string, making it suitable for handling large and complex parentheses structures. The output is a list that corresponds to the maximum nesting level for each group, as described in the problem statement.
