```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(int, group), [])))) for group in s.split(' ')]
```

The provided Python script defines a function `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `s` as input. This string contains multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. The function's purpose is to extract the deepest level of nesting of parentheses for each group.

To achieve this, the function uses a combination of string splitting and integer conversion. It splits the input string into a list of substrings based on the spaces, then converts each substring to an integer representing the total number of parentheses. Finally, it extracts the deepest level of nesting by finding the maximum depth (measured in even levels) from the reversed sum of parentheses counts for each group.

The function returns a list of these deepest nesting levels for each group of parentheses in the input string.

The code includes type annotations with the `from typing import List` declaration and uses Python's type hinting to indicate that the function's output is a list of integers.

Note: The code assumes that the input string contains only valid parentheses groups and that all parentheses are balanced. It may require additional error handling and validation to handle scenarios with unbalanced or invalid parentheses.
