```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for bracket_pair in s.split():
        level = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(bracket_pair):
            if bracket_pair[i] == '(':
                level += 1
            elif bracket_pair[i] == ')':
                level -= 1
            i += 1
        result.append(level)
    return result
```

This Python script includes a `parse_nested_parens` function, which takes a string as input and returns a list of the deepest levels of nesting for each group of parentheses. The string is split into list elements based on spaces, and the nesting level is tracked by incrementing and decrementing a `level` variable depending on the encountered '(' ')' characters. The function returns a list of these nesting levels for each group of parentheses.

To demonstrate the function, we include a markdown cell with a test example and its expected output. The test case showcases multiple groups of parentheses separated by spaces, and the function is expected to return a list of the deepest levels of nesting for each group.

This code demonstrates how to parse and analyze nested structures in Python, which can be useful in various applications involving syntax analysis, shape recognition, or data parsing. You can adapt this function to solve related problems where you need to count the depth of nested structures in strings.
