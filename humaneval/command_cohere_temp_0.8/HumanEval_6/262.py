```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opener, closer in zip('([{', ')]}'):
        stack = [0]
        for ch in s:
            if ch == opener:
                stack.append(stack[-1] + 1)
            elif ch == closer:
                stack.pop()
        result.append(stack[-1])
    return result
```

The approach employs a stack to track the nesting level for each opening parenthesis encountered. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the stack is popped to adjust the current nesting level. Consequently, the final nesting level is obtained from the last element in the stack, representing the maximum depth of nesting within each group.

This code uses `zip('([{', ')]}')` to create iterators that produce opening and closing parentheses, extracting them from the input string `s`. It initializes a list `stack` to keep track of the nesting level and iterates through the characters of the input string.

When an opening parenthesis is encountered, it increments the last element of the `stack` by 1, representing the current nesting level. Conversely, when a closing parenthesis is encountered, it removes the last element from the stack, effectively reducing the nesting level.

Finally, the function returns a list `result` that contains the maximum nesting level for each group of parentheses encountered.
