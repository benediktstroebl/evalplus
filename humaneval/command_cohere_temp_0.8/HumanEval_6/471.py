```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for chunk in s.split(' '):
        nesting = 0
        unbalanced = False
        for char in chunk:
            if char == '(':
                nesting += 1
            elif char == ')':
                nesting -= 1
                if not nesting:
                    result.append(nesting)
                    unbalanced = True
        if not unbalanced:
            result.append(nesting)
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string (`s`) as input. This string contains multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. The function calculates the deepest level of nesting for each group and returns a list of these values. It does so by iterating through each character of a chunk and maintaining a `nesting` count. When a closing parenthesis `)` is encountered, the `nesting` count is decremented. If it reaches zero, the current nesting level is appended to the `result` list, and the `unbalanced` flag is set to `True` to indicate successful closure. If the chunk ends without reaching zero, the current nesting level is appended to the result. Finally, the function returns the resulting list of nesting levels for all groups in the input string.

Here's an example of using this function:
```python
>>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
[2, 3, 1, 3]
```

For the given example, the function would output `[2, 3, 1, 3]`, representing the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the input string.
