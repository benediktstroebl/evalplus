```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opener, closer in zip('(()')[::-1], '())':
        stack = [0]
        for ch in s:
            if ch == opener:
                stack.append(stack[-1] + 1)
            elif ch == closer:
                stack.pop()
        result.append(stack[0])
    return result
```

The approach employed in the function `parse_nested_parens` is iterative and utilizes a stack to keep track of the depth of each opening parenthesis. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, incrementing the stack when an opening parenthesis is encountered and decrementing when a closing parenthesis is encountered. The final depth is assumed to be the value of the last element in the stack.

The result is a list where each element represents the deepest level of nesting for the respective group of parentheses.
