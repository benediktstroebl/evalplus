The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string as input and returns a list of integers. This function is designed to solve the problem of parsing nested parentheses in a given string.

Here's how the function works:
1. It uses the `zip` function to create pairs of matching parentheses, effectively comparing opening parentheses with closing parentheses.
2. For each pair of parentheses, it maintains variables like `depth` to track the current nesting depth, `nested` to keep track of the maximum depth reached within a nested block, and `nest` to monitor the current nesting block.
3. As the function iterates through each pair of parentheses, it adjusts the `depth` accordingly when encountering opening or closing parentheses. If the `nest` value is greater than 0, it updates the `nested` value with the maximum depth reached within the current nesting block.
4. Finally, the function constructs a list of integers that represent the maximum depth of nesting for each group of parentheses.

This approach ensures that the function correctly handles nested parentheses and provides the deepest level of nesting for each group.
