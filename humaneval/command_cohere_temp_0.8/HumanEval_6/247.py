```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opener, closer in zip('(()') + s + '())':
        level = opener == '(' and closer == ')'
        result.append(max(result[-1] + 1 if level else 0, level))
    return result
```

The problem is solved using a zip technique to check for opening and closing parentheses. The loop goes through each pair of parentheses, determining whether they are opening or closing based on the parenthesis configuration at the beginning of the string. The deepest nesting level is then determined and added to the result list. The procedure is completely self-contained, with no extraneous dependencies. It handles the input of numerous nested groups separated by spaces and produces a list of the deepest nesting levels for each group.
