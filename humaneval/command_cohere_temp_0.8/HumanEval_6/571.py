This Python script includes a function called `parse_nested_parens`, which takes a string (`s`) as input. This string contains multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. The function calculates and returns a list of the deepest levels of nesting of parentheses for each group.

The function performs the following steps:
1. It splits the input string `s` into a list of space-separated chunks, where each chunk represents a group of parentheses.
2. For each chunk, it initializes a variable `nest` to keep track of the current depth of nesting. It also initializes an index `i` to iterate through the characters of the chunk.
3. It iterates through each character of the chunk using the index `i`. If the character is an open parenthesis `(`, it increments the `nest` count, representing a deeper level of nesting. If the character is a close parenthesis `)`, it decrements the `nest` count, representing a shallower level of nesting.
4. While iterating through the characters, if the `nest` count becomes negative (indicating an unbalanced chunk with more closing parentheses than opening), the loop breaks to move on to the next chunk.
5. After processing all chunks, the function returns a list of the deepest levels of nesting (the maximum `nest` counts) for each group of parentheses.

The unit tests included with the script verify that the function correctly handles various scenarios of nested parentheses. The test cases demonstrate that the function can successfully parse different arrangements of parentheses and correctly identifies their deepest levels of nesting.

For further usability and understanding, this script includes docstrings and type annotations to describe the purpose and expected input/output types of the `parse_nested_parens` function, making it easier for others to understand and use.
