```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for token in s.split():
        level = 0
        stack = []
        for c in token:
            if c == '(':
                stack.append(c)
                level += 1
            else:
                stack.pop()
                level -= 1
        result.append(level)
    return result
```

The given Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `s` as input. This string contains multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. The function calculates and returns a list of the deepest levels of nesting of parentheses for each group.

The function iterates through the string split into tokens using the `split()` method. For each token, it maintains a stack of parentheses using a list to keep track of the nesting level. When encountering an opening parenthesis `(`, it pushes it onto the stack and increments the nesting level. When encountering a closing parenthesis `)`, it pops the last element from the stack and decrements the nesting level.

The deepest level of nesting for each token is accumulated into the `result` list. Finally, the function returns the list of deepest nesting levels for each group of parentheses in the input string.
