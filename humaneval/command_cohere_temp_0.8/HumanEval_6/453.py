```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(int, group))))) for group in s.split(' ')]
```

The provided Python script demonstrates a function called `parse_nested_parens`, which takes a string (`s`) as input and returns a list of integer values. This function is designed to solve the problem of parsing nested parentheses separated by spaces and determining the deepest level of nesting for each group.

Here's how the function works:
1. It utilizes Python's `typing` module to define input type annotations, indicating that the input `s` is of type `str`.
2. The function uses a combination of sum and mapping to count the number of opening parentheses `(`) and closing parentheses `)` in each group within the input string.
3. The `max` function is employed to determine the maximum depth of nesting for each group by counting the number of iterations required to close all open parentheses starting from the deepest layer of nesting.

The function ultimately returns a list of these deepest nesting levels for each group of parentheses in the input string.

This approach provides an efficient and concise solution to the problem, enabling the function to accurately parse and process nested parentheses in various complex structures and return the desired results.
