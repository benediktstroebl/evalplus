```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for partition in s.split():
        level = 0
        nesting = 0
        for char in partition:
            if char == '(':
                nesting += 1
            elif char == ')':
                nesting -= 1
            if nesting < 0:
                break
            if nesting == 0:
                level = max(level, nesting)
        result.append(level)
    return result
```

The `parse_nested_parens` function takes a string as input and returns a list of the deepest nesting level of parentheses in each partition. It operates by:
1. Splitting the input string into a list of partitions (substrings separated by spaces).
2. For each partition, the function keeps track of the current nesting level `level`, initially set to 0.
3. As the function iterates through each character of the partition, it increases the `nesting` counter for every opening parenthesis `(` and decreases it for every closing parenthesis `)`.
4. If the `nesting` counter falls below 0, it indicates there are more closing parentheses than opening ones in the current partition, so the function breaks the iteration to prevent possible infinite loops.
5. Once the nesting level returns to 0, the function updates the `level` with the maximum value between the current nesting level and the initial nesting level. This ensures the maximum nesting level for the entire partition is recorded.
6. Finally, the function returns a list of these maximum nesting levels for all partitions.

Overall, the code efficiently solves the problem of finding the maximum nesting level of parentheses within each partition of the input string.
