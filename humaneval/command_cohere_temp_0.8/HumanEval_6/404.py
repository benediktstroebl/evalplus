```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for i, char in enumerate(s.split()):
        num_open, num_closed = 0, 0
        for c in char:
            if c == '(':
                num_open += 1
            else:
                num_closed += 1
        result.append(num_open - num_closed)
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string as input and returns a list of integer values. This function is designed to solve the problem of parsing nested parentheses in a given string and determining the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses.

The solution uses a simple algorithm that iterates through the characters of each group of parentheses, keeping track of the number of open and closed parentheses. The difference between these counts gives the depth of nesting for that group. This depth is then added to the result list.

To split the input string into individual groups of parentheses, the script utilizes the `split()` method, which treats spaces as delimiters. This approach allows for handling multiple groups of parentheses within a single string, where each group is separated by spaces.
