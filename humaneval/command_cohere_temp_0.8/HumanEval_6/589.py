The specified Python script defines a single function `parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]` that solves the problem. This function's purpose is to iterate through a string `s` partitioned by spaces, identify parentheses (`(` and `)`) in each partition, and calculate the deepest level of nesting for each group.

Here's a step-by-step description of how this function operates:
1. **Type Annotation**: The function starts with a type annotation stating that its input `s` is a string, and its output is a list of integers.
2. **Split Partitioning**: The function iterates through each partition of the string `s`, which is achieved by splitting `s` using whitespace (spaces). This methodology handles the assumption that parentheses groups are separated by spaces.
3. **Deepest Level Tracking**: For each partition, the function maintains a `level` counter that tracks the deepest level of nesting of parentheses. Initially, the `level` is set to 0.
4. **Nested List**: To accommodate situations where a closing parenthesis `)` is encountered, but it does not match the most recent opening parenthesis, a `nesting` list is utilized. This list keeps track of the respective levels of each opening parenthesis encountered, and it guides the appropriate subtraction of `level` when a mismatched `)` is encountered.
5. **Handling Opening Parentheses (`)****: Whenever an opening parenthesis is encountered, its level is added to the `level` counter, and that value is appended to the `nesting` list. This captures the start of a new nesting depth.
6. **Handling Closing Parentheses (`))`****: When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the function checks the `nesting` list. If the most recent element in the `nesting` list is greater than the current `level`, it means a mismatched closing parenthesis is encountered, and the function increments the `level` accordingly. However, if the most recent element in the `nesting` list is equal to or less than the current `level`, the `level` is decremented, reflecting the correct nesting depth.
7. **Final Output**: The function returns a list where each element represents the deepest nesting level for each corresponding partition (or group of parentheses).
