```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(lambda x: list(zip(x, x[1:]))), [])))) for s in s.split()]
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` which takes a string `s` as input. This string `s` contains multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. The function returns a list where each element represents the deepest level of nesting of parentheses in its corresponding group. To achieve this, the function uses a list comprehension and the `max` function to find the maximum depth of nesting (where depth is calculated as number of nested parentheses divided by 2) for each group of parentheses. Test cases are provided to validate the functionality of the code.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'))
```

The output of this example will be:
```python
[2, 3, 1, 3]
```

This represents the four different groups of parentheses and their respective maximum nesting levels, where the levels are 2, 3, 1, and 3 in the given order.
