```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for segment in s.split():
        open_brackets = [1]
        sum_of_depth = 0
        for char in segment:
            if char == '(':
                open_brackets.append(open_brackets[-1] + 1)
            else:
                sum_of_depth += open_brackets.pop()
        result.append(sum_of_depth)
    return result
```

The given Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `s` as input. This string contains multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. The function calculates and returns a list of the deepest levels of nesting of parentheses for each group. It does so in the following way:
- It splits the input string into segments using spaces as separators, essentially separating the groups of parentheses.
- For each segment, it initializes an integer list `open_brackets` to keep track of the open brackets encountered. It also initializes a variable `sum_of_depth` to accumulate the sum of the depths of nesting.
- As it iterates through each character of the segment, it increments the `open_brackets` if the character is `(`. This simulates the depth of nesting of parentheses.
- When the closing parenthesis `)` is encountered, it subtracts the deepest open bracket from the `open_brackets`, effectively reducing the depth of nesting. It also adds the current depth of nesting `open_brackets[-1]` to the `sum_of_depth`.
- Finally, the function returns a list of the sums of depths of nesting for each segment, which represents the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses.

This approach ensures that the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the given string is correctly calculated and returned as a list.
