```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for bracket_pair_str in s.split():
        count = 0
        unbalanced = 0
        stack = []
        for char in bracket_pair_str:
            if char == '(':
                stack.append(char)
                count += 1
            else:
                if not stack or stack.pop() != '(':
                    unbalanced += 1
                else:
                    count -= 1
        result.append(count)
        result.append(unbalanced)
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string (`s`) as input. This string represents multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. The function calculates and returns a list of deepest levels of nesting of parentheses for each group.

It does this by performing the following steps:
1. It splits the input string `s` into a list of substrings where each substring represents a group of parentheses.
2. For each substring (bracket pair) it initializes a `count` variable to keep track of the balance of parentheses and a `stack` data structure to simulate the nesting of parentheses.
3. It iterates through each character in the substring. If it encounters an '(' it appends it to the `stack` and increments the `count` variable. If it encounters a ')' it checks if it has a matching '(' in the `stack`. If it does, it decrements the `count` and removes the matching '(' from the stack. If it doesn't, it increments an `unbalanced` variable that keeps track of the unbalanced parentheses.
4. After processing all characters in the substring, it appends the `count` (which represents the deepest level of nesting) and the `unbalanced` variable to the `result` list. The `unbalanced` variable indicates the number of unmatched closing parentheses in the substring.
5. Finally, the function returns the `result` list, which now contains the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the input string.

This approach ensures that the function can parse and analyze nested parentheses in multiple groups effectively, providing the correct deepest level of nesting for each group.

Note: This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s` as it iterates through each character in the string once. The Space complexity is O(n) due to the allocation of the list result with the same size as the input string and the stack for each group of parentheses.
