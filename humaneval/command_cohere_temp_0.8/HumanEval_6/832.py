```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for partition in s.split():
        level = 0
        subs = partition.lstrip('(').rstrip(')').split('(')
        for i in range(len(subs)):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                level += subs[i].count(')')
            else:
                level += (len(subs[i]) - subs[i].count(')'))
        result.append(level)
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `s` as input. This string contains multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. The function calculates and returns a list of the deepest levels of nesting of parentheses for each group.

The function iterates over the partitions of the input string created by splitting it using spaces as separators. For each partition (a substring with nested parentheses), it initializes a level variable to 0, which keeps track of the deepest nesting level encountered.

To determine the deepest nesting level, the function manipulates the partition string in a clever way. It splits the partition string at the highest level of parentheses ('(') and removes the opening parentheses ('(') and closing parentheses (')') from each split string. The splitting and removal of parentheses are done in a way that preserves the deepest nesting level.

Finally, the function appends the calculated nesting level to the result list, which is returned once all partitions have been processed.
