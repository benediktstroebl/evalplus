```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for i, char in enumerate(s.split()):
        nested = 0
        open_par = 0
        for j, c in enumerate(char):
            if c == '(':
                open_par += 1
                nested = max(nested, open_par)
            else:
                open_par -= 1
        result.append(nested)
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string input (`s`) as its argument. This function processes each group of parentheses within the string by splitting it into individual characters and analyzing their nesting levels.

Here's how it works:
1. The function iterates over each character in the split input string using `enumerate`, which also provides the index `i`.
2. It initializes a variable `nested` to track the maximum depth of parentheses nesting within each group. It also sets `open_par` to 0 at the beginning of each group to reset the open parenthesis count.
3. As it iterates through each character `c` within the group, the function increments `open_par` if the character is '(', representing an open parenthesis. The `nested` variable is updated using the max function to keep track of the maximum nesting level encountered so far.
4. If the character is ')', the function decrements `open_par` to properly manage the open parentheses count.
5. Once all characters in a group are processed, the `nested` value for that group is appended to the `result` list. This process is repeated for each group (split by spaces).
6. Finally, the function returns the list of deepest nesting levels for each group of parentheses in the input string.

The example provided in the initial problem demonstrates the usage and behavior of this function:
```python
 input = '(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'
print(parse_nested_parens(input))
```

This would produce the output:
```bash
[2, 3, 1, 3]
```

The function accurately parses the input string and returns a list that represents the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses.
