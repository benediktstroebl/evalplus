```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opener, closer in zip('(()', '))'):
        stack = [0]
        level = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == opener:
                stack.append(level)
                level += 1
            elif c == closer:
                level -= 1
                stack.append(level)
        result.append(stack.pop())
    return result
```

The approach employs a straightforward procedural methodology. It iterates through each character in the input string, tracking the nesting level through a `stack` variable. When opening parentheses are encountered, the nesting level is recorded and incremented; when closing parentheses are met, the level is decremented and added to the stack. The final value popped from the stack represents the deepest nesting level of the respective parentheses group.

To best utilize the `zip` function, which combines iterables in a tuple, it is essential to ensure that the opening and closing parentheses are of the same length.
