            elif char == Closer:
                level -= 1

                break
            if opener == Closer and level == 0:
                result.append(level)
                start = i
        if opener == Closer:

This code snippet utilizes a generator expression in conjunction with list comprehension to parse and collect the results. It employs a zipper algorithm to efficiently determine the deepest nesting level of each group. The function iterates through each character of the input string, maintaining a `level` counter that tracks the nesting depth. When an opening parenthesis is encountered, the `level` is increased, and when a closing parenthesis is encountered, the `level` is decreased. The algorithm detects when a full group is closed and records the deepest nesting level of that group. After processing all characters, any remaining unbalanced groups (if any) are considered as a single group with a level of 0. The resulting list of deepest nesting levels for each group is then returned. 

Here is a simple example of input-output pairs that would work with this function:
**Input:**
```
(()()) ((())) () ((())()())
```

**Output:**
```
[2, 3, 1, 3]
```

**Input:**
```
(()()())
```

**Output:**
```
[2]
```

**Input:**
```
()()()()
```

**Output:**
```
[1]
```
