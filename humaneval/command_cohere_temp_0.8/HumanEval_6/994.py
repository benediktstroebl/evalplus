Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem using a concise and efficient approach:
```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(nesting, 1 if char in '(){}' else 0)
            for char, nesting in zip(s, iterate_nesting(s))]

def iterate_nesting(s: str) -> List[int]:
    """Iterate over each character and its nesting level (0 for outermost parens, 1 for nested parens, etc.)."""
    stack, result = [], []
    for char in s:
        if char in '({[':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in ')}]':
            stack.pop()
        else:
            result.append(len(stack))
    return result
```

This approach uses a function called `iterate_nesting` to produce a list where each element represents the nesting level of the corresponding character in the string. The `parse_nested_parens` function then extracts and returns the required list of deepest nesting levels for each group of parentheses.
