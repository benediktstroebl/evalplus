```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for token in s.split():
        level = 0
        nested = 0
        i = 0
        for char in token:
            if char == '(':
                nested += 1
            else:
                nested -= 1
            level = max(level, nested)
        result.append(level)
    return result
```

The given Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string (`s`) as input. This string is assumed to contain multiple groups of parentheses separated by spaces, where each group represents a nested structure of parentheses. The function calculates the deepest level of nesting for each group and returns a list of these depths.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
result = parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
print(result)
```

This would output the following:
```
[2, 3, 1, 3]
```

The script uses a combination of typing and dynamic programming. For each group of parentheses, it initializes a level counter to 0 and a nested counter to 0. It then iterates through each character in the token. If the character is `(`, the nested counter is increased, and the level counter is updated to the maximum of the current level and the current nested level. On the other hand, if the character is `)`, the nested counter is decreased. This way, the `level` counter always keeps track of the deepest level of nesting for each token.

Finally, the function returns a list of these level values, one for each group of parentheses in the input string.
