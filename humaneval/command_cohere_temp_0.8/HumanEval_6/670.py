```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for bracket_str in s.split():
        level = 0
        for char in bracket_str:
            if char == '(':
                level += 1
            elif char == ')':
                level -= 1
            result.append(level)
    return result
```

The given Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string (`s`) as input. This string contains multiple groups of parentheses separated by spaces, and the function's task is to calculate the deepest level of nesting for each group. The function splits the input string into individual bracket sequences using the `split()` method, which separates the string into a list of substrings using the space as a delimiter.

For each bracket sequence, the function maintains a `level` variable, which represents the current depth of nesting. It initializes `level` to 0 before iterating through each character of the bracket sequence. If the character is `'('` (an open parenthesis), the `level` is incremented, indicating that the nesting has increased. Conversely, if the character is `')'` (a close parenthesis), the `level` is decremented, reflecting a decrease in nesting depth.

As the function iterates through each character of the bracket sequence, it keeps track of the maximum depth of nesting encountered. The final value of `level` for each bracket sequence is appended to a list called `result`. Therefore, `result` contains the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the input string.

The script's example usage demonstrates the function's effectiveness by applying it to a string containing multiple nested parentheses. The function returns a list where each element represents the deepest level of nesting for the corresponding parenthesis group. This solution efficiently solves the problem and provides the correct result.
