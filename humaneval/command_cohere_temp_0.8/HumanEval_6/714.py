```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    forOpening, i, numOpen = 0, 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '(':
            forOpening += 1
            numOpen += 1
        else:
            forOpening -= 1
        if forOpening == 0:
            result.append(numOpen)
            numOpen = 0
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string (`s`) as input. This string represents multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. The function calculates and returns a list of the deepest levels of nesting of parentheses for each group.

The logic within the function involves maintaining three important variables:
- `forOpening`: This variable counts the number of '(' (opening parentheses) encountered consecutively. It helps determine the current depth of nesting.
- `i`: This variable serves as a counter to keep track of the current position in the string.
- `numOpen`: This variable maintains the actual depth of the current nest, ensuring that when an '(' is encountered, `numOpen` increases, and when a ')' is encountered, `numOpen` decreases.

As the function iterates through each character of the input string, it adjusts the `forOpening` and `numOpen` based on whether the character is an opening or closing parenthesis. When the `forOpening` reaches 0, indicating the end of a group, the current value of `numOpen` is appended to the `result` list. This way, the function captures the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the given string.
