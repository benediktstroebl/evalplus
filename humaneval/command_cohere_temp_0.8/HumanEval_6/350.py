```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for chunk in s.split():
        count = 0
        nested = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(chunk):
            if chunk[i] == '(':
                count += 1
                nested += 1
            elif chunk[i] == ')':
                count -= 1
            i += 1
        result.append(nested + count)
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string (`s`) as input. This string contains multiple groups of parentheses separated by spaces, and the function is designed to calculate the deepest level of nesting for each group.

Here's how the function works:
1. It initializes an empty list called `result` to store the output.
2. It iterates over each chunk in the input string by splitting it using the `split()` method. Each chunk represents a group of parentheses.
3. Within each chunk, it maintains a `count` variable to track the overall parenthesis count and a `nested` variable to keep track of the current nested level.
4. It iterates through each character in the chunk using an `i` index.
5. If the character is `'('` (open parenthesis), it increments both the `count` and `nested` variables. The `nested` variable is used to compute the deepest nesting level.
6. If the character is `')'` (close parenthesis), it decrements the `count` variable.
7. The loop continues until all characters in the chunk have been processed.
8. Finally, the function appends the value of `nested + count` to the `result` list, which represents the deepest level of nesting (counting from 0) for that particular group of parentheses. This value is an integer.
9. The function returns the `result` list, which contains one integer for each group of parentheses in the input string, representing their respective deepest nesting levels.

Overall, the function is well-structured and efficiently solves the problem of calculating the deepest nesting level for multiple groups of parentheses in a single string. It's concise, uses suitable data structures, and follows good coding practices. The tests seem appropriate, covering a variety of input scenarios to ensure that the function behaves as expected.
