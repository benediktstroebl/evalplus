```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for bracket_pair_str in s.split():
        bracket_pair = [open_bracket, close_bracket] = [bracket for bracket in bracket_pair_str if bracket in '()']
        result.append(len(open_bracket) - len(close_bracket))
    return result
```

The approach employs a simple algorithm that iterates over each bracket pair in the string, determining the number of open and close brackets, and calculating the depth as the difference between the lengths of these two strings. This difference signifies the deepest level of nesting for the given pair of brackets. The function outputs a list of these depths for each group of parentheses in the provided string. 

To ensure clarity, here is a breakdown of the code:
- The `from typing import List` line imports the `List` type from the typing module, allowing for type annotations. 
- The function `parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]` takes a string `s` as input and returns a list of integers representing the depths of nesting for each group of parentheses.
- Inside the function, `result = []` initialized an empty list called `result` to store the depths of nesting for each group of parentheses.  
- The `for bracket_pair_str in s.split():` loop iterates over each space-separated group of parentheses in the input string `s`.  
- Within this loop, `bracket_pair = [open_bracket, close_bracket] = ...` assigns the open and close brackets of the current group to the variables `open_bracket` and `close_bracket`. The list `bracket_pair_str` is transformed into a list of two elements: the open bracket and the close bracket, using `[]`. The assignment uses the `=` shortcut assignment operator.
- The line `result.append(len(open_bracket) - len(close_bracket))` calculates the depth of nesting for the current group of parentheses by subtracting the length of the close bracket from the length of the open bracket. The result is appended to the `result` list. 
- The function returns the `result` list once all the iterations are done. 

This code is structured to be efficient and follows the standard Python style, adhering to community norms for code clarity. It's important to note, however, that in cases where efficiency is a concern, there are more optimized algorithms targeting this specific problem, such as the `counting` algorithm, which offers a linear rather than linearithmic time complexity.
