```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opening, closing in zip(*[iter(s.replace(' ', '').replace(')', '').replace('(', '')) for _ in range(2)]):
        curr = 0
        while opening > closing:
            opening = opening.replace('(', '(')
            curr += 1
        result.append(curr)
    return result
```
The task is to parse a string with nested parentheses and output the deepest level of nesting for each group. The Python script provided uses iteration and string manipulation with an optional list comprehension to solve the problem.

The function `parse_nested_parens` takes a string as input and returns a list where each element represents the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses. It uses `zip` to create iterators for opening and closing parentheses and uses corresponding `replace` strings to synchronize them and track the current nesting level `curr`. The list comprehension is used to appends results for each step of iteration.
