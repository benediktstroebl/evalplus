```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opener, Closer in zip('(()') + s + '())':
        stack = [0]
        while opener != Closer:
            if opener == '(':
                stack.append(stack[-1] + 1)
            else:
                stack.append(max(stack))
        result.append(stack.pop())
    return result
```

The approach employed by the function `parse_nested_parens` is iterative and leverages a stack to efficiently determine the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the provided input string. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:
1. The function initiates an empty list called `result`, which will store the ultimate output - the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses.
2. The function iterates through each group of parentheses in the input string. To accomplish this, it utilizes the zip function, which combines the input string with a predefined opener string ('(()'). This results in an iterator yielding each successive pair of opening and closing parentheses, in the order they appear in the input string.
3. For each opener/closer pair, the function initializes a stack to keep track of the level of nesting for that particular group of parentheses. The stack is initialized with a single element, 0, to represent the initial depth before any nesting is encountered.
4. As the function iterates through each opener/closer pair, it performs a check on the current opener. If the opener is '(', it pushes the current depth (top of the stack) + 1 onto the stack. This signifies that we've entered a new level of nesting. If the opener is ')', the function instead pushes the maximum value of the current depth (top of the stack) and the expected depth (expected maximum depth for this group) onto the stack. This process continues until the opener and closer match, at which point the maximum depth of nesting for that group is popped from the stack.
5. The popped deepest level of nesting for each group is then appended to the `result` list.
6. Finally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the order they appeared in the input string. 

By following this process, the function can accurately determine and return the maximum depth of nesting for multiple groups of parentheses within a single string.
