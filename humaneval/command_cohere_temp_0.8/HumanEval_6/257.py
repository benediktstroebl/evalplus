```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for segment in s.split():
        nest = 0
        imbalance = 0
        for char in segment:
            if char == '(':
                nest += 1
                imbalance += 1
            else:
                nest -= 1
                imbalance -= 1
            result.append(max(0, nest))
    return result
```

The approach employs a simple loop to iterate through each segment of the input string and maintain a 'nest' count of open parentheses encountered. As the loop proceeds, the 'nest' count is incremented for each '(' encountered and decremented for each ')' encountered. 'imbalance' counts the total imbalance of open parentheses encountered, ensuring that the total number of open parentheses is always equal to the number of closed parentheses.

To achieve the goal of finding the maximum depth of nesting for each segment, 'nest' is used to keep track of the current depth of nesting, and 'imbalance' is used to keep track of the number of open parentheses encountered since the last closed parenthesis.

When the loop finishes for each segment, the result contains the maximum depth of nesting for that segment, represented as a list element. Finally, the entire list is returned to convey the result for each segment, with the maximum depth of nesting for each.
