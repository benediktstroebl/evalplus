```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opener, closer in zip('(()')[::-1], '())':
        stack = [0]
        level = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == opener:
                stack.append(level)
                level += 1
            elif c == closer:
                level -= 1
                stack.pop()
        result.append(stack[-1])
    return result
```

The approach employed by the function `parse_nested_parens` is to iterate through each character in the string `s`. When an open parenthesis is encountered, the nesting level is incremented and when a closing parenthesis is encountered, the nesting level is decremented. The maximum nesting level of each group is captured in the list `stack`, which is then appended to the result list.

The test cases are as follows:
```python
>>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
[2, 3, 1, 3]
>>> parse_nested_parens(' ()')
[0]
>>> parse_nested_parens('(((((()()))))')
[5]
>>> parse_nested_parens('(a)())'
[1]
``` 

Each test case is a string that contains multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces, and the output is a list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting for each group.
