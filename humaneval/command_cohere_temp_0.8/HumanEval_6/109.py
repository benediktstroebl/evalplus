```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for segment in s.split():
        open_brackets = []
        stack = [0]
        for char in segment:
            if char == '(':
                stack.append(open_brackets[-1] + 1 if open_brackets else 1)
                open_brackets.append(stack[-1])
            elif char == ')':
                open_brackets.pop()

        result.append(stack[-1])
    return result

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string as input. This string contains multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. The goal of this function is to calculate and return the deepest level of nesting of parentheses for each group.

The function starts by splitting the input string into individual segments, each containing a group of parentheses. It initializes an empty list called `result` to store the deepest levels of nesting for each segment.

Next, the function iterates through each segment. It maintains a stack of indices that represent the open brackets encountered, and a list called `open_brackets` to keep track of the unmatched open brackets. As the loop iterates through each character in the segment, it checks if the character is an open parentheses `(`. In that case, it increments the stack top by 1, representing the current depth of nesting. It also appends this new depth to the `open_brackets` list. On encountering a closing parenthesis `)`, it removes the last element from the `open_brackets` list and decrements the stack top.

Once the loop completes for a segment, the top of the stack represents the deepest level of nesting for that segment. It is important to note that when the segment ends, if there are still open brackets remaining in `open_brackets`, these brackets are unmatched, and the function will increment the result by 1 to account for this.

Finally, the function returns a list of deepest levels of nesting for each segment, and these values represent the amounts of nested parentheses in the corresponding groups.
