```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opening, closing in zip(*[iter(s.split())] * 2):
        depth = 0
        curr = opening
        while curr != closing:
            if curr == '(':
                depth += 1
            elif curr == ')':
                depth -= 1
            curr = next(closing)
        result.append(depth)
    return result
```

The approach involves iterating through each pair of opening and closing parentheses and keeping track of the depth of nesting using a counter. Once we reach the matching closing parenthesis, we add the accumulated depth to the result list.

To achieve this, we use a zip(*[iter(s.split())] * 2) which iterates over pairs of adjacent elements in the split string. The nested list of opening parentheses is iterated over in the first position, followed by the list of closing parentheses in the second position.

During each iteration, we check the current opening parenthesis and increment the depth counter if it's an opening parenthesis '('. Conversely, if it's a closing parenthesis ')', we decrement the depth.

We use the next(closing) function to skip over closing parentheses that are not the matching ones for the current opening parenthesis. This ensures we reach the correct depth value by skipping over unnecessary closing parentheses.

The final result list contains the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the provided string.
