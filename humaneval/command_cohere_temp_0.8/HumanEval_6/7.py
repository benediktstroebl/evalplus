```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for segment in s.split():
        open_par = segment.count('(')
        close_par = segment.count(')')
        result.append(open_par - close_par)
    return result
```

The code utilizes a simple approach to parse the input string consisting of different segments represented by parentheses occurrences to determine the deepest level of nesting for each segment. It achieves this by counting the number of '(' and ')' characters, and subtracting one from the other to obtain the nesting level, which is then appended to the `result` list. The returned list contains the deepest level of nesting for each segment of the input string.
