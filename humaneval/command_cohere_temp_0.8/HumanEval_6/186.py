```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opener, closer in zip('(()', '))'):
        stack = [0]
        level = 0
        for ch in s:
            if ch == opener:
                stack.append(level)
                level += 1
            elif ch == closer:
                level = stack.pop()
        result.append(level)
    return result
```

The approach employed by the function `parse_nested_parens` is by iterating through the input string `s` and keeping track of the current nesting level in a list `stack`. When an opening parenthesis is encountered, the nesting level is incremented and added to the stack. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the top element from the stack is popped, effectively reducing the nesting level. This process continues until all characters in the string have been processed. Finally, the resulting list of nesting levels for each group separated by spaces is returned.
