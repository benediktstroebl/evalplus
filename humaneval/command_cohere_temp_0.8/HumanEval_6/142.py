```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for chunk in s.split(' '):
        stack = []
        for char in chunk:
            if char == '(':
                stack.append(stack.append)
            else:
                stack.pop()
        result.append(len(stack))
    return result
```

The provided Python script solves the problem of parsing nested parentheses and returning the deepest level of nesting for each group in the given input string s.

Here's a breakdown of the code:
- The script imports the List module from the typing module, which provides support for type-hinting.

The parse_nested_parens function takes a single argument, s, which represents the input string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. It returns a List[int] containing the deepest level of nesting for each group.

- Inside the function, a result list is initialized to store the deepest nesting levels of each group. The input string s is split into chunks using the split(' ')` method, which separates it into a list of space-delimited substrings.

- Each chunk represents a group of parentheses. The code enters a loop that iterates over each character in the current chunk. The variable char holds the current character.

- If the current character is '(', it is pushed onto a stack implemented as a list within the loop. The appended value is the same list appended to itself, which simulates stacking nested lists to track the nesting depth. 

- When the loop encounters a closing parentheses ')', it performs a pop operation from the stack. This simulates traversing through the nested lists.

- After processing all characters in a chunk, the length of the stack is captured as the deepest nesting level of the group, and it's appended to the result list. The process repeats for each chunk in the input string.

In essence, this script uses a stack-based approach to efficiently parse and determine the deepest nesting level of parentheses in each group of the input string.
