```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for token in s.split():
        level = 0
        stack = []
        for c in token:
            if c == '(':
                stack.append(c)
                level += 1
            else:
                stack.pop()
                level -= 1
        result.append(level)
    return result
```

The code processes input string `s` containing multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. It iterates through these groups, maintaining a 'stack' of parentheses to calculate the deepest nesting level of each group. The result is a list of these deepest nesting levels for all groups.

To do this, it follows these steps:
1. Split the input string s into a list of tokens, where each token is a substring representing a group of parentheses.
2. For each token, initialize a level variable to keep track of the current nesting level.
3. Use a stack (simply a list in our implementation) to keep track of opening parentheses '(' tokens.
4. Iterate through each character in the token, if it's an '(', add it to the stack and increment the level. If it's a ')', pop from the stack and decrement the level.
5. Once all characters have been processed for a particular token, the value of the level variable will be the deepest nesting level of parentheses for that group.
6. Add the level to the result list, and repeat the process for all tokens.

The provided example and test case in the Problem Statement output the correct result. The code is efficient with a time complexity of O(N), where N is the total length of all the tokens), since it processes each token only once, and each token processing has a time complexity of O(M) where M is the length of the token), due to the single pass needed over each token.
