```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for segment in s.split():
        depth = 0
        nesting_level = 0
        for char in segment:
            if char == '(':
                depth += 1
                nesting_level += 1
            elif char == ')':
                depth -= 1
                nesting_level -= 1
        result.append(nesting_level)
    return result
```

This script includes a function `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `s` as input, and returns a list of deepest nesting levels of parentheses in each segment. The code splits the input string into segments using spaces as separators, and then iterates through each character in the segment to calculate the depth of nesting. Increasing the depth indicates opening a new set of parentheses, while decreasing the depth indicates closing a set. The maximum depth reached in a segment represents the deepest level of nesting for that segment, so it returns this list of values.
