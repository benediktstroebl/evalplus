```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for chunk in s.split(' '):
        counter = 0
        nesting = 0
        for char in chunk:
            if char == '(':
                counter += 1
            elif char == ')':
                counter -= 1
                if counter == 0:
                    nesting += 1
        result.append(nesting)
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string as input. This string contains multiple groups of parentheses separated by spaces, and the function is designed to determine the deepest level of nesting for each group.

To accomplish this, the function first splits the input string into individual chunks based on the spaces, which represent separate groups of parentheses. It initializes a counter and a nesting level variable for each chunk.

As it iterates through each character of a chunk, the function increments the counter for opening parentheses('(') and decrements it for closing parentheses(')'. When the counter reaches zero, it means the closing parenthesis matches the last opening parenthesis, and the nesting level is increased by 1.

Finally, the function returns a list where each element represents the deepest nesting level for each corresponding group of parentheses.

The example provided in the initial description demonstrates how to use the function with a string containing multiple groups of parentheses, and it outputs the correct result for that particular string.
