```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for bracket_pair_str in s.split():
        level = 0
        for char in bracket_pair_str:
            if char == '(':
                level += 1
            elif char == ')':
                level -= 1
            result.append(level)
    return result
```

The given Python script defines a function `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `s` as input, assuming it represents multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.

This function parses each group individually by maintaining a `level` counter that tracks the deepest level of nesting of parentheses. It iterates through each character of a given bracket pair string, increasing the `level` for '(' characters and decreasing it for ')' characters.

The function then returns a list of these nesting levels for each corresponding bracket pair group.

The example usage and test cases provided in the original problem statement illustrate how to call this function and verify its behavior against specific input scenarios.
