```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opening, closing in zip(*[iter(s.split())] * 2):
        depth = 0
        nested = 0
        while opening != closing:
            if opening == '(':
                depth += 1
            elif closing == ')':
                depth -= 1
            opening = closing if closing != ')' else opening
            closing = opening if opening != '(' else closing
            nested = max(nested, depth)
        result.append(nested)
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `s` as input. This string contains multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. The goal of this function is to calculate and return a list of the deepest levels of nesting of parentheses for each group.

To accomplish this, the function utilizes a loop that iterates over pairs of parentheses. It uses `zip(*[iter(s.split())] * 2)` to generate iterators over the two halves of the string split at the spaces, essentially providing alternating opening and closing parentheses.

For each pair of parentheses, it initializes two variables:
- `depth`: This variable keeps track of the current nesting depth. It is incremented for each opening parenthesis and decremented for each closing parenthesis. 
- `nested`: This variable keeps track of the maximum depth reached during the lifetime of the current pair of parentheses. 

The loop continues to iterate until the opening and closing parentheses are equal. At this point, the current depth is recorded in the `result` list, which eventually holds the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses.

Finally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains the maximum nesting levels for each group of parentheses in the provided string.
