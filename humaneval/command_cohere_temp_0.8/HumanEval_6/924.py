```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for token in s.split():
        open_bracs = token.count('(')
        close_bracs = token.count(')')
        result.append(open_bracs - close_bracs)
    return result
```

The code uses a simple approach to parse the string and calculate the number of open and close brackets `('')` for each token (substring separated by spaces). It keeps a count of open brackets and subtracts the count of close brackets to obtain the total nested levels, and appends this value to the result list. The final result list contains the maximum nesting level for each token. 

Such an approach is straightforward and works efficiently, but it is prone to errors if there are any discrepancies in the input strings, like unbalanced parentheses. 

To make the function more robust and avoid potential errors, we can take advantage of Python's ast module, which is designed for parsing Python expressions. This module allows us to easily parse a string expression and obtain its structure, including nested parentheses. 

Here is an example of how we can modify the function using the ast module:
```python
import ast

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for token in s.split():
        node = ast.parse(token)
        result.append(node.body[0].value.n)  # n is the number of nested levels
    return result
```

In this modified version, we use the ast.parse() function to parse each token (substring) separately as a Python expression. For each token, we obtain the corresponding ast node, and we extract the `n` attribute, which represents the number of nested levels, and append it to the result list. 

Using the ast module allows us to handle any complex input without the need to manually count open and close parentheses, providing a more robust and reliable solution.
