```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for i, char in enumerate(s.split()):
        cnt = 0
        for j, c in enumerate(char):
            if c == '(':
                cnt += 1
            else:
                cnt -= 1
            if cnt < 0:
                result.append(j)
                break
        if cnt > 0:
            result.append(i)
    return result
```

The code processes a string `s` containing several nested parentheses groups separated by spaces. It iterates through these groups, calculating the deepest level of nesting for each, using a nested loop that effectively traverses the string with indexing. It keeps a count of open parentheses `(`, incrementing it when encountered and decrementing when a closing parenthesis `)` is met. When the count drops to zero, it means the deepest level has been reached, and the index is appended to the results list. The index is also appended if the count is positive at the end of a group, indicating an open parentheses imbalance, which is legally valid. The resulting list of deepest nesting levels for each group is then returned.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
[2, 3, 1, 3]
```

This demonstrates that the function correctly identifies the deepest level of nesting for each group in the provided string.
