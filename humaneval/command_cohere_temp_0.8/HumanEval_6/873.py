```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(int, group.split())))) for group in s.split(' ')]
```

The provided Python script defines a function `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `s` as input. This string contains multiple groups of parentheses separated by spaces. The function's purpose is to extract the deepest level of nesting of parentheses for each group and return the results as a list.

The core of the function is a list comprehension that processes each group. It iterates over the groups using `sum(map(int, group.split()))`. This clever use of `sum` and `map` converts each group into a single integer that represents the total number of parentheses at different levels for that group. For example, the group "(()())" becomes `2`, and "(())()" becomes `3`.

The list comprehension then reverses this integer, divides it by 2 to focus on the deepest level of nesting (since each level doubles the count), and finds the maximum value using `max`. The result is a list of these deepest nesting levels for each group.
