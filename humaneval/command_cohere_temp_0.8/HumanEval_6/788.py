```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opener, closer in zip('(()')[::-1], '())':
        stack = [0]
        level = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == opener:
                stack.append(level)
                level += 1
            elif c == closer:
                level -= 1
                stack.pop()
        result.append(stack[-1])
    return result
```

The approach employed by the function `parse_nested_parens` is iterative and leverages the fact that '(' and ')' are symmetric pairs in the input string `s`. It traverses the string using a loop, maintaining a `stack` to keep track of the aggregate nesting level while toggling between '(' and ')' characters. For each '(' character encountered, the nesting level is incremented, and for each ')' character encountered, the nesting level is decremented. The maximum nesting level attained across all groups is returned as a list item.

To accommodate multiple groups of nested parentheses, the function additionally leverages the fact that the input string is traversed in reverse, allowing "group parsing" to occur in the correct order.
