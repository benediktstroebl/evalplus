```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for bracket_level in s.split():
        level = 0
        unbalanced = 0
        nesting_level = 0
        for char in bracket_level:
            if char == '(':
                nesting_level += 1
                unbalanced += 1
            elif char == ')':
                nesting_level += -1
                unbalanced -= 1
            if unbalanced > 0:
                continue
            if nesting_level > level:
                level = nesting_level
        result.append(level)
    return result
```

The approach involves splitting the input string into individual bracket sequences and then iterating through each sequence to count the number of '(' and ')' characters. The maximum nesting level is determined by the highest difference between '(' and ')' counts at any point in a sequence. This value is then appended to the results list, and finally, the list of maximum nesting levels for each sequence is returned. 

To better understand the approach, let's break down the code step by step:
1. **Splitting the Input String**: The input string is first split into a list of individual bracket sequences, where each sequence represents a separate set of parentheses. This is done using the `split()` method, which separates the string into discrete words on spaces.
   ```python
   result = []
   for bracket_level in s.split():
       ...
   ```

2. **Counting Brackets**: For each bracket sequence, the algorithm maintains two counters:
   - **nesting_level**: This counter counts the current maximum nesting level of parentheses within the sequence. It increases when we encounter a '(' and decreases when we encounter a ')' token.

   - **unbalanced**: This counter keeps track of the imbalance of '(' and ')' tokens. If the count of '(' tokens is larger than that of ')' tokens, the sequence is not properly closed, and we set the nesting level to 0 for such sequences.

   These counters are updated in each iteration of the inner loop.
   ```python
   level = 0
   unbalanced = 0
   nesting_level = 0
   for char in bracket_level:
       if char == '(':
           nesting_level += 1
           unbalanced += 1
       elif char == ')':
           nesting_level += -1
           unbalanced -= 1
       if unbalanced > 0:
           continue
       ...
   ```

3. **Finding the Maximum Nesting Level**: The `unbalanced` counter is crucial in determining the correct nesting level. If the count of '(' tokens is greater than the count of ')' tokens (`unbalanced > 0`), it means the sequence is not properly closed, and we skip this sequence by continuing the loop. This ensures that we only calculate the nesting level for valid sequences.

   Once the imbalance counter reaches 0, the algorithm checks if the current `nesting_level` is greater than the previous `level`. If it is, the `level` is updated to the current `nesting_level`.

   ```python
   if unbalanced > 0:
       continue
   ...
   if nesting_level > level:
       level = nesting_level
   ```

4. **Appending the Result**: Once all sequences in the string have been processed, the current `level` value is appended to the `result` list. This step essentially stores the maximum nesting level for each sequence in the input string.

   ```python
   result.append(level)
   ```

5. **Returning the Result**: After processing all sequences, the function returns the `result` list, which contains the maximum nesting level for each sequence.

   ```python
   return result
   ```
