```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(int, group), [])))) for group in s.split()]
```

The provided Python script demonstrates a function called `parse_nested_parens`, which takes a string (`s`) as input and returns a list of integer values. This list represents the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the input string.

To achieve this, the function utilizes a combination of integer conversion, summation, and maximum depth calculation within a list comprehension. It iterates through the provided string, splits it into distinct groups of parentheses, and for each group, it calculates the maximum depth of nesting. The depth is determined by counting the number of opening parentheses, adding an equal number of closing parentheses, and then calculating the maximum depth of nesting for the resulting sequence.

Overall, this function effectively solves the problem of determining the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the provided input string. It does so in a concise and elegant manner, demonstrating the power of list comprehensions and functional programming techniques in Python. The output of the function is a list of integer values, where each value represents the maximum nesting depth of the corresponding group of parentheses in the input string.
