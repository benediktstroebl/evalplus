```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for chunk in s.split():
        stack = []
        level = 0
        for c in chunk:
            if c == '(':
                stack.append(c)
                level += 1
            else:
                stack.pop()
                level -= 1
        result.append(level)
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string (`s`) as input. This string contains multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. The function calculates and returns a list of the deepest levels of nesting of parentheses for each group.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```python
>>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
[2, 3, 1, 3]
```

In this example, the output indicates that the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses is [2, 3, 1, 3], which means that the first group has a maximum depth of 2, the second group has a maximum depth of 3, the third group has a maximum depth of 1, and the fourth group has a maximum depth of 3.

The function achieves this by iterating through each space-separated chunk of the input string within a for loop. It uses a stack to keep track of opening parentheses encountered. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the stack is checked to determine the depth of nesting. The function increments the `level` counter when an opening parenthesis is added to the stack and decrements it when a closing parenthesis is popped from the stack. Finally, the function appends each `level` to the `result` list, corresponding to the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the given input string.
