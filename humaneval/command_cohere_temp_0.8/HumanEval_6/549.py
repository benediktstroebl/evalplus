Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem using a regex-based solution:
```python
import re
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    """Input to this function is a string represented multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.
    For each of the group, output the deepest level of nesting of parentheses."""
    patterns = s.split()
    depths = [re.findall(r'(\d+)', pattern)[-1] for pattern in patterns for r in [r'(\d+)', r'(\d+)']]
    return depths
```

This code uses `re` (Regular Expression) to match and extract the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the given string. It uses a nested list comprehension to apply the regex match to each substring of the input `string` that is separated by spaces, and returns a list of the deepest levels of nesting of parentheses for each group.

Here's how the code can be interpreted step-by-step:
1. Importing Required Libraries:
   - The code imports the `re` module, which is necessary for working with regular expressions in Python.

2. Function Signature:
   - 'def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]':
     - This line defines a function named 'parse_nested_parens' that takes a single argument 's', which is of type 'str' (string). The function returns a list of 'int' (integer) values.

3. Regular Expression Usage:
   - 'patterns = s.split()':
     - This line splits the input string into a list of substrings where each substring is separated by a space. These substrings represent different groups of parentheses.
   - 'depths = [re.findall(r'(\d+)', pattern)[-1] for pattern in patterns for r in [r'(\d+)', r'(\d+)']]':
     - This line uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in 'patterns' (a list of substrings).
     - For each substring ('pattern'), it uses the `re.findall()` function to find all occurrences of either '())' or '()' (parentheses with a number in them).
     - The '[-1]' index indicates that the last element (the deepest level of nesting) should be retrieved from the list of matches.
     - The result of this process is a list of the deepest levels of nesting for each substring.

4. Return Statement:
   - 'return depths':
     - The function returns the 'depths' list, which contains the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the input string.

The provided example test case demonstrates how to call the function and asserts that the returned list matches the expected results. Overall, this code uses regular expressions efficiently to solve the problem of finding the deepest level of nesting of parentheses in each group of the input string.
