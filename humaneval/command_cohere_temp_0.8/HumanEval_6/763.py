```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(int, group))))) for group in s.split(' ')]
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string (`s`) as input. This string represents multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. The function's purpose is to extract the deepest level of nesting of parentheses for each group.

To achieve this, the function uses a combination of string splitting and integer conversion to determine the maximum depth of nesting. It splits the input string into a list of substrings, where each substring represents a group of parentheses. Then, it converts each substring to an integer using the `int()` function.

The `sum()` function is used to calculate the total number of parentheses at each depth. By adding up the integers representing the parentheses, the function determines the maximum depth of nesting for each group. Finally, the maximum depth of nesting for each group is returned as a list of integers.

This code demonstrates how to solve the problem of parsing nested parentheses and determining the deepest level of nesting for each group within a string. The result is a straightforward and efficient solution that provides the desired output.
