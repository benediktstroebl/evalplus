```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opener, closer in zip('([{', ')]}'):
        stack = []
        level = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == opener:
                stack.append(level)
            elif c == closer:
                level = stack.pop() if stack else 0
            else:
                level += 1
        result.append(level)
    return result
```

The approach employed by the function involves treating each group of parentheses as a separate entity and utilizing stacks to keep track of the nesting level for each group. The function processes characters sequentially and adjusts the nesting level accordingly. When an opening parenthesis is encountered, it's added to the stack, incrementing the level. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the stack is checked, and if present, the level is decremented. In the absence of a stack (i.e., when encountering a closing parenthesis without a corresponding opener), the level is set to 0. The function ultimately returns a list of deepest nesting levels for each group of parentheses.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, since it processes each character exactly once.
