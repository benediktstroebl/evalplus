```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    forOpening, i, j = 0, 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '(':
            forOpening += 1
            j = i + 1
        elif char == ')':
            forOpening -= 1
            if forOpening > 0:
                j = i + 1
            else:
                result.append(j - i)
                i = j
        i += 1
    return result
```

The algorithm utilizes a counter `forOpening` that records the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses to determine the depth of nesting. A notch `i` and `j` is used to mark the start and end of a nested group respectively. The function returns a list where each element represents the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the provided string.
