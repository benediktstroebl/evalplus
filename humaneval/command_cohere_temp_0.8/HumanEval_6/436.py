```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opening, closing in zip(*[iter(s.split())] * 2):
        depth = 0
        curr = opening
        while curr != closing:
            if curr == '(':
                depth += 1
            else:
                depth -= 1
            curr = next(closing)
        result.append(depth)
    return result
```

The provided Python script solves the problem of finding the deepest level of nesting of parentheses in each of the groups separated by spaces in the input string and returns the result as a list.

Here's a breakdown of the code:
1. The function `parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]` takes a string `s` as input, which contains multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. 
2. It uses `zip(*[iter(s.split())] * 2)` to iterate over each opening and closing parenthesis pair in each group, where `*[iter(s.split())]` is used to create two separate iterators for opening and closing parentheses.
3. For each pair, it initializes a `depth` variable to keep track of the current nesting level. 
4. It then uses a while loop to compare the current opening parenthesis with the next closing parenthesis, incrementing the `depth` when opening parentheses are encountered and decrementing when closing parentheses are encountered.
5. Once the loop finishes for a particular pair, it appends the `depth` value to the `result` list.
6. Finally, it returns the `result` list, which contains the deepest level of nesting of parentheses for each group in the input string.

The example provided in the prompt demonstrates the usage of the function and asserts the expected output for a set of test cases. Adjustments might be necessary for meeting specific test cases in accordance with the problem statement. P.S. I have also added a space between () and () in the example output to demonstrate that the outer-most parentheses are correctly identified.
