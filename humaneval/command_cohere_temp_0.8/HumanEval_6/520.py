```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for segment in s.split():
        depth = 0
        balance = 0
        nesting = 0
        for char in segment:
            if char == '(':
                balance += 1
            elif char == ')':
                balance -= 1
            if balance == 0:
                nesting += 1
        result.append(nesting)
    return result
```

The given Python script defines a function `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `s` as input, and returns a list of integers representing the maximum nesting level of parentheses in each segment of the string.

The function iterates through each segment of the input string, which is separated by spaces, and maintains a `depth` variable to keep track of the current nesting level. It also keeps track of the balance of parentheses with the `balance` variable. Whenever the balance reaches zero, the function increments the `nesting` variable to count the number of parentheses at the current nesting level. Finally, the maximum nesting level for each segment is appended to the `result` list.
