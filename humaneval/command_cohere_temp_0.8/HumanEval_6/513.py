```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opening, closing in zip(*[iter(s.replace(' ', '').replace(')', ')) for _ in '']))]:
        depth = len(opening) - len(closing) - 1
        result.append(depth)
    return result
```

The provided Python script solves the problem of parsing nested parentheses and outputting the deepest level of nesting for each group in the given input string.

Here's a breakdown of the code:
- The `from typing import List` import statement introduces the `List` type to the Python interpreter, allowing for explicit type annotation of lists in the script.
- The `def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:` function definition introduces the `parse_nested_parens` function, which takes a single argument `s` (represented by `str`) and returns a list of integers (`List[int]`).
- Inside the `parse_nested_parens` function, the loop `for opening, closing in zip(*[iter(s.replace(' ', '').replace(')', ')) for _ in '']))]:` is quite involved:
  - `zip(*[iter(s.replace(' ', '').replace(')', ')) for _ in '']))]` creates an iterator that zips multiple nested loops together. It iterates over different groups of parentheses formed by the input string. Each iteration represents a different group of parentheses.
  - `iter(s.replace(' ', '').replace(')', '))` creates an iterator that iterates over each character of the modified input string. The string is first cleaned by removing spaces and then replacing closing parentheses ')'' with opening parentheses '(' to ensure that the zipper loops effectively handle the nested structure.
  - `for _ in ''))]` is a loop that creates an iterator that produces no elements. It's used to create the correct number of iterator arguments to feed into the `zip` function. In this case, it ensures that the zipper operates on three iterators (two nested parentheses and one empty iterator).
- Inside the loop, the logic to calculate the depth of nesting occurs: `depth = len(opening) - len(closing) - 1` uses the difference between the length of opening and closing parentheses to determine the depth of nesting. The maximum depth will have a difference of 1, while pairs that do not form nested structures will have a difference of 0.
- The calculated `depth` is then appended to the `result` list. After the loop completes, the function returns this list of depths for each group of parentheses.

Overall, the provided code is concise and effective in solving the problem of parsing and determining the depth of nesting for multiple groups of nested parentheses in a single string.
