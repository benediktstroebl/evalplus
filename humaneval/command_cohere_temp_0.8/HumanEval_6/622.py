```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(lambda x: list(zip(x, x[1:]))), [])))) for s in s.split()]
```

The provided Python script demonstrates a function called `parse_nested_parens`, which takes a string input `s` and returns a list of integer values. This function is designed to solve the problem of parsing nested parentheses and determining the deepest level of nesting for each group.

The main idea is to use `zip` to pair each opening parenthesis with the corresponding closing parenthesis, and then use `max` with `reversed` to find the deepest level of nesting (represented as the maximum depth of a recursive stack frame) for each group. The input string is first split into a list of substrings containing separate groups of parentheses. Then, for each substring, it calculates the maximum depth of nesting using the described approach. The function returns a list that has the deepest level of nesting for each group.

This solution is encapsulated in a self-contained Python script, which can be executed independently. Additionally, the code includes type annotations using the `typing` module to specify the input argument type and the return value type.
