```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opener, closer in zip('([{', ')]}'):
        stack = []
        level = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == opener:
                stack.append(level)
                level += 1
            elif c == closer:
                level -= 1
                stack.append(level)
        result.append(max(stack))
    return result
```
The function processes each group of parentheses separately, using two variables (`opener` and `closer`) to keep track of which characters to look for. It uses a `stack` variable to keep track of the nesting level while iterating over the characters of each group and adjusts the `level` variable as it opens or closes parentheses. After processing all characters, the `stack` is appended and the maximum value is used as the deepest level of nesting for the group. The function returns a list of these values for all groups. 

Here is an example usage of the function and its corresponding output:
```python
>>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
[2, 3, 1, 3]
```
