```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for segment in s.split():
        open_par = segment.count('(')
        close_par = segment.count(')')
        result.append(open_par - close_par)
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `s` as input. This string represents multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces. The goal is to calculate the deepest level of nesting for each group. The function splits the input string into segments using spaces as separators and then counts the number of opening and closing parentheses for each segment separately. It calculates the difference between the count of open parentheses and the count of close parentheses to determine the depth of nesting, which is the number of open parentheses minus the number of close parentheses. The result is a list of these nesting depths for each segment, representing the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses.

The given example input string and the expected output are provided as comments to demonstrate how the function is used and the manner in which it is intended to operate.
