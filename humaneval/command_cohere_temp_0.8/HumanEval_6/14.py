```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opener, closer in zip('(()')[::-1], '())':
        stack = [0]
        level = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == opener:
                stack.append(level)
                level += 1
            elif c == closer:
                level -= 1
                stack.append(level)
        result.append(stack.pop())
    return result
``` 

This code solves the problem by:
- Assuming that the input string `s` contains only nested pairs of parentheses represented by the characters `'('` and `')'`.
- Using the zipper `('(()')[::-1]` to iterate over the opening parentheses `('(', '(')` in reverse order while maintaining the correspondence with the closing parentheses `(', ')`.  
- Maintaining a stack (list) to keep track of the depths of nesting for each opening parenthesis. 
- Incrementing the top of the stack (`stack[-1]`), when an opening parenthesis is encountered, to keep track of the current depth of nesting.  
- Decrementing the top of the stack when a closing parenthesis is encountered. 
- Popping the stack until the deepest nesting level is reached and storing these values in the `result` list. 

The code is interpreted and can be run directly. However, to make it compatible with script execution and better illustrate the use of type hints, the code can be improved with the following adjustments:
```python
def main():
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod(verbose=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The script can then be executed using Python.

```bash
python <(')' * (i // 2) + '-' * (i % 2) + '(' * (i // 2) + '__init__.py')
```
