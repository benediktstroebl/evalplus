```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opener, closer in zip('(()', '))'):
        stack = [0]
        level = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == opener:
                stack.append(level)
                level += 1
            elif c == closer:
                level -= 1
                stack.pop()
        result.append(stack[-1])
    return result
```

The approach employed by the function `parse_nested_parens` is by tokenizing the input string `s` using the parentheses characters '(', ')' and then maintaining a `stack` of `levels` to track the nesting depth. The outer loop iterates over each character of `s`, and the inner loop parses sequences of parentheses.

Whenever an open parenthesis is encountered, its level is pushed onto the stack, and the nesting level is incremented. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the stack is checked for the most recent push (corresponding to the open parenthesis that initiated this sequence). The nesting level is then decremented, and if the stack is not empty, the deepest nesting level of any completed sequence is popped from the stack. This process repeats for every sequence of parentheses in the string.

The resulting list `result` contains the deepest nesting level for each sequence of parentheses in the input string `s`.
