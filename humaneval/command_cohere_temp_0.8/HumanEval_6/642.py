```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for segment in s.split():
        nest = 0
        imbalance = 0
        for char in segment:
            if char == '(':
                nest += 1
                imbalance += 1
            else:
                nest -= 1
                imbalance -= 1
            if imbalance > 0:
                result.append(nest)
                imbalance = 0
    return result
```

This script divides the input string into segments using spaces as separators, and then iterates over each character within each segment. When encountering an open parenthesis `(`, the `nest` counter is increased, while the `imbalance` counter is increased for each consecutive open parenthesis, and decreased for each close parenthesis `)`. The `nest` value is added to the result list when the `imbalance` counter is greater than zero, representing the deepest level of nesting for that segment. The script then returns a list containing the maximum nesting level for each segment. 

Here is an example usage of the code:
```python
>>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
[2, 3, 1, 3]
``` 

This demonstrates the function's ability to extract and report the maximum nesting levels of parentheses in each of the four segments.
