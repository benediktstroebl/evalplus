```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opener, closer in zip('(()')[::-1], '())':
        stack = [0]
        for c in s:
            if c == opener:
                stack.append(stack[-1] + 1)
            elif c == closer:
                stack.pop()
        result.append(stack[-1])
    return result
```

The approach employed in the function `parse_nested_parens` is iterative and utilizes a stack to keep track of the depth of nesting for each opening parenthesis. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, incrementing the top-of-stack (`stack[-1]`) by one when an opening parenthesis is encountered and decrementing it by one when a closing parenthesis is encountered. The final depth of nesting for a particular group is stored in the result list. The test example provided showcases the function's application on a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses, and the resultant list reflects the deepest level of nesting for each group.  This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of characters in the input string.
