```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for token in s.split():
        max_level = 0
        nesting_level = 0
        for char in token:
            if char == '(':
                nesting_level += 1
                max_level = max(max_level, nesting_level)
            elif char == ')':
                nesting_level -= 1
        result.append(max_level)
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string as input and returns a list of integer values. This function is designed to solve the problem of parsing nested parentheses in a given string.

The solution uses a simple algorithm that iterates through each token (a substring between spaces) in the input string. It keeps track of the current nesting level with `nesting_level` when it encounters an open parenthesis `(` and increases it by 1. When it encounters a close parenthesis `)`, it decreases the nesting level. The `max_level` variable keeps track of the maximum nesting level achieved during the iteration.

The function returns a list where each element represents the deepest level of nesting of parentheses for each corresponding group in the input string.
