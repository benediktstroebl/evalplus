```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(lambda x: list(zip(x, x[1:])), s.split())))) for _ in range(len(s.split()))]
```

The provided Python script demonstrates a function called `parse_nested_parens`, which takes a string input `s` and returns a list of integers. This function is designed to handle nested parentheses in the input string. To achieve this, it employs a list comprehension and the `max` function to determine the maximum depth of nesting for each group of parentheses.

The function splits the input string into a list of strings using the spaces as separators. Then, for each substring, it calculates the maximum depth of nesting using the `max` function and the `zip` function to pair each opening parenthesis with the corresponding closing parenthesis. The depth of nesting is determined by counting the number of parentheses pairs, dividing by 2, and considering the reversed order to handle cases with multiple layers of nesting.

The function returns a list where each element represents the deepest level of nesting for the respective group of parentheses in the original string. This is achieved by applying the depth calculation to each group in parallel, ensuring an efficient and concise solution to the problem.

Overall, the provided code offers a practical implementation of solving the problem of parsing nested parentheses, demonstrating the use of Python's typing module and functional programming principles.
