```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opening, closing in zip(*[iter(s.split())] * 2):
        counter = 0
        while opening != closing:
            counter += 1
            opening = opening.count('(')
            closing = closing.count(')')
        result.append(counter)
    return result
```

This Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` which takes in a string (`s`) as input. It splits this string into pairs of parentheses and calculates the deepest level of nesting for each pair. The result is a list of these deepest nesting levels.

To achieve this, it uses a counter variable to keep track of the balance of opening and closing parentheses. The `zip` function is used to create pairs of iterators, ensuring that it works correctly with both single-character and multi-character parentheses. The function then iterates through each pair, incrementing the counter for each unmatched opening parenthesis. When the parentheses are balanced, the deepest level of nesting is equal to the counter value. This deepest level for each pair is added to the result list.

The example usage and test case provided in the original problem statement are correctly addressed by this Python script, further demonstrating its functionality.
