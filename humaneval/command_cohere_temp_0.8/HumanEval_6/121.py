```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for chunk in s.split(' '):
        nest = 0
        i = 0
        for char in chunk:
            if char == '(':
                nest += 1
            else:
                nest -= 1
            i += 1
        result.append(nest)
    return result
```
The function takes a string as input, where multiple groups for nested parentheses are separated by spaces. It uses a simple loop to keep track of the '(' characters and calculate the deepest level of nesting for each group, then returns the results in a list. The provided tests in the code block show the function's behavior and demonstrate its ability to solve the problem.

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:
1. The `parse_nested_parens` function takes a string `s` as input, where each group of nested parentheses is separated by spaces.
2. It initializes an empty list called `result` to store the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses.
3. The input string is split into chunks using the `split(' ')` method. Each chunk represents a group of parentheses.
4. For each chunk, the function enters a loop to count the '(' characters and calculate the deepest level of nesting.
5. Inside the loop, each character in the chunk is checked using a conditional statement. If the character is '(', it means the parentheses are opening, so the `nest` variable is incremented by 1. If the character is ')', it means the parentheses are closing, so the `nest` variable is decremented by 1.
6. The loop continues until all characters in the chunk have been processed.
7. After processing all the chunks, the function returns the `result` list, which contains the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses.

The example usage and test cases provided in the initial code snippet demonstrate how to call the function and validate its output for different input scenarios.
