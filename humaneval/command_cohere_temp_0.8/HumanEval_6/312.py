```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    forOpening, forClosing = 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '(':
            forOpening += 1
        else:
            forClosing += 1
        result.append(forOpening)
        result.append(forClosing)
    return result
```

The approach for solving this problem is to count the opening and closing parentheses as we iterate through the string. The maximum count of opening and closing parentheses occurs at the deepest level of nesting and represents the output for each corresponding group in the input string.
