```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for segment in s.split():
        stack = []
        level = 0
        for c in segment:
            if c == '(':
                stack.append(c)
                level += 1
            else:
                stack.pop()
                level -= 1
        result.append(level)
    return result
```

This Python script defines a function `parse_nested_parens` which takes a string `s` as input. The function splits the input string into segments using spaces as separators. Each segment represents a group of parentheses that might have different nesting levels. The goal is to determine the deepest level of nesting for each segment.

The code uses a stack to keep track of opening parentheses encountered while subtracting closing parentheses from the stack to track the nesting level. The final nesting level for each segment is added to the `result` list, which is returned after processing all segments.

To understand the behavior of the code, let's take another example:
```python
>>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) Scouting ((()))())')
[2, 3, 2, 3]
```
This output shows that the segment `(()())` has a maximum nesting level of `2`, `Scouting ` has a maximum nesting level of `3`, and so on for the successive segments.
