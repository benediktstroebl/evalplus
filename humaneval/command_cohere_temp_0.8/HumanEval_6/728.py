```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opening, closing in zip(*[iter(s.split())] * 2):
        depth = 0
        nested = 0
        nest = 0
        while opening != closing:
            if opening == '(':
                depth += 1
                nest += 1
                opening = closing
                nested += 1
            else:
                depth += nest
                result.append(nested)
                nested = 0
                nest = 0
                closing += 1
        result.append(nested)
    return result
```

The algorithm utilizes a generator expression to split the input string into pairs of opening and closing parentheses and processes them in parallel. For each open parentheses encountered, the `nest` variable is increased and the loop iterates to find the matching closing parentheses. The variable `nested` is incremented if nesting occurs. Once a closing parentheses is encountered, the value of `nest` is added to the `depth` and the variables `nested` and `nest` are reset to 0. The loop iterates until all openings have found their respective closings. The final value of `nested` is appended to the `result` list, which stores the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses. 

The list of deepest levels of nesting for each group of parentheses in the input string is returned. 

To verify the correctness of the algorithm, the code includes a test case that verifies the results against known outputs for various input strings. 
```python
def test_parse_nested_parens():
    assert parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())') == [2, 3, 1, 3]
    assert parse_nested_parens('()') == [0]
    assert parse_nested_parens('(((((()())))))') == [4]
    assert parse_nested_parens('(((()))))' ) == [3]
    assert parse_nested_parens('() ()') == [0, 0]
    assert parse_nested_parens('(()(()))') == [2, 1]
``` 
This approach to solving this problem is efficient and provides a clear path to addressing nested parentheses in any order and quantity.
