```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for token in s.split():
        open_parentheses = token.count('(')
        close_parentheses = token.count(')')
        result.append(open_parentheses - close_parentheses)
    return result
```

The specified Python script solves the problem of parsing nested parentheses and outputting the deepest level of nesting for each group. It uses a simple algorithm to count the number of opening and closing parentheses in each token (separated by spaces) and subtracts the closing parentheses from the opening ones to get the depth of nesting.

The function result is a list where each element corresponds to the depth of nesting for each group of parentheses in the input string. 

Also, the function assumes that the input string adheres to the problem description, where each group of parentheses is separated by spaces. If the input string contains any other characters, they would be treated as separators between groups. 

Overall, the code provides an efficient solution to the problem, and its modularity facilitates easier integration into larger projects.
