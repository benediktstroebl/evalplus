```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(int, group), [])))) for group in s.split(' ')]
```

The provided Python script demonstrates a function called `parse_nested_parens`, which takes a string (`s`) as input and returns a list of integers. This function is designed to parse and analyze nested parentheses in the input string and determine the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses.

Here's how it works:
1. The function uses a list comprehension and the `sum` function to calculate the total number of opening and closing parentheses for each group.
2. The `map` function is used to convert each group into an integer representation, where `0` represents a closing parenthesis and `1` represents an opening parenthesis.
3. The sum of these integers is used to determine the deepest level of nesting for each group. The maximum depth is calculated by counting the number of opening parentheses and dividing it by 2.

This approach ensures that the maximum depth of nesting is correctly calculated for each group of parentheses in the provided string. The function outputs a list that contains the deepest level of nesting for each group separated by spaces in the input string.
