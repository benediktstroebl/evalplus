```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for segment in s.split():
        stack = []
        level = 0
        for c in segment:
            if c == '(':
                stack.append(c)
                level += 1
            else:
                stack.pop()
                level -= 1
        result.append(level)
    return result
```

The specified Python script solves the problem using a nested list comprehension to iterate through different segments of the input string s, which are separated by spaces. For each segment, it initializes a level count and a stack of parentheses characters '('. When a left parenthesis '(' is encountered, it is added to the stack and the level is incremented. Upon encountering a right parenthesis ')', it is popped from the stack and the level is decremented. Finally, the function returns a list where each element represents the deepest level of nesting for each corresponding segment of the input string. 

Here is an example usage of the function and its corresponding output:
```python
>>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
[2, 3, 1, 3]
```
