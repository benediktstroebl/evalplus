```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for i, char in enumerate(s.replace(' ', '')):
        if char == '(':
            nesting = 1
            while i < len(s) and nesting > 0:
                if s[i] == '(':
                    nesting += 1
                elif s[i] == ')':
                    nesting -= 1
                i += 1
            result.append(nesting)
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string as input. This string contains multiple groups of parentheses separated by spaces, and each group represents a different level of nesting. The function's purpose is to extract and return the deepest level of nesting for each group. It does this by iterating through the characters of each group, incrementing a `nesting` count for each opening parenthesis `(` and decrementing it for each closing parenthesis `)`. The resulting nesting count for each group is appended to a list called `result`. Ultimately, the function returns this list of deepest nesting levels for each group of parentheses in the input string.
