```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for chunk in s.split(' '):
        nesting = 0
        balance = 0
        for char in chunk:
            if char == '(':
                balance += 1
                nesting = max(nesting, balance)
            elif char == ')':
                balance -= 1
        result.append(nesting)
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `s` as input, where each character in the string represents a group of nested parentheses separated by spaces.

Here is a breakdown of how the `parse_nested_parens` function works:
1. The function iterates over each chunk, which is a substring of the input string `s` that is separated by a space. Each chunk represents a group of nested parentheses.
2. It initializes `nesting` and `balance` variables for each chunk. The `nesting` variable keeps track of the maximum depth of nesting, and the `balance` variable keeps track of the current balance of open parentheses `(` to closed parentheses `)`.
3. As the function iterates through each character of the chunk, it increments the `balance` variable if the character is an open parenthesis `(` and decrements it if it is a closed parenthesis `)`. Additionally, it updates the `nesting` variable to the current balance value whenever the balance increases, thereby updating the `nesting` variable to the maximum depth of nesting encountered so far.
4. After processing all characters in a chunk, the `nesting` value is appended to the `result` list. The `result` list will contain one or more integers representing the deepest level of nesting for each group of nested parentheses.

Here is an example of an input string and the corresponding output of the function:
```python
>>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
[2, 3, 1, 3]
```

The function will return a list where each element corresponds to the deepest level of nesting for each group of nested parentheses in the input string.
