```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for segment in s.split():
        nest = 0
        level = 0
        stack = []
        for c in segment:
            if c == '(':
                stack.append(c)
                nest += 1
                level = max(level, nest)
            elif c == ')':
                nest -= 1
                stack.pop()
                level = max(level, nest)
        result.append(level)
    return result
```

To understand the algorithm, let's break down the function using a simple example: `((()))`.

1. `result = []` initializes an empty list that will hold our results.
2. `for segment in s.split():` splits the input string `s` into individual segments using spaces as separators. In our example, this yields the segments `('((())', '(', ')')`.
3. `nest = 0` and `level = 0` initialize the current nesting level (`nest`) and the maximum nesting level found so far (`level`).
4. `if c == '(':` checks if the current character is an open parenthesis. If so, it increments the `nest` counter (how many open parentheses have been seen so far) and updates the `level` to the maximum of the current `level` and `nest` (i.e., whenever we encounter a new nesting level, update the maximum). It also appends the open parenthesis to the `stack` (a list to keep track of all open parentheses encountered so far).
5. `elif c == ')':` checks if the current character is a close parenthesis. If so, it decrements the `nest` counter (since a closing parenthesis means one less active nesting level), pops the last element from the `stack` (to match the closing parenthesis with its corresponding open parenthesis), and updates the `level` as described in step 4.
6. Once the loop finishes processing all characters in the segment, it appends the final value of `level` for this segment to the `result` list. The process is then repeated for the next segment.

After processing the example `((()))`, the `result` list will contain `[3]`, indicating that this segment has a maximum nesting level of 3.

Note: The Python interpreter automatically closes multiple nested parentheses, and leaves open parentheses if it doesn't have a matching pair to close. The described function only counts the maximum depth of nesting in the given string, without necessarily closing every open parentheses, hence the use of a stack to track open parentheses.
