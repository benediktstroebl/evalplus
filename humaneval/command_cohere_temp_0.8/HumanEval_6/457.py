```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opener, closer in zip('(()')[::-1], '())':
        stack = [0]
        for ch in s:
            if ch == opener:
                stack.append(stack[-1] + 1)
            elif ch == closer:
                stack.pop()
        result.append(stack[-1])
    return result
```

The approach employs a stack to track the depth of nesting for each opening parenthesis encountered. The string `('(()')[::-1]` provides the openers and closers in reverse order, allowing for iteration through the string with reversed lookup. For each opener encountered, the current depth is appended to the stack, while each closer is matched with the deepest opener, reducing the depth accordingly. The final depth is the last value in the stack, achieved due to the reversed order of iteration.

To better understand, let's break down an example:
 * Input: (**(**))
 
* iterations through openers and closers: ('(()', '())')

* looping through ch in s: 
  - '(' encountered, so [0, 0] -> [0, 1] is appended to stack
  - '(' encountered, so [0, 1] -> [0, 2] is appended to stack
  - ')' encountered, so [0, 2] -> [0, 1] is appended to stack
  - ')' encountered, so [0, 1] -> [0, 0] is appended to stack
  
* Resulting stack: [0, 0]

* Final result: [0, 0] which translates to the deepest level of nesting is 0 for this particular group

This approach allows the function to efficiently determine the maximum nesting level for each group in the provided string.
