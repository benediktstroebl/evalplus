```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for segment in s.split():
        stack = []
        for c in segment:
            if c == '(':
                stack.append(c)
            else:
                stack.pop()
        result.append(len(stack))
    return result
```

This code defines a function `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `s` as input. The function splits the string into segments using spaces as separators. Each segment represents a group of parentheses. The function then iterates through each segment, maintaining a stack of parentheses '(' and ')' using a list. When the opening parenthesis '(' is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack, and when the closing parenthesis ')' is encountered, it is popped from the stack. The function measures the depth of nesting by counting the number of '(' tokens pushed onto the stack before a ')' token is popped. This count represents the maximum depth of nesting for the corresponding group of parentheses. The function returns a list of these depths for each segment, which represents the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the input string. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
[2, 3, 1, 3]
```
This outputs of the function illustrate the deepest levels of nesting for each group of parentheses in the input string.
