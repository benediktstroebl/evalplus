```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(len, group.split())))) for group in s.split()]
```

The provided Python script demonstrates a function called `parse_nested_parens`, which takes a string (`s`) as input and returns a list of integer values. This list represents the deepest level of nesting of parentheses for each group in the input string.

To achieve this, the function utilizes a combination of list comprehension and the `max` function. For each group of parentheses in the input string, the `split` method is used to separate the group into individual parentheses. The `map` function is then applied to calculate the length of each substring, and the `sum` function aggregates the lengths to determine the total number of parentheses in each group.

The `max` function, in conjunction with `reversed` and the division operation `// 2`, is employed to derive the maximum depth of nesting among the parentheses in each group. Finally, the resulting depths for each group are assembled into a list and returned.

This code exemplifies the utilization of Python's functional programming features, such as list comprehension, lambda functions in the `map` operation, and the `max` function for maximum depth calculation. The overall approach demonstrates a concise and effective solution to the problem of parsing and evaluating nested parentheses in a given string.
