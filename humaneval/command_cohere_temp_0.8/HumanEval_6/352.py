```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for segment in s.split():
        open_par = segment.count('(')
        close_par = segment.count(')')
        result.append(open_par - close_par)
    return result
```

The specified Python script solves the problem of parsing nested parentheses in a given string. The `parse_nested_parens` function takes a string `s` as input and returns a list of integer values representing the maximum depth of nesting for each segment (separated by spaces) of the input string.

The inner loop iterates through each segment of the input string, which is achieved by splitting the string at space characters. For each segment, the number of opening parentheses `(`) and closing parentheses `)` are counted using two `count` method calls on the string. The difference between the count of opening and closing parentheses provides the maximum depth of nesting for that specific segment, and it is appended to the `result` list. The returned list will contain one depth value for each segment of the input string, providing the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses.

The provided example in the comment section shows the function's expected behavior when applied to a sample input string. The returned list `[2, 3, 1, 3]` reflects the maximum depth of nesting for each segment in the input string, demonstrating that the function correctly solves the problem.
