```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(len, group.split())))) for group in s.split(' ')]
```

The logic of the algorithm is as follows:
1. Split the string into a list of individual parentheses groups.
2. For each group, calculate the length of each substring representing a single parentheses group in the list and sum them up.
3. Reversed the sum result and divide each number by 2 to get the number of nesting levels since each nesting level is represented by a pair of parentheses.
4. Find the maximum nesting level among all the groups using the max function. 

This approach assumes that multiple parentheses groups are separated by spaces.
