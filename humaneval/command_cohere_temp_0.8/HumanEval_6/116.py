```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for chunk in s.split(' '):
        nest = 0
        i = 0
        for char in chunk:
            if char == '(':
                nest += 1
            else:
                nest -= 1
            i += 1
        result.append(nest)
    return result
```

The code processes each group of parentheses separately and calculates the deepest level of nesting for each group. The result is a list where each element corresponds to the maximum nesting level of the respective group. The overall time complexity is O(N), where N is the total number of characters in the input string.

To use this code, ensure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed. The `typing` module is a standard Python module included in the standard library from Python 3.5 onwards. If you are using a version older than 3.5, you may need to install the typing module separately. 

The function can be tested by calling it with different input values and verifying the returned values using the provided test case.
