```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for nested_parens in s.split():
        current_level = 0
        for char in nested_parens:
            if char == '(':
                current_level += 1
            elif char == ')':
                current_level -= 1
            result.append(current_level)
    return result
```

The given Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `s` as input. This string contains multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. The function splits the input string into a list of these nested parens groups and then iterates through each group, keeping track of the current level of nesting using the `current_level` variable. It increments the `current_level` when it encounters an open parenthesis '(' and decrements it when it encounters a closing parenthesis ')'. The result list is appended with the `current_level` for each group, representing the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses. The provided example and test cases illustrate how the function works and showcase its ability to accurately parse and output the deepest nesting levels for various input scenarios.
