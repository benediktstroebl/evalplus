```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opening, closing in zip(*[iter(s.split())] * 2):
        counter = 0
        while opening != closing:
            counter += 1
            opening = opening.count('(')
            closing = closing.count(')')
        result.append(counter)
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string (`s`) as input. This string contains multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. The function calculates and returns a list of the deepest levels of nesting of parentheses for each group.

The function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of pairs of matching opening and closing parentheses. It then iterates over these pairs and maintains a counter to track the deepest level of nesting. The counter increments whenever the opening and closing parentheses don't match, which occurs when encountering a deeper level of nesting. The result list is appended with the final count of each pair, representing the deepest level of nesting for that particular group of parentheses.
