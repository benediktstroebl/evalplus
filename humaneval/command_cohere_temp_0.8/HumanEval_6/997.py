```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(int, group), [])))) for group in s.split()]
```

The provided Python script defines a function `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `s` as input. This string contains multiple groups of parentheses separated by spaces, where each group represents a different depth of nesting. The function's purpose is to extract the deepest level of nesting for each group and return the result as a list.

The core of the function is a list comprehension that processes each group of parentheses. It converts each group into an integer using `map(int, group)`, which counts the number of opening parentheses `(` minus the number of closing parentheses `)`. The sum operation (`sum(...)`) flattens these counts into a single integer, and the `reversed` function is applied to correctly determine the maximum depth of nesting by counting from the inside out.

The result is a list where each element represents the deepest level of nesting for each respective group of parentheses.
