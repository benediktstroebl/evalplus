```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opener, closer in zip('([{', ')]}'):
        stack = [0]
        level = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == opener:
                stack.append(level)
            elif c == closer:
                level = stack.pop()
                if stack:
                    result.append(level)
            else:
                level += 1
        if stack:
            result.append(stack.pop())
    return result
```

The approach uses a counter to keep track of the nesting level for each group of parentheses encountered. The opening parentheses are used to increment the counter, while the closing parentheses are used to decrement the counter and check the previous value to determine whether it is the deepest level of nesting in that group. The output for the given example is `[2, 3, 1, 3]` as it corresponds to the deepest level of each group of parentheses.
