```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opener, closer in zip('([{', ')]}'):
        stack = []
        level = 0
        for ch in s:
            if ch == opener:
                stack.append(level)
                level += 1
            elif ch == closer:
                level -= 1
                stack.pop()
            result.append(level)
        result.append(stack[-1])
    return result
```

The algorithm utilizes a nested list `stack` to keep track of the level of each opening parenthesis encountered while iterating over the characters of the input string `s`. Whenever an opening parenthesis is encountered (`('(', '[' or '{{')), its level is appended to the list. Whenever a closing parenthesis is encountered (`(')', ']' or '}}'))), the last element of the list is popped and the current level is decreased. A level value of zero indicates no open parentheses at that depth.

The resulting list is flattened to a 1D list and returned. This flattened list contains the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the input string.
