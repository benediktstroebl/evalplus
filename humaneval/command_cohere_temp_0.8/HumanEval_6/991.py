```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(int, group), [])))) for group in s.split()]
```

The provided Python script demonstrates a function called `parse_nested_parens`, which takes a string `s` as input. This string `s` contains multiple groups of parentheses, separated by spaces. The function's purpose is to extract the deepest level of nesting of parentheses for each group and return the results as a list.

Here's how it works:
- The `parse_nested_parens` function uses a list comprehension to split the input string `s` into a list of substrings based on the spaces. Each substring corresponds to a group of parentheses.
- For each substring (group), the `map` function is used to convert the substring to an integer using the `int` function. This conversion step assumes that parentheses are represented by parentheses characters with odd numbers representing `(` and even numbers representing `)`.
- The `sum` function is then applied to the result of the `map` operation, which collapses the list of integers into a single integer representing the total count of parentheses in the group.
- The `max` function, when applied to the result of `sum` in reverse, determines the deepest level of nesting by counting the number of iterations needed to close all open parentheses until reaching the deepest nested level.

The returned list from the function contains the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the input string.
