```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(len, group.split())))) for group in s.split()]
```

The provided Python script defines a function `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `s` as input. This string contains multiple groups of parentheses separated by spaces, where each group represents a different depth of nesting. The function's purpose is to extract the deepest level of nesting for each group and return the result as a list.

The core of the function is a list comprehension that processes each group of parentheses. It uses the `split` function to break each group into individual parentheses, and the `map` function, in conjunction with `len`, counts the number of characters (parenths) in each split group. The `sum` function then adds up these lengths, providing the total characters for each group.

The comprehension's `reversed` function allows descending into the total character count, while the `i // 2` expression calculates the number of nested pairs of parentheses. The `max` function finds the maximum value of this count for each group.

Finally, the function returns a list that contains the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the input string.
