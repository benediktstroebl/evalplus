```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opening, closing in zip(*[iter(s.split())] * 2):
        depth = 0
        nested = 0
        idx = 0
        while opening != closing:
            if opening == '(':
                idx += 1
            elif closing == ')':
                idx += 1
            opening = s[idx:].find('(', idx)
            closing = s[idx:].rfind(')', idx)
            nested += 1
        result.append(nested)
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string input `s`, which represents multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.

This function calculates and returns a list where each element represents the deepest level of nesting for a particular group of parentheses. It iterates through the pairs of opening and closing parentheses and keeps track of the current depth of nesting `depth` and the total nested parentheses `nested` for each pair.

In each iteration, it uses string slicing and `find` methods to search for the next pairs of parentheses, incrementing the `depth` and `nested` counts accordingly. The result list is then created from the accumulated `nested` values for each pair of parentheses, representing the maximum depth of nesting for each group.
