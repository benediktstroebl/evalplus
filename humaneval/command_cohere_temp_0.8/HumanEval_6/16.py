```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opener, closer in zip('(()', '))'):
        stack = [0]
        level = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == opener:
                stack.append(level)
            elif c == closer:
                level = stack.pop()
            else:
                level += 1
        result.append(level)
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `s` as input, which is supposed to contain multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. This function calculates and returns the deepest level of nesting of parentheses for each group.

The core of the logic lies in the `for` loop, where each iteration processes one character of the input string `s`. The loop alternates between checking for opening and closing parentheses. When an opening parenthesis is encountered, the current depth level is incremented and added to the `stack` list. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the last depth level from the stack is popped and assigned to the `level` variable. In all other cases, the current depth level is simply incremented.

The resulting list of depth levels for each group of parentheses is then added to the `result` list, which is returned at the end of the function.

This code is type-checked using the `List` annotation in Python's type hints system, which helps ensure that the return type of the function is known and can be effectively processed at runtime. Also, the `zip` function is used efficiently to iterate over the opening and closing parentheses, reducing the need for manual iteration and making the code more concise and readable.
