```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for bracket_level in s.split():
        level = 0
        nesting_level = 0
        for char in bracket_level:
            if char == '(':
                nesting_level += 1
            elif char == ')':
                nesting_level -= 1
            level = max(level, nesting_level)
        result.append(level)
    return result
```

The specified Python script takes a string as input and returns a list of deepest nesting levels of parentheses in each of the groups separated by spaces. It achieves this by using a simple loop to track the maximum nesting level in each group. The maximum depth of nesting is calculated by counting the `(` and `)` characters and updating the maximum depth whenever a new maximum is found. It then returns the resulting list of maximum depths for each group. 

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of characters in the input string, and a space complexity of O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the state of the maximum depth variable.
