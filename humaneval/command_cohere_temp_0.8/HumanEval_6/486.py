```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for seg in s.split():
        count = 0
        level = 0
        balance = 0
        for char in seg:
            if char == '(':
                count += 1
                balance += 1
            elif char == ')':
                count -= 1
                balance -= 1
            else:
                continue
            if balance == 0:
                result.append(level)
                level += 1
            elif count == 0:
                level -= 1
        result.append(level)
    return result
```

The approach employs a straightforward loop to iterate through each segment of the input string and maintain a balance variable to track the overall balance of parentheses and a count variable to track the number of open parentheses encountered in a segment. The level variable is incremented when the balance reaches zero (i.e., a closing parenthesis is encountered, and decremented when the count reaches zero (i.e., an opening parenthesis is encountered). The results for each segment are appended to the result list.
