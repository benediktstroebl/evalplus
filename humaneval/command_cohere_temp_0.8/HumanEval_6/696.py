```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for bracket_string in s.split():
        count = 0
        curr = 0
        for char in bracket_string:
            if char == '(':
                curr += 1
            else:
                curr -= 1
            count = max(count, curr)
        result.append(count)
    return result
```

The given Python script defines a function `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `s` as input, assuming it represents multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces. It iterates through each of these groups, counting the deepest level of nesting of parentheses within each group. The result is a list of the deepest nesting levels for each group.

The script demonstrates how to solve the problem using Python and checks for correctness using a test case provided in the Problem Statement.
