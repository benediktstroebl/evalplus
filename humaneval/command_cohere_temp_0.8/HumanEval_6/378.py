```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for partition in s.split():
        level = 0
        nesting_level = 0
        for char in partition:
            if char == '(':
                nesting_level += 1
            elif char == ')':
                nesting_level -= 1
            level = max(level, nesting_level)
        result.append(level)
    return result
```

The approach involves splitting the input string into partitions and using nested loops to traverse each character. When we encounter an open parenthesis (`(`), we increment the `nesting_level`, and when we encounter a close parenthesis, we decrement the same `nesting_level`. Throughout the loop, `level` keeps track of the maximum nesting level encountered in each partition. Finally, we return the list of maximum nesting levels for each partition. 

To check the correctness of the approach, we can experiment with different input strings, comparing them with the expected output. Here is an example of how to use the function and test its output:
```python
>>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
[2, 3, 1, 3]
``` 
The output corresponds to the maximum nesting level for each group of parentheses in the input string, confirming the function's correctness. 

This approach guarantees a correct result for any valid input string. Additionally, the function is efficient because it has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, and a space complexity of O(1) as it does not require any additional data storage.
