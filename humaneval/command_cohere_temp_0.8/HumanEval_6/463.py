```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for i, char in enumerate(s.replace(' ', '')):
        if char == '(':
            nest = 1
            j = i
            while nest > 0:
                j += 1
                if s[j] == ')':
                    nest -= 1
                elif s[j] == '(':
                    nest += 1
            result.append(j - i)
        elif char == ')':
            result.append(0)
    return result
```

The specified Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens`, which takes a string input `s` that represents multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces. This function processes each group and calculates the deepest level of nesting of parentheses within that group.

The nested list `result` is used to keep track of the maximum nesting level for each group. The loop iterates through each character of the input string, and if the character is `'(''`, it initiates a nested loop to count the nesting level. For each opening parenthesis, the nested loop iterates until it encounters a closing parenthesis. It keeps track of the nesting level by incrementing and decrementing the `nest` variable. Once the closing parenthesis is found, the nesting level is appended to the `result` list. If the character is `')'`, a zero is appended to the `result` list to represent a closing parenthesis with no nesting.

The function ultimately returns a list where each element represents the deepest level of nesting for the corresponding group of parentheses in the input string.
