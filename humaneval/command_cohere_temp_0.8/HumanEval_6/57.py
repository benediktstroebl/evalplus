```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    forOpening, i, maxLevel = 0, 0, 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '(':
            forOpening += 1
            i += 1
            if forOpening > maxLevel:
                maxLevel = forOpening
        else:
            forOpening -= 1
        result.append(maxLevel)
    return result
```

The proposed function takes a string as input and returns a list of deepest levels of nesting of parentheses in each group separated by spaces. It uses a counter to track the opening parentheses and updates the maximum level of nesting whenever a parenthesis is encountered. Once the closing parenthesis is encountered, the maximum level of nesting is appended to the result list. It then returns the list containing the maximum levels of nesting for each group. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of characters in the input string, since it examines each character exactly once. It also has a space complexity of O(n) due to the counter variables.
