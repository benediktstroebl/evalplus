```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opener, Closer in zip('(()')[::-1], ')':
        stack = [0]
        level = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == opener:
                stack.append(level)
                level += 1
            elif c == Closer:
                level -= 1
                stack.append(level)
        result.append(stack.pop())
    return result
``` 

This code solves the problem by:
- Considering opening and closing parentheses as pairs and maintaining a 'stack' (list) to keep track of them.
- Iterating over the characters of the input string, 's', the opening parentheses are added to the stack, incrementing the 'level' when it's an opening parenthesis, and decrementing the level when it's a closing parenthesis.
- The deepest level of nesting for each group is then popped from the stack to form the output list.

The code maintains a single stack to handle all the parentheses groups, considering both the nested and separate groups to find the deepest level of nesting for each group in the provided string.
