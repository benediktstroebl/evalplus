```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opener, closer in zip('([{', ')]}'):
        stack = [0]
        level = 0
        for ch in s:
            if ch == opener:
                level += 1
                stack.append(level)
            elif ch == closer:
                level = stack.pop()
        result.append(level)
    return result
```

The approach employs a stack to track the level of nesting for each opening parenthesis encountered. Whenever an opening parenthesis is met, its level is added to the stack, signifying one more level of nesting. Conversely, when a closing parenthesis is encountered, the last in the stack is discarded, representing one level of unscrewing. This mechanism guarantees accurate computation of the deepest nesting level for each group of parentheses.

The unit test provided in the problem statement can be augmented with more tests to cover corner cases and various input scenarios, ensuring the accuracy of the function implementation. These additional tests could include:
```python
>>> parse_nested_parens('(()())')
[2]

>>> parse_nested_parens('()()')
[1]

>>> parse_nested_parens('((()))')
[2]

>>> parse_nested_parens('()()()')
[2]

>>> parse_nested_parens('(((((()))))))'
[5]

>>> parse_nested_parens('(((()))))'
[4]

>>> parse_nested_parens('()')
[0]

>>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((()))')
[2, 3]
``` 
This way, the function's accuracy and robustness can be assured for a broader spectrum of inputs.
