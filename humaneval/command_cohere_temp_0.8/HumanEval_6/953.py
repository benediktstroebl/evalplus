```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opener, closer in zip('([{', ')]}'):
        stack = []
        level = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == opener:
                stack.append(opener)
            elif c == closer:
                if stack:
                    stack.pop()
                    level += 1
                else:
                    result.append(level)
            elif c == ' ':
                if stack:
                    result.append(level)
                level = 0
        if stack:
            result.append(level)
    return result
```

The algorithm utilizes a nested list (stack) to simulate the behavior of parentheses nesting. 

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1. For each opening parenthesis `(` `[[{`, its corresponding closer is assigned (`])` `}]` and they are zipped together. This helps manage the nesting level for each pair of openers and closers.
2. A list `result` is initialized to store the deepest level of each group.
3. The main loop iterates through each character in the string. For openers, they are appended to the stack. For closers:
  - If the stack is empty, it means we've reached the end of a group, and the current nesting level is appended to `result`.
  - If the stack is not empty, a closer is popped from the stack, and the nesting level is incremented by 1.
4. A special case is added for spaces, where if a space is encountered and the stack is not empty, it means a new group is starting, and we append the current nesting level to `result`. The nesting level is reset to 0 for the new group.
5. After processing all characters, if there are still openers left in the stack, it means we've reached the end of the last group, and the current level is appended to `result`.
6. Finally, the `result` list is returned, which contains the deepest level of nesting for each group in the input string.
