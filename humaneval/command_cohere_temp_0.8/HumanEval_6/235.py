```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for container, curr_depth in enumerate(s.split(), 1):
        open_cnt, max_depth = 0, 0
        for char in container:
            if char == '(':
                open_cnt += 1
            else:
                open_cnt -= 1
                if open_cnt > max_depth:
                    max_depth = open_cnt
        result.append(max_depth)
    return result
```

The code processes each "container" (a substring separated by spaces) individually and keeps track of the current depth of parentheses within each container. It does so by counting the number of open parentheses (`('`) and updates the deepest level of nesting (`max_depth`) whenever it encounters a higher open parentheses count. The maximum depth of nesting for each container is added to the `result` list, which holds the answer for each group of parentheses. 

To achieve this, the code uses a `for` loop with the `enumerate` function which provides both the index `container` (which we use as a base indentation level) and the value `curr_depth` (which is a substring of the original string). Inside the loop, the code uses another `for` loop to iterate through each character of the `container`. It keeps track of the number of open parentheses (`open_cnt`) and updates the deepest level of nesting (`max_depth`) whenever it finds a higher open parentheses count. Finally, the maximum depth of nesting for each container is appended to the `result` list, which holds the answer for each group of parentheses. 

The code is structured this way to ensure that it is self-contained and easy to understand, following the requirements you provided. Let me know if you would like any further refinements to the code to accommodate other testing scenarios or code style preferences. I am happy to adapt the code snipppet based on additional specifications.
