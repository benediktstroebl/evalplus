```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for bracket_seq in s.split():
        curr = 0
        for char in bracket_seq:
            if char == '(':
                curr += 1
            elif char == ')':
                curr -= 1
            result.append(curr)
    return result
```
The provided Python script solves the problem of parsing nested parentheses and returns the deepest level of nesting for each group in the given input string separated by spaces.

The function `parse_nested_parens` takes an input string `s` that represents multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces. It iterates through each group of parentheses within the string, keeping track of the current nesting level using a counter `curr`. When it encounters an opening parenthesis `'('`, it increments the counter, and when it encounters a closing parenthesis `')'`, it decrements the counter. The results are then appended to a list `result`. Finally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses.
