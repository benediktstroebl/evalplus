```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opener, closer in zip('(()', '))'):
        stack = [0]
        level = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == opener:
                stack.append(level)
                level += 1
            elif c == closer:
                level = stack.pop()
        result.append(level)
    return result
```

The provided Python script implements a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string as input and returns a list of deepest levels of nesting of parentheses in each of the groups separated by spaces.

The function uses a `for` loop to iterate over each character in the input string `s`. It utilizes the `zip` function to iterate over pairs of opening and closing parentheses '(()' and '))' respectively. It initializes a list `stack` to keep track of the maximum depth of nesting encountered so far in a group and a variable `level` to keep track of the current depth of nesting. 

Inside the loop, for each character in the string, the program checks if it is an opening or a closing parenthesis. If it is an opening parenthesis, the `stack` is appended with the current `level`, and the `level` is incremented to represent that we've gone one level deeper into the nesting. If it is a closing parenthesis, the program retrieves the deepest level of nesting by popping the last element from the `stack` and updating the `level` to match.

After processing all characters in the string, the function returns a list of deepest levels of nesting for each group of parentheses.

The code includes type annotations with `from typing import List`, which are optional but provide better readability and help with static type checking tools. The function is designed to work with any string input and provides a versatile solution for parsing and measuring the depth of nesting in parentheses groups, as demonstrated by the included test case.
