```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(len, group.split())))) for group in s.split(' ')]
```

The logic of the algorithm is the following:
1. Split the string s into multiple groups of parentheses separated by spaces.
2. For each group of parentheses, convert them into a list of lengths of subgroups.
3. While subgroups are nested, their length contributes to a greater value of i in the sum. After the correction, the contribution of each subgroup is halved to correctly count the number of nesting levels.
4. Find the maximum nesting level among all subgroups by taking the maximum sum of contributions (i.e., maximum nesting level is the maximum integer divided by 2).
5. Return a list with the deepest level of nesting for each of the groups. 

The Python script is a self-contained markdown code block that takes a string s with nested parentheses separated by spaces, and returns a list of the deepest levels of nesting for each group of parentheses. The function uses the sum and max functions to calculate the deepest level of nesting for each group, and splits the input string into a list of values. The function then returns the list of deepest levels of nesting for each group.
