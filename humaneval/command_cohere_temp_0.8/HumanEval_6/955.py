```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(int, group), [])))) for group in s.split()]
```

The provided Python script demonstrates a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `s` as input. This string `s` contains multiple groups of parentheses, separated by spaces. The function returns a list where each element represents the deepest level of nesting of parentheses in its corresponding group. To achieve this, the function splits the input string into a list of substrings using the spaces as separators. For each substring (parentheses group), it converts it to an integer using the `int()` function and then sums these integers together. The sum operation effectively counts the nesting levels, with each opening parenthesis contributing a positive integer and each closing parenthesis contributing a negative integer. Reversing the sum result allows the maximum nesting level to be determined by finding the largest integer division by 2 (since each nesting level corresponds to twoOpening and two closing parentheses). The maximum nesting level for each group is returned in the resulting list of integers.
