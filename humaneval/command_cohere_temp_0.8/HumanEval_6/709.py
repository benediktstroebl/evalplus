```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(lambda x: list(zip(x, x[1:]))), [])))) for x in s.split()]
```

The provided Python script demonstrates a function called `parse_nested_parens`, which takes a string `s` as input. This string `s` contains multiple groups of parentheses separated by spaces. The function's purpose is to extract the deepest level of nesting of parentheses for each group and return the results as a list.

The function uses a list comprehension combined with the `sum` function to calculate the deepest level of nesting for each group. It iterates over the characters of each group, uses `zip` to pair them with their corresponding opening parentheses, and counts the levels of nesting using a counter. The maximum depth of nesting is obtained by dividing the counter value by 2 and reversing the list of depths to ensure the deepest level comes first. Finally, the maximum depth of nesting for each group is returned as a list.
