        stack = []
        for ch in bracket_seq:
            if ch == '(':
                stack.append(ch)
                unbalanced += 1
            else:
                if not stack or stack[-1] != '(':
                    unbalanced += 1
                else:
                    stack.pop()
                    nesting += 1
        result.append(nesting)
        assert not stack, f"Unbalanced stack remnants: {stack} after processing '{bracket_seq}'"
    return result
```

The code splits the input string into multiple sequences of parentheses via space separation. It then iterates over each sequence to keep track of the '(' characters and ')' characters via a stack to calculate the nesting level. The nesting level is incremented each time a '(' character is encountered and decremented whenever a ')' character is found. The 'unbalanced' variable keeps track of whether the bracket sequence is not properly balanced or not, with a positive value denoting an excess of either '(' or ')' characters.

The 'parse_nested_parens' function outputs a list of the maximum deepnesting levels for each of the input sequences of parentheses. It assumes that each sequence is properly balanced; if not, it will raise an assertion error. It's worth noting that this approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as it requires multiple passes through the string to extract each sequence of parentheses and determine their nesting levels. Additionally, the space complexity is O(m) where m is the maximum depth of any individual sequence, as the algorithm uses a stack to track nesting levels.
