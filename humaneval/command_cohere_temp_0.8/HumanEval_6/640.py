```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for bracket_level in reversed(s.split()):
        if '(' in bracket_level and ')' in bracket_level:
            result.append(bracket_level.count('('))
        elif '(' in bracket_level or ')' in bracket_level:
            result.append(0)
    return result
```

The specified Python script presents a function called `parse_nested_parens`, which accepts a string input (`s`) that represents multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces. This function processes each group independently and returns the deepest level of nesting for each group. The function achieves this by iterating through the characters in each group, counting open parentheses ('(') and incrementing the counter if a closing parenthesis (')') is encountered. Finally, the function reverses the resulting list to ensure the original order of groups and returns the count of deepest nesting for each group.
