```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for segment in s.split():
        nest = 0
        imbalance = 0
        for char in segment:
            if char == '(':
                nest += 1
                imbalance += 1
            elif char == ')':
                nest -= 1
                imbalance -= 1
            if imbalance > 0:
                result.append(nest)
                imbalance = 0
    return result
```

The proposed function takes a string as input and returns a list of deepest levels of nesting of parentheses in each segment. Each segment is separated by a space. 

The algorithm is a simple nested loop that keeps track of the '(' and ')' characters to calculate the deepest level of nesting for each segment. The function also ensures that if there is a remaining imbalance of '(' characters, the imbalance is reset to 0 and the current nesting level is added to the result before continuing to analyze the next segment.

This approach assumes that the input will not have any improper formatting, such as mismatched parentheses.
