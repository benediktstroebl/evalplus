```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(len, group.split())))) for group in s.split()]
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string (`s`) as input. This string contains multiple groups of parentheses separated by spaces. The function's purpose is to extract the deepest level of nesting of parentheses for each group.

To achieve this, the function uses a combination of list comprehension and the `max` function. For each group of parentheses, it calculates the length of each substring (assumed to represent a group) using the `len` function and sums these lengths using the `sum` function. By counting the number of parentheses pairs in each group, it determines the deepest level of nesting.

The result is a list of the deepest nesting levels for each group of parentheses in the input string. The function efficiently solves the problem and provides the required output.
