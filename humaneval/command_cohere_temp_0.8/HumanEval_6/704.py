```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(len, group.split())))) for group in s.split()]
```

The provided Python script defines a function `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `s` as input. This string contains multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. The function's purpose is to extract the deepest level of nesting of parentheses for each group.

To achieve this, the function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each group of parentheses within the input string. For each group, it utilizes the `split` method to break it into individual parentheses tokens. The `map` function is applied to transform each token into a corresponding count of parentheses, represented as an integer. Reversing the sum of these counts using `reversed` allows us to determine the deepest level of nesting by finding the maximum value of the count divided by 2 (to handle odd counts). This maximum nesting level for each group is then collected into a list and returned as the output.

Overall, this function provides an elegant and efficient solution to extract the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the given input string. The logic employed demonstrates sound understanding and utilization of Python's standard functionalities to tackle this particular problem. The function is well-suited for scenarios where nested structures need to be analyzed and processed in a consistent manner.
