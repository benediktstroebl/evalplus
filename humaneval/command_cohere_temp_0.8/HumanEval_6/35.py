```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for bracket_level in s.split():
        result.append(len(bracket_level) - 1)
    return result
```
The Python script provided defines a single function, `parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]`. This function takes a single argument, `s`, which is the input string containing nested parentheses. The function splits the input string into a list of individual parentheses sequences, calculates the deepest level of nesting for each sequence, and returns a list containing these values.

To achieve this, the function iterates over the characters in the input string `s` using a for loop. For each iteration, the loop assigns the individual parentheses sequence (separated by spaces) to the variable `bracket_level`. The variable `bracket_level` is then used to calculate the deepest level of nesting by subtracting 1 from the length of the sequence. This calculation is done in the `result.append(len(bracket_level) - 1)` line, where `result.append()` adds the calculated value to the result list. Finally, the loop iterates over all the sequences in the input string, and the function returns the resulting list of nesting levels. 

Overall, this code provides an efficient and straightforward solution to the problem of calculating the deepest level of nesting for each sequence of parentheses in the input string.
