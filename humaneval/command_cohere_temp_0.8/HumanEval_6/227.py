```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opener, closer in zip('(()')[::-1], '())':
        stack = [0]
        level = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == opener:
                stack.append(level)
                level += 1
            elif c == closer:
                level -= 1
                stack.pop()
        result.append(stack[-1])
    return result
```

The algorithm utilizes a nested list `stack` to keep track of the cumulative sum of open parentheses encountered. As we iterate through the string `s`, we use nested loops to carefully manipulate the stack based on the encountered openers and closers.

When an opener is seen, we push the current level of nesting onto the stack and increment the level. Conversely, when a closer is encountered, we reduce the nesting level and pop the last element of the stack, effectively undoing the effect of openers.

Finally, the deepest level of nesting of parentheses for each group is accumulated in the result list, and returned as the output.
