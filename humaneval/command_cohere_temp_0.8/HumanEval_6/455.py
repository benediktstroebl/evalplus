```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for bracket_seq in s.split():
        stack = []
        num = 0
        for char in bracket_seq:
            if char == '(':
                stack.append(char)
            else:
                num += 1 if not stack or stack.pop() != '(' else 0
        result.append(num)
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `s` as input. This string contains multiple sequences of parentheses separated by spaces, and the function is designed to extract and compute the deepest level of nesting for each of these sequences.

Here's how the function works:
1. It splits the input string `s` into a list of individual parentheses sequences using the `split()` method. Each element in the resulting list represents a separate sequence of parentheses.
2. For each parentheses sequence in the list, it initializes a stack (represented as a list) and a variable `num` to keep track of the deepest level of nesting.
3. The function iterates through each character in the parentheses sequence. If the character is `'(''`, it pushes it onto the stack. Otherwise, it increments `num` by 1, but only if the stack is not empty or the top of the stack is not `'(''`. The latter condition is to handle cases where the stack is improperly balanced, and increments num only for correctly nested parentheses.
4. After processing all characters in a sequence, the value of `num` represents the deepest level of nesting for that specific sequence, and it is appended to the `result` list.
5. Finally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains the deepest level of nesting for each of the parentheses sequences in the input string.

This solution efficiently processes each parentheses sequence in parallel, making it suitable for handling large and complex inputs while maintaining a reasonable time complexity.
