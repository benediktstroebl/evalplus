```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(int, group), [])))) for group in s.split(' ')]
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` which takes in a string (`s`) as input. This string represents multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. The function's output is a list where each element corresponds to the deepest level of nesting of parentheses in its respective group.

To achieve this, the function uses a combination of string splitting and integer conversion to determine the maximum depth of nesting for each group. It utilizes a recursive approach:
1. It splits the input string into a list of substrings using spaces as delimiters. Each substring represents a group of parentheses.
2. For each substring, it converts it to an integer using the `int()` function. This conversion results in a count of opening parentheses encountered, which can be used to infer the maximum depth of nesting.
3. The sum operation is applied to the counts, effectively summing up the opening parentheses counts for each layer of nesting.
4. The `max` function is used with the division operator (`// 2`) to determine the maximum depth of nesting across all layers. This is because the number of opening parentheses at each level is always twice the depth (e.g., ((())) is level 2, ()() is level 1, etc.).
5. The result is a list where each element corresponds to the deepest level of nesting for its respective group of parentheses.
