```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for segment in s.split():
        open_brackets = []
        clos_brack = 0
        for char in segment:
            if char == '(':
                open_brackets.append(clos_brack+)
            else:
                clos_brack += 1
        result.append(max(open_brackets))
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens`. This function accepts a single argument, which is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. It is tasked with extracting and returning the deepest level of nesting for each group.

The function begins by splitting the input string into individual segments using spaces as separators. It then iterates through each segment, maintaining a count of open brackets (`('`) and incrementing this count for every closing bracket (`) encountered. By doing so, it registers the deepest level of nesting for each segment.

The resulting integer values, representing the maximum nesting levels for each segment, are gathered into a list and returned by the function.

The example provided in the initial problem statement demonstrates the function's usage by parsing a string containing several groups of nested parentheses. The resulting list of integer values, [2, 3, 1, 3], signifies the deepest level of nesting for each respective segment.
