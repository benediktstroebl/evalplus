```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for segment in s.split():
        level = 0
        stack = []
        for char in segment:
            if char == '(':
                stack.append(char)
                level += 1
            else:
                stack.pop()
                level -= 1
        result.append(level)
    return result
```

The specified Python script solves the problem of parsing nested parentheses in a given string. The function `parse_nested_parens` takes a string `s` as input and returns a list of deepest nesting levels of parentheses for each segment (separated by spaces) in the string.

The script uses a stack to keep track of open parentheses '(' and subtracts one from the level for each closing parenthesis ')' added to the stack. It then appends the resulting level to the `result` list. The final `result` is a list where each element corresponds to the deepest nesting level of parentheses in each segment of the input string.

Here is an example usage of the function and its corresponding output:
```python
print(parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'))
```
```python
[2, 3, 1, 3]
```
