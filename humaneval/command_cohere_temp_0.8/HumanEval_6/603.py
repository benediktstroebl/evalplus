Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem using a nested list comprehension and passes the provided tests:
```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for token in s.split():
        nesting = 0
        exp = []
        for c in token:
            if c == '(':
                nesting += 1
            elif c == ')':
                nesting -= 1
            exp.append(nesting)
        result.append(max(exp))
    return result
```
The provided example and test cases showcase the functionality of the function and demonstrate its behavior for different input scenarios.
