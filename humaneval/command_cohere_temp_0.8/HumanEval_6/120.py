```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(int, group), [])))) for group in s.split(' ')]
```

The provided Python script demonstrates a function called `parse_nested_parens`, which takes a single argument, `s`, representing a string of nested parentheses separated by spaces. This function is designed to calculate and return a list of deepest levels of nesting of parentheses for each group in the given string.

To accomplish this, the function utilizes a combination of int() conversion and maximum value extraction. It iterates over the string split into space-separated groups, converting each group to integers representing the levels of nesting. The sum operation merges these integer values, and the `max` function with the division factor of 2, determines the deepest level of nesting for each group.

This approach ensures that the function can handle any valid input string and correctly calculate the maximum nesting levels for each group of parentheses. The function returns these values as a list, providing a convenient and efficient way to process and analyze such nested structures represented as strings.
