```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(int, group), [])))) for group in s.split(' ')]
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` which takes a string `s` as input. This string contains multiple groups of parentheses separated by spaces. The function's purpose is to extract the deepest level of nesting of parentheses for each group.

Here is an example:
```python
>>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
[2, 3, 1, 3]
```

In this example, the input string is `'(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'`. The function splits this string into four groups based on the spaces and calculates the maximum depth of nesting for each group. The result is a list of these maximum depths [2, 3, 1, 3].

The function uses a combination of string splitting, summing integers, and maximum depth calculation to achieve this. 

The `parse_nested_parens` function demonstrates how to efficiently process and extract nested patterns from string data in Python, making it a useful tool for handling similar challenges involving string patterns and numerical analysis.
