```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for interval in s.split():
        open, close = interval.count('('), interval.count(')')
        result.append(open - close)
    return result
```

The specified Python script solves the problem of parsing nested parentheses and returns a list of the deepest levels of nesting for each group in the input string.

This function takes a string as input and returns a list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting of parentheses for each group in the input string. The deepest level of nesting is determined by counting the number of opening and closing parentheses in each interval and subtracting the closing parentheses from the opening parentheses.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
[2, 3, 1, 3]
```
This will produce a list `[2, 3, 1, 3]` as the output, where each number corresponds to the deepest level of nesting for each group in the order they appear in the input string.
