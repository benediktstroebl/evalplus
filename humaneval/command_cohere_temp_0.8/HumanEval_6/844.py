```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(int, group.split(' ')))) 
             for group in s.split(' ') if group)]
```
This solution utilizes two sophisticated ideas:
1. The sum function to convert multiple-bracket strings to single expressions that count the depth of nesting.
2. Recursion unrolling (folding): The maximum depth of nesting for each group is calculated by the sum function, and then maximum depth over all groups is computed by the maximum function.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of each line of the provided solution:
1. `from typing import List`: This line imports the `List` module from the `typing` module. It allows us to define typed lists that provide additional type checking and validation when storing elements in them.
2. `def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]`: This line defines a new function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a single argument `s`, a string representing multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. It returns a list of integer depths of nesting for each group. The `-> List[int]` part indicates that the function returns a list of integers.
3. `return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(int, group.split(' ')))) for group in s.split(' ') if group)]:` This line returns a list of depths of nesting for each group. It uses several complex ideas to solve the problem:
    - `sum(map(int, group.split(' '))`: This part calculates the total number of parentheses at each depth for a single group. The `map(int, group.split(' '))` part converts each substring of the group into an integer that represents the number of parentheses at that depth. The `sum()` function then adds these integers together to get a single integer representing the total number of parentheses at each depth. 
    - `max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(int, group.split(' ')))) for group in s.split(' ') if group)`: This part takes the sum calculated above and finds the maximum depth of nesting. It does this by:
        - `max()`: This function takes an iterable and returns the maximum element in that iterable. In this case, it takes the list of integers returned by the `sum(map(int, group.split(' ')))` part.
        - `i // 2`: This part calculates the depth of nesting by dividing the index `i` by 2. When nested braches have depths of `(n)` and `(n(()))`, the depth of `(n)` is `n` while the depth of `(n(()))` is `n+1`. Therefore, dividing by 2 corrects the depth calculation.
        - `for group in s.split(' ') if group)`: This part of the line loops over each group in the input string `s`. It checks if each group exists (with the help of the `if` keyword in the `if group` clause), and then calculates the maximum depth of nesting for each group. 
        - `reversed(sum(map(int, group.split(' '))))`: This part reverses the list of integers returned by `sum(map(int, group.split(' ')))`, because the maximum depth of nesting will be the last element in the list, not the first. 

This solution is able to correctly parse the input string and
