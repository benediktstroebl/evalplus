```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for token in s.split():
        nesting = 0
        balance = 0
        for c in token:
            if c == '(':
                balance += 1
                nesting = max(nesting, balance)
            elif c == ')':
                balance -= 1
        result.append(nesting)
    return result
```

The specified Python script solves the problem of parsing nested parentheses in a string and determining the deepest level of nesting for each group. It provides a self-contained function `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a list of the deepest nesting levels of parentheses for each group.

Here's a step-by-step description of the code:
1. The function `parse_nested_parens` takes a string `s` as its input.
2. It initializes an empty list `result` to store the resulting deepest nesting levels for each group of parentheses.
3. The input string is split into individual tokens using spaces as separators.
4. For each token (representing a group of parentheses), it initializes two variables: `nesting` to keep track of the current maximum nesting level, and `balance` to keep track of the current balance of parentheses.
5. It iterates through each character of the token. If the character is `'(''`, it increments the `balance` and updates the `nesting` to the maximum of the current `nesting` and `balance`. This ensures that if a new depth of nesting is reached, it updates the `nesting` to that new depth.
6. If the character is `')'`, it decrements the `balance`.
7. After processing all characters in the token, it appends the `nesting` value to the `result` list. This `result` list will contain the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses.

The code uses Typing libraries to provide type annotations. The function `parse_nested_parens` has an input parameter of type `str` and an output parameter of type `List[int]`.

It includes a test case to validate the function:
```python
>>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
[2, 3, 1, 3]
```

The expected result for the test case is `[2, 3, 1, 3]`, which means that the first group has a deepest nesting level of 2, the second group has a deepest nesting level of 3, the third group has a deepest nesting level of 1, and the fourth group has a deepest nesting level of 3.
