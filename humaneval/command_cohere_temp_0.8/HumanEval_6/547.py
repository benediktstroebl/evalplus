The provided Python script solves the problem of finding the deepest level of nesting of parentheses in a given string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces.

The function `parse_nested_parens` takes a string `s` as input and returns a list of the deepest levels of nesting for each group of parentheses.

The approach uses a stack to keep track of open parentheses and checks each character against the stack to determine the nesting level. The loop iterates through each character of the string, and for each opening parenthesis encountered, it pushes it onto the stack. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the stack is checked to see if the last item matches the expected opening parenthesis. If it does not, it means there is an extra closing parenthesis, and the loop breaks to move to the next group of parentheses. Otherwise, the nesting level is incremented. If a special character like '(){}[],' is encountered when the stack is empty, it also breaks the loop to separate the groups.

Finally, the function returns a list of the deepest nesting levels for each group of parentheses in the order they appear in the input string.
