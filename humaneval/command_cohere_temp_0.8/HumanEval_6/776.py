                stack.pop()

                start = i

The `parse_nested_parens` function iterates through the input `string` and keeps track of the current nesting level for each opening parenthesis encountered. It does this by maintaining a `stack` of levels, where each element represents the deepest nesting level of parentheses encountered so far.

When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the function decrements the current nesting level, removes the corresponding level from the `stack`, and records the highest level reached during that stretch in the `levels` list.

To ensure we account for all parentheses groups, the function uses nested loops, iterating through the characters of the `string` and then switching between opening and closing parentheses.

Finally, the function constructs a `result` list where each element represents the deepest nesting level achieved in the corresponding parentheses group. It also adds a final element to indicate the starting index of each group, or the position of the first opening parenthesis of that group.

This solution efficiently determines the deepest nesting level for each group of parentheses in the provided string and returns the results as a list of integer values.
