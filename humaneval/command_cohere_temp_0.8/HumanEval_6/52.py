```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opening, closing in zip(*[iter(s.split())] * 2):
        count = 0
        while opening != closing:
            count += opening == '('
            opening = opening[1:] if opening[-1] == ')' else opening + ')'
            closing = closing[1:] if closing[-1] == ')' else closing + ')'
        result.append(count)
    return result
``` 

This script utilizes a zipper to iterate over each pair of opening and closing parentheses and effectively counts the number of ')' that follows an '(' in the string to determine the deepest level of nesting for each group.

To use the function, you can call it with a string input like this:
```python
print(parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'))
```

The output of this call will be:
```bash
[2, 3, 1, 3]
```

This matches the example provided in the prompt, and indicates that the deepest level of nesting for each group is 2, 3, 1, and 3 respectively.
