```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for segment in s.split():
        depth = 0
        unbalanced = 0
        stack = []
        for char in segment:
            if char == '(':
                stack.append(unbalanced)
                unbalanced += 1
                depth = max(depth, unbalanced)
            else:
                unbalanced = stack.pop() if stack else 0
        result.append(depth)
    return result
```

The approach employs a stack to track the difference between open and closed parentheses. When an opening parenthesis is encountered, its depth is tracked and the stack is incremented. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the stack is checked, and if it's not empty, it is decremented and the deeper of the current or the value in the stack is maintained. Ultimately, the function returns a list of the deepest levels of nesting of parentheses for all segments. 

To use the function, simply call it with a string containing nested parentheses separated by spaces:
```python
print(parse_nested_parens("(()()) ((())) () ((())()())"))
```

This will output:
```bash
[2, 3, 1, 3]
```

The expected maximum depths of nesting are provided at each parentheses group:
- `(()())`: This group has two sets of parentheses, achieving a maximum depth of 2.
- `((()))`: This group has three sets of parentheses, achieving a maximum depth of 3.
- `()`: This group has only one set of parentheses, and the maximum depth is 1.
- `((())()())`: This group has three sets of parentheses, achieving a maximum depth of 3. 

The function will return a list that reflects these depths for each segment.
