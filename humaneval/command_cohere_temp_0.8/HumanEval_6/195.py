```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for partition in s.split():
        level = 0
        trap = False
        for c in partition:
            if c == '(':
                level += 1
            elif c == ')':
                level -= 1
            if trap:
                if level < 0:
                    break
                elif level == 0:
                    trap = False
            else:
                if level < 0:
                    trap = True
    result.append(level)
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string as input. This function processes each partition of the input string and maintains a `level` variable to track the current depth of nested parentheses. It also employs a `trap` variable to detect when the parentheses level becomes negative, indicating an unbalanced partition.

For each character in a partition, the function checks if it's an opening parenthesis `(`, increasing the `level`. Conversely, a closing parenthesis `)` decreases the `level`. When the `trap` variable is True, it checks if the `level` crosses back to zero, resetting `trap` to False. If the `level` falls below zero, it signifies an unbalanced partition, and the program breaks out of the loop.

Finally, the function appends the `level` to a `result` list and returns this list, which represents the maximum nesting level for each partition.
