```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opener, closer in zip('(()', '))':
        stack = [0]
        level = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == opener:
                stack.append(level)
                level += 1
            elif c == closer:
                level -= 1
                stack.append(level)
        result.append(stack.pop())
    return result
```

The algorithm uses a zipper to match the opener and closer parentheses and maintain a stack (list) of the levels to retrieve the deepest level of nesting for each group. The list of deepest levels for each group is then returned by the function. 

Such an approach is among the most efficient ones to solve this problem as it doesn't require any additional preprocessing of the input string.

The zipper approach limits the algorithm's time complexity to O(n), which is essential because worse-case complexities are potentially exponential for nest-based approaches. 

The resulting time complexity is O(n), which is the same as the worst-case complexity of a recursive solution that uses a stack. Nevertheless, this solution has the advantage of being more understandable and easier to implement. 

This solution is also suitable to be converted into a parallel algorithm, where chunks of the string can be processed in parallel, which may provide an opportunity to improve performance for very large inputs.
