```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opening, closing in zip(*[iter(s.replace(' ', '').replace(')', '))').enumerate()]):
        depth = opening
        while closing != depth:
            depth += 1
        result.append(depth)
    return result
```
The code processes the input string s which is assumed to contain multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces, and calculates the deepest level of nesting for each group. It achieves this by iterating through each opening parenthesis, tracking the corresponding closing parenthesis, and incrementing a depth counter whenever the closing parenthesis lags behind the opening parenthesis. The result list accumulates these deepest nesting levels for each group. The overall time complexity is O(N), where N is the total number of parentheses tokens in the input string.
