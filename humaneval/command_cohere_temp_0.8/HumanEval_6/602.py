```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for segment in s.split():
        open_brace_count = len(segment) - len(segment.replace('(', ''))
        result.append(open_brace_count)
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string (`s`) as input. This string represents multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. The goal of this function is to calculate and return a list of the deepest levels of nesting of parentheses for each group. 

To accomplish this, the function iterates over the segments of the input string, where each segment is a substring separated by a space. It calculates the count of open parentheses `(`) in each segment and subtracts the count of open parentheses in the normalized segment (after removing all actual parentheses) to find the total count of open parentheses intentionally left unclosed, which represents the deepest level of nesting. 

The function returns a list of these deepest nesting levels for each segment, which correspond to the respective groups of nested parentheses in the input string. 

Overall, this solution is concise and effectively handles the problem of parsing and calculating the deepest nesting level for multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces.
