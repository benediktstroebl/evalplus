```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for chunk in s.split():
        nesting = 0
        unbalanced = 0
        for char in chunk:
            if char == '(':
                nesting += 1
                unbalanced += 1
            elif char == ')':
                nesting -= 1
                if unbalanced == 0:
                    result.append(nesting)
                    unbalanced -= 1
                else:
                    unbalanced += 1
        if unbalanced > 0:
            result.append(nesting)
            unbalanced -= 1
    return result
```

The proposed function takes a string as input and returns a list of deepest nesting levels of parentheses in each nested group. The `nesting` counter increments when the cursor is on an open parenthesis `(`, and decrements when it is on a close parenthesis `)`. The `unbalanced` counter increments whenever we encounter an open parenthesis without a matching close parenthesis, and decrements when we finally find the matching close parenthesis. The test case is also provided alongside the function for completeness.
