```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for bracket_str in s.split():
        level = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(bracket_str):
            if bracket_str[i] == '(':
                level += 1
            elif bracket_str[i] == ')':
                level -= 1
            i += 1
        result.append(level)
    return result
```

The given Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string (`s`) as input. This string contains multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. The function calculates and returns a list of the deepest levels of nesting of parentheses for each group.

To accomplish this, the function iterates over each group of parentheses within the input string. It initializes a level variable to 0 for each group and keeps track of the current nesting level by incrementing it when encountering '(' and decrementing it when encountering ')'. The function increments and decrements the level variable as it iterates over the characters in each group. Finally, it appends the achieved level to the result list, which holds the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses.
