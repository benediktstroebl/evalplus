```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for nested_parens in s.split():
        current_level = 0
        for char in nested_parens:
            if char == '(':
                current_level += 1
            elif char == ')':
                current_level -= 1
            result.append(current_level)
    return result
```

The given Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string as input. This string contains multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. The function calculates and returns a list of the deepest levels of nesting of parentheses for each group. It does so by iterating through each nested parens group and maintaining a `current_level` variable that keeps track of the current nesting level. It increments this level for each opening parenthesis encountered and decrements it for each closing parenthesis. The resulting list of current levels for each group is then returned as the output.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
[2, 3, 1, 3]
```
This example string has four grouped parens, and the function's output is a list [2, 3, 1, 3] which represents the deepest level of nesting for each of the four groups, respectively.
