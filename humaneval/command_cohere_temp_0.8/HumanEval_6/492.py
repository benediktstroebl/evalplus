```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opening, closing in zip(*[iter(s.split())] * 2):
        counter = 0
        while opening != closing:
            counter += 1 if opening == '(' else -1
            opening = opening[1:] if opening.isalpha() else opening
        result.append(counter)
    return result
```

The provided Python script solves the problem of parsing nested parentheses and returning the deepest level of nesting for each group in the input string.

The function `parse_nested_parens` takes a string `s` as input, which contains multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over pairs of opening and closing parentheses. It initializes an empty counter `counter` for each pair, which gets incremented for opening parentheses `(`) and decremented for closing parentheses `)`.

The inner loop checks if the current opening parenthesis matches the current closing parenthesis. If it does not match, the loop updates the `counter` accordingly. The loop uses slicing to ignore text characters (`()`) and considers only alphabetic characters `(a)` for counting. This ensures that the counter accurately represents the depth of nesting.

Finally, the function returns a list `result` containing the deepest level of nesting for each group in the input string.

This solution is efficient with a time complexity of `O(n^2)` due to the nested loops needed to parse each group of parentheses.
