```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for segment in s.split():
        stack = []
        for char in segment:
            if char == '(':
                stack.append(char)
            else:
                stack.pop()
        result.append(len(stack))
    return result
```

This Python script defines a single function `parse_nested_parens` which takes in a string as input and returns a list of the deepest levels of nesting of parentheses in each segment (separated by spaces) in the input string.

The function iterates through each segment, maintaining a stack of parentheses '(' characters and counting the depth of nesting. It does this by popping brackets from the stack whenever it encounters a closing ')' character and pushing openings '(' characters onto the stack whenever it finds a opening '('. For each segment, the function includes the number of elements in the stack, which corresponds to the deepest level of nesting of parentheses in that segment.

The given test case demonstrates the function by applying it to a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces and asserts that the result contains the expected deepest levels of nesting for each segment.

The code includes type annotations using Python's `typing` module, which are optional but can help provide better clarity and potentially improve code readability and maintainability, especially in more complex codebases.
