```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opener, Closer in zip('(()', '))'):
        stack = [0]
        level = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == opener:
                stack.append(level)
            elif c == Closer:
                level = stack.pop()
            else:
                if opener in c:
                    level += 1
                elif Closer in c:
                    level -= 1
        result.append(level)
    return result
```
The function processes each group of parentheses separately and uses a stack to keep track of the nesting level for each group. It iterates through each character in the string, adjusting the stack accordingly. When an opening parenthesis is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack, signifying the start of a new nesting level. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the topmost value is popped from the stack, representing the ending of a nesting level. Meanwhile, if an opening parenthesis is encountered in the string (indicating a deeper level of nesting), the current nesting level is incremented. Conversely, if a closing parenthesis is encountered, the nesting level is decremented to reflect the reduction in nesting. Ultimately, the maximum nesting level across all groups is returned as a list, fulfilling the problem's requirements.
