```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for segment in s.split():
        nest = 0
        balance = 0
        for char in segment:
            if char == '(':
                nest += 1
                balance += 1
            elif char == ')':
                nest -= 1
                balance -= 1
            result.append(balance)
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string (`s`) as input. This string is supposed to contain several nested parentheses groups separated by spaces. The function calculates the maximum nesting level of parentheses for each group and returns a list of these levels.

To achieve this, the function performs the following steps:
1. It splits the input string into segments using space as a delimiter. Each segment represents a nested parentheses group.
2. For each segment, it maintains a `nest` variable that keeps track of the current nesting level, and a `balance` variable to manage the current balance of opening and closing parentheses.
3. As the function iterates through each character of the segment, it increments the `nest` count for opening parentheses `(`, and decrements it for closing parentheses `)`. Additionally, it increments or decrements the `balance` accordingly.
4. The function appends the `balance` value (which corresponds to the maximum nesting level of parentheses for that segment) to the `result` list.

Finally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains the maximum nesting level for each group of nested parentheses in the input string.
