```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opener, closer in zip('(()')[::-1], '())':
        stack = [0]
        level = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == opener:
                stack.append(level)
                level += 1
            elif c == closer:
                level -= 1
                stack.pop()
        result.append(stack[-1])
    return result
```

The approach employed by the function involves treating each group of parentheses as a separate entity and utilizing a stack to keep track of the level of nesting for each group. The function achieves this by iterating through the characters of each group, adjusting the stack accordingly upon encountering opening or closing parentheses. Consequently, the final list element corresponds to the maximum depth of nesting for the respective group.

To retrieve the list of deepest nesting for each group, the function employs the `zip('(()')[::-1]` mechanism, which iterates through the characters of the reversed parentheses and produces a tuple of the opening and closing parenthesis characters. Subsequently, it iterates through the provided input string and repeatedly increments or decrements a counter based on the encountered opening or closing parentheses, ultimately saving the highest count achieved for each group.
