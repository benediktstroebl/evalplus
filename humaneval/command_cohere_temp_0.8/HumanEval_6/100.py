```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for bracket_pair in s.split():
        level = 0
        nesting_level = 0
        for char in bracket_pair:
            if char == '(':
                level += 1
            elif char == ')':
                level -= 1
                if level == 0:
                    nesting_level = max(nesting_level, level)
        result.append(nesting_level)
    return result
```

The given Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `s` as input. This string contains multiple groups of parentheses separated by spaces, and the function is designed to determine the deepest level of nesting for each group. The result is a list of integer values, where each integer represents the maximum nesting level for the corresponding group of parentheses.

To accomplish this, the function iterates through each group of parentheses using a loop. It keeps track of the current nesting level with the `level` variable, which increases for each opening parenthesis `(` and decreases for each closing parenthesis `)`. When the level reaches zero, the function records the current nesting level `nesting_level` as the maximum achieved within that group.

The function then appends these nesting levels to the `result` list, which it returns as the final output. The output will be a list of integers, where each integer represents the deepest level of nesting achieved within the corresponding group of parentheses in the input string.

This approach ensures that the function is self-contained and does not rely on any external variables or assumptions. It elegantly solves the problem of parsing and evaluating the nesting level of parentheses in a given string using a straightforward algorithm and intuitive logic.
