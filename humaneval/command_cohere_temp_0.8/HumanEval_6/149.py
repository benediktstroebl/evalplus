```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for bracket_str in s.split():
        level = 0
        for char in bracket_str:
            if char == '(':
                level += 1
            elif char == ')':
                level -= 1
            result.append(level)
    return result
```

The given Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string (`s`) as input. This string contains multiple groups of parentheses separated by spaces, and the function's task is to calculate the deepest level of nesting for each group. The function splits the input string into individual bracket sequences using the `split()` method. It initializes an empty list called `result`, which will store the deepest nesting levels of each group. Then, for each bracket sequence, it initializes a level variable to keep track of the current nesting level. It iterates through each character in the bracket sequence. When it encounters an open parenthesis `(`, the level is increased, and when it finds a closing parenthesis `)`, the level is decreased. The absolute value of the level is appended to the result list. Finally, the function returns the result list, which contains the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the input string.
