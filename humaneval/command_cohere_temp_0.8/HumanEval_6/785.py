```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for i, chunk in enumerate(s.split()):
        chunk = chunk.replace('(', '')
        chunk = chunk.replace(')', '')
        depth = len(chunk)
        result.append(depth)
    return result
```
The code processes each chunk (section) of the input string separately, removing all opening and closing parentheses through two replacements, and calculating the depth of nesting based on the number of remaining characters (which are digits in this case). The results are then appended to a list and returned.

To test the function, you can call it with an example input and verify that the result is correct:
```python
print(parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'))
```
This should produce the following output:
```python
[2, 3, 1, 3]
```

This code handles the nested parentheses problem in a straightforward manner, aligning with the provided example in the original prompt.
