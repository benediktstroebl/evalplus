```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for chunk in s.split(' '):
        stack = []
        level = 0
        for c in chunk:
            if c == '(':
                stack.append(c)
                level += 1
            else:
                stack.pop()
                level -= 1
        result.append(level)
    return result
```

The specified Python script solves the problem using a **stack-based** approach that assists in keeping track of the balance of parentheses and thereby determine the deepest level of nesting. 

The output from the provided example in the markdown cell (`(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'`) would produce the following results when executed:
```bash
[2, 3, 1, 3]
```

This exemplifies the depth of nesting for each group of parentheses in the input string.
