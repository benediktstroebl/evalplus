```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for tier in s.split():
        nesting = 0
        imbalance = 0
        for char in tier:
            if char == '(':
                imbalance += 1
            else:
                imbalance -= 1
            nesting = max(nesting, imbalance)
        result.append(nesting)
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string (`s`) as input. This string contains multiple groups of parentheses separated by spaces, and the function is designed to determine the deepest level of nesting for each group. The function splits the input string into different tiers and then iterates through each tier to count the imbalance of open and closed parentheses. It keeps track of the maximum imbalance reached, which corresponds to the deepest nesting level of parentheses for that tier. The results are then collected in a list and returned. 

To demonstrate the function's behavior, the provided example snippet inputs a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses, and the expected output, a list of integer depths for each group, is shown as well.
