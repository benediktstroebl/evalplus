```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(lambda x: list(zip(x, x[1:])), s.split())))) for _ in range(len(s.split()))]
```

The provided code works as follows:
- The code takes a string `s` as input, where `s` is a string represented multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.
- It uses `zip` to combine each open and closed parenthesis into a tuple, and `map` to transform each group of parentheses into a list of tuples.
- The `sum` function then concatenates all lists into a single list of tuples.
- Reversing this list, the code finds the maximum depth of nesting for each group by counting the number of pairs of parentheses, dividing by 2 (to get the depth), and picking the maximum depth for each group.
- The result is a list of these maximum depths, corresponding to the number of groups of parentheses in the input string.

The code ensures that each list within the output List has an element - this is achieved by adding a blank list `_` for the len(s.split()) - 1 times. I hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
