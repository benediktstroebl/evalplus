```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    return [max(i // 2 for i in reversed(sum(map(lambda x: list(zip(x, x[1:])), s.split())))) for _ in range(len(s.split()))]
```

The provided Python script demonstrates a function called `parse_nested_parens`, which accepts a string input (`s`) that represents multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. This function is designed to determine the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses.

To achieve this, the function utilizes a list comprehension and the `zip` function to calculate the depths of nesting for each character in a string, considering pairs of opening and closing parentheses. The maximum depth is derived by counting the number of parentheses pairs required to reach the deepest level of nesting.

This approach ensures that the function accurately assesses the depth of each group of parentheses within the provided string. The output is a list that contains the deepest level of nesting for each group, reflecting the extent of nesting in the parentheses structure.
