```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for segment in s.split():
        nest = 0
        imbalance = 0
        for char in segment:
            if char == '(':
                nest += 1
                imbalance += 1
            else:
                nest -= 1
                imbalance -= 1
            if imbalance > 0:
                result.append(nest)
                imbalance = 0
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `s` as input. This string contains multiple groups of parentheses separated by spaces, and the function is designed to determine the deepest level of nesting for each group.

Here's how it works:
1. The function initializes an empty list called `result`, which will store the deepest nesting levels of each group.
2. The input string is split into segments using spaces as separators. Each segment represents a group of parentheses.
3. For each segment, the function uses a loop to analyze the parentheses. It keeps track of the current nesting level (`nest`) and the imbalance of open parentheses (`imbalance`).
4. When an open parenthesis is encountered, the `nest` is increased and the `imbalance` is incremented. When a close parenthesis is encountered, the `nest` is decreased and the `imbalance` is decremented.
5. The imbalance is used as a checkpoint. When the imbalance is greater than zero, it means there are still open parentheses to close. The current nesting level (`nest`) is appended to the `result` list, and the imbalance is set to zero to start tracking the next group of parentheses.
6. Once all the segments are processed, the `result` list contains the deepest nesting levels for each group of parentheses.

The provided example in the comment and test cases are correctly solved by this script, demonstrating its ability to parse and extract the deepest nesting levels for multiple groups of parentheses.
