```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for segment in s.split():
        open, close = 0, 0
        for char in segment:
            if char == '(':
                open += 1
            else:
                close += 1
        result.append(open + close)
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string (`s`) as input. This string is expected to contain multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. The goal of this function is to calculate the deepest level of nesting for each group and return the results as a list.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```python
input = '(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'
result = parse_nested_parens(input)
print(result)
```

And here is the expected output:
```
[2, 3, 1, 3]
```

The function iterates over each segment (a subset of the input separated by spaces) and maintains two counters: `open` and `close`. When it encounters an open parenthesis `(`, the `open` counter is increased, and when it encounters a closing parenthesis `)`, the `close` counter is increased. The sum of `open` and `close` values at the end of each segment gives the deepest level of nesting for that segment.

The function returns a list where each element represents the deepest nesting level found in the corresponding segment of the input string.
