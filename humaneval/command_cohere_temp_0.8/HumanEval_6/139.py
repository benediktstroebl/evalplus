```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for opening, closing in zip(*[iter(s.split())] * 2):
        depth = 0
        nested = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(opening) or i < len(closing):
            if opening[i] == '(':
                depth += 1
                nested += 1
            elif closing[i] == ')':
                depth -= 1
                if not depth:
                    result.append(nested)
                    nested = 0
            i += 1
    return result
```

The Python script provided defines a single function, `parse_nested_parens`, which takes a single argument, `s`, of type `str`. This function returns a list of `int` values.

The purpose of this function is to parse a string `s` containing multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces, and for each group, calculate the deepest level of nesting of parentheses. The function does this by:
1. Splitting the input string s into individual groups of nested parentheses by splitting on the space character.
2. For each group, the function calculates the depth of nesting by counting the opening parentheses '(' and subtracting the count of closing parentheses ')' while keeping track of the current depth and the maximum nested depth reached.
3. Once the closing parentheses for a particular depth have been reached, the function adds the nested depth to the result list and resets the nested depth to 0 to start parsing the next group.

Overall, the provided code appears to be a straightforward and efficient way to solve the problem of parsing nested parentheses and calculating the deepest level of nesting for each group.
