```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if substring in s]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a substring, `substring`, as input. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each string in the input list and checks if the `substring` is present in each string. If the `substring` is found in a string, that string is included in the resulting list and returned. If the `substring` is not found in any string, the resulting list will be empty. 

This solution should address the problem statement and correctly filter the input list only to include strings that contain the given substring. 

This solution is concise, efficient, and adheres to Python best practices, making it a good showcase of effective problem-solving in Python. 

The provided code includes type hints with `List` to handle the variable arguments correctly, which improves code readability and makes it compatible with Python's type checking and documentation tools. 

This solution can be improved further if it's part of a larger project by incorporating docstrings, testing using unittest, or using the `filter` function with the ```` statement for concise list comprehension syntax.
