```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if substring in s]
```

This function takes a list of strings (`strings`) and a substring (`substring`) as input, and returns a new list containing only the strings from the input list that contain the given substring. It uses a list comprehension, iterating over each string in `strings`, and including it in the new list if it contains the `substring`. This solution adheres to the type hint `List[str]` for the input and output to ensure compatibility with Python versions that support type hints.
