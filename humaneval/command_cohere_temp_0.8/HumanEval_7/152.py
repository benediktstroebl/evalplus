```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    return [string for string in strings if substring in string]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a substring, `substring`, as input and returns a new list, `List[str]`, that includes only the strings from the input list that contain the given substring. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each string in the input `strings` list and checks if the `substring` is present in each string using the in operator. If the `substring` is found in a string, that string is included in the resulting list and returned. If the `substring` is not found in any string, the resulting list will be empty. 

This solution passes the provided test cases in the markdown code block, as it correctly filters the input list to include only the strings containing the given substring. 

This solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list `strings` since it iterates through each element once, and the in operation to check for substring occurrence has a constant time complexity O(1). 

This is a reliable and efficient solution for the problem of filtering a list of strings by a given substring.  It provides a clear and understandable implementation with strong typing using Python's typing module and uses list comprehension for concise and readable filtering.  It also has a reasonable time complexity for this common string matching operation.  It could be improved if needed to include more robust type annotations, documentation, and comments to explain the solution's underlying rationale and edge case scenarios it may or may not handle, but this would depend on the context and requirements of your specific use case.
