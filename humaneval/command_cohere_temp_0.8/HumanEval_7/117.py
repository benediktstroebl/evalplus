```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    return [string for string in strings if substring in string]
```

This function takes a list of strings (`strings`) and a substring (`substring`) as input, and returns a new list containing only the strings from the input list that contain the given substring. It uses a list comprehension, iterating over each string in `strings`, and including it in the new list if it contains the `substring`. 

This solution should address the problem statement and pass the given tests. Let me know if you'd like to discuss it further or provide any additional feedback!
