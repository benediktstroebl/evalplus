```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if substring in s]
```

This function takes a list of strings (`strings`) and a substring (`substring`) as input and returns a new list containing only the strings from the input list that contain the given substring. 

The Python for loop (also known as the for loop in Python) is used in the function to iterate over the list of strings (`strings`). Unlike many other programming languages that use the for keyword to specify a loop, in Python, this keyword is used to define what is running through the loop. The loop iterates over the items in the list, and each string is a potential candidate for the substring. 

The benefit of using a for loop makes code more readable and easier to write. This syntax is used to iterate through a sequence of elements (list, tuple, or string) or collections (dictionaries or sets). The loop iterates over each element in the sequence or collection, and the variable after the keyword ‘for’ is assigned the current item every time the loop is executed. 

In this case, the variable `s` is assigned the string from the `strings` list during each iteration. After iterating over all the strings in the list, the function returns a new list that includes only the strings that contain the `substring`. 

This Python script solves the problem and passes the tests. It is concise and uses list comprehension and the for loop to iterate over the input list and filter out the strings that do not contain the given substring.
