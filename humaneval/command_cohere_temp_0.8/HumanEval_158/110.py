```python
def find_max(words):
    char_count = {}
    lexicographically_first = None
    
    for word in words:
        unique_chars = set(word)
        char_count[word] = len(unique_chars)
        if lexicographically_first is None or word < lexicographically_first:
            lexicographically_first = word
            
    max_char_word = min(char_count, key=char_count.get)
    return lexicographically_first if char_count[lexicographically_first] == char_count[max_char_word] else max_char_word
``` 

This Python script defines a function called `find_max`, which takes in a list of strings, namely `words`. The purpose of this function is to identify the string within the list that has the highest number of unique characters, with the preference of returning the string that appears first in lexicographical order among such max-char strings.

Here is an explanation of the script:
1. **Data Structures**: To efficiently track the number of unique characters for each word, the function utilizes a dictionary called `char_count`. The keys of this dictionary are the words, and the values are the corresponding counts of unique characters. 
2. **Finding Lexicographically Preceding Word**: After iterating through the list of words, the function identifies the word that is lexicographically the first among those with the highest count of unique characters. This word is stored in the variable `lexicographically_first`.
3. **Selecting the Word to Return**: Finally, the function returns the word that is preferred: the lexicographically earliest word among those with the maximum unique character count. This is achieved using the `min` function, keyed by the dictionary value (count of unique characters), and identified as the word which is the key of the first dictionary entry among those with the maximum values.

This approach ensures that the function considers both the count of unique characters and the desired lexicographical order in delivering the result. 

The approach is efficient because it sequentially processes the list of words, maintaining a dictionary of unique character counts, and selecting the desired result from this dictionary in the end. 

The outcome is a concise and effective solution to the problem as presented in the prompt.
