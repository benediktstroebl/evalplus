```python
def find_max(words):
    max_dict = max(dict(zip(words, range(len(words))))[1]
                   for words in (set(zip(*[set(w) for w in words]))
                                for words in ((x,)*len(words))
                                for x in sorted(words, key=lambda w: len(set(w))))
    return max(words, key=lambda w: (-len(set(w)), w))[max_dict]
```

The problem is solved using clever generator expressions nested in a reducing max loop. Notice that within the generator expressions, we try to obtain the length of the unique set for each word within the list, taking into consideration the fact that the list might be multidimensional, in which case we just consider the set of unique characters of the first layer. Then, we lexicographically sort the words and try to maximize the previously obtained length of unique sets, subtracting from them the current word that we are checking. The first max subgroup yields the desired result. Let me know if youâ€™d like me to break down any part of the solution or provide a different approach!
