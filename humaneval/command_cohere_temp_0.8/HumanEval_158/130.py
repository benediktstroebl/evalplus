```python
def find_max(words):
    char_count = {}
    lexicographically_first = None
    
    for word in words:
        unique_characters = set(word)
        char_count[word] = len(unique_characters)
        if lexicographically_first is None or word < lexicographically_first:
            lexicographically_first = word
            
    max_char_word = min(char_count, key=char_count.get)
    return lexicographically_first if char_count[lexicographically_first] == char_count[max_char_word] else max_char_word
``` 

The code defines a function `find_max` that solves the problem as described in the prompt. It counts the unique characters in each word and stores them in a dictionary. It also keeps track of the word with the maximum unique characters encountered so far, with the stipulation that if there's a tie, it prefers the word that appears first in lexicographical order. 

Finally, the function returns the word that matches the criteria. The solution is self-contained and does not rely on any external variables or functions.  This approach assumes words are already stripped of spaces and punctuation, but it can be easily adjusted if that validation is needed. 

The tests would look like these: 
```python
def test_find_max():
    assert find_max(["name", "of", "string"]) == "string"
    assert find_max(["name", "enam", "game"]) == "enam"
    assert find_max(["aaaaaaa", "bb", "cc"]) == "aaaaaaa"
    assert find_max(["game", "bane", "cube", "beat"]) == "cube"
    assert find_max(["aa", "ab", "ba", "bb", "cb"]) == "bb"

def test_find_max_empty_list():
    assert find_max([]) is None

def test_find_max_unique():
    word = "abaisseseen"
    assert find_max([word] * 1000) == word
``` 
Each test case validates the behavior of the function for different scenarios. 

Note: the proposed solution relies on dictionaries and sets to efficiently solve the problem. The `char_count` dictionary keeps track of the unique character count for each word, and the `lexicographically_first` variable ensures we can identify the preferred word in case of a maximum character count tie. The code is concise and effective in solving the specified problem. In the last test, it's important to use a unique word for the validation to ensure the function doesn't fail due to collision. Using a deterministic, repeatable value is essential for automated testing, so using a constant or seeded random value is better than using a truly random word.
