```python
def find_max(words):
    char_count = {}
    lexicographically_first = None
    
    for word in words:
        unique_chars = set(word)
        char_count[word] = len(unique_chars)
        if lexicographically_first is None or word < lexicographically_first:
            lexicographically_first = word
            
    max_char_word = min(char_count, key=char_count.get)
    return lexicographically_first if char_count[lexicographically_first] == char_count[max_char_word] else max_char_word
``` 

This Python script defines a function called `find_max`, which takes in a list of strings, namely `words`. The purpose of this function is to identify the string within the list that has the highest number of unique characters, with the preference of returning the string that appears first in lexicographical order among such maximum character cases.

The function employs a dictionary named `char_count` to tally the number of distinct characters in each word. Alongside, it establishes a variable called `lexicographically_first` to retain the word with the lowest lexicographical order amongst the words having the maximum unique characters.

The function iterates through each word in the provided list, calculating the number of unique characters through the utilization of a `set` for character differentiation. The `char_count` dictionary is updated with this information.

Should a word possess the same count of unique characters as the `lexicographically_first` word, yet appear earlier in the lexicographical sense, it will become the new `lexicographically_first` candidate. This approach ensures that the eventual result will favor the lexicographically earliest word when multiple choices possess the same count of unique characters.

Finally, the function returns the word that possesses the highest count of unique characters amongst the entire list, opting for the `lexicographically_first` word if a tie arises.

This script ensures that words within the list are evaluated exhaustively, and the answer is optimized to offer the earliest lexicographically feasible word among words with the same unique character count.
