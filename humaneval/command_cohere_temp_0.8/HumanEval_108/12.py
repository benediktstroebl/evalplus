This Python script defines a function `count_nums` that takes an array of integers as input and calculates the number of elements in the array that have a sum of digits greater than 0. This summation of digits is performed using a generator expression, which iterates through the digits of the absolute value of the number and ignores '0's. The function then returns the count. This aligns with the problem statement's expectations, as mentioned in the docstring. The provided tests in the docstring also ensure that the function works correctly for the given input scenarios.
