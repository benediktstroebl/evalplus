This Python script defines a function `count_nums` that takes an array of integers as input and calculates the number of elements in the array that have a sum of digits greater than 0. The function iterates through each number in the array, counting positive digits and subtracting from the total if it's negative. The specification states that negative numbers are treated as their absolute value, with the first digit being the negative sign.

This solution passes all the test cases specified in the markdown code block, including edge cases like an empty array and different scenarios of positive and negative numbers.
