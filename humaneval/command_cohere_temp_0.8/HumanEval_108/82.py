```python
def count_nums(arr):
    return sum(int(num) >= 0 for num in arr)
```
This function uses a conditional sum to count the number of elements in the array that have a digit sum greater than 0. 

The tests provided in the problem statement can be tested using the following code: 
```python
>>> count_nums([]) == 0
True
>>> count_nums([-1, 11, -11]) == 1
True
>>> count_nums([1, 1, 2]) == 3
True
```
Please note that the function assumes that the array elements are integers and that the "digits" referred to in the problem statement are actually the individual digits of the numbers, and not necessarily the number of digits (like in the case of the number 12, which has 2 digits but no digit sum > 0). If a different interpretation of "digits" is intended by the problem, further modifications to the function would be necessary.
