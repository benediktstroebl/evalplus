```python
def count_nums(arr):
    output = sum(int(num) for num in arr if sum(int(d) for d in str(num)) > 0)
    return output
```
This function sums over all elements in the array `arr` and counts the number of elements where the sum of the digits is greater than 0. It does so by first converting the integer to a string, summing up the integers in the string representation, and returning `True` if that sum is greater than 0, and `False` otherwise. The final count is returned as the output of the function. 

Here is the full suite of tests corresponding to the problem statement:
```python
def test_count_nums_empty_list():
    """
    This test case ensures the function returns 0 when the input array
    is empty.
    """
    assert count_nums([]) == 0

def test_count_nums_negative_sum_digit():
    """
    This test case uses a list of integers, including one negative integer,
    to check if the function can correctly identify the number with a
    negative sum of digits.
    """
    assert count_nums([-1, 11, -11]) == 1

def test_count_nums_multiple_positive():
    """
    This test case uses a list of three integers, two of which have a
    positive sum of digits, to check if the function correctly counts
    all relevant integers.
    """
    assert count_nums([1, 1, 2]) == 3

def test_count_nums_large_array():
    large_array = [i for i in range(100)]
    large_array.append(1001)
    large_array.append(-1002)
    assert count_nums(large_array) == 3
```
This script provides test coverage for a variety of scenarios, ensuring that the `count_nums` function works correctly and aligns with the problem statement.
