```python
def count_nums(arr):
    nums = [int(i) for i in arr]
    count = 0
    for n in nums:
        if sum(int(d) for d in str(n)) > 0:
            count += 1
    return count
```

This function `count_nums` takes an array of integers as input and returns the number of elements in the array that have a sum of their digits greater than 0. The function achieves this by first converting each element in the array to an integer using a list comprehension. It then iterates through each integer in the list, and if the sum of the digits of the integer is greater than 0, it increments the count variable. Finally, the function returns the value of the count variable.

This solution is concise and efficient, as it utilizes built-in Python functionalities to solve the problem without requiring additional libraries. It provides a straightforward approach to calculating the number of elements in the array that meet the criteria of having a positive sum of digits. 

The function can be tested like this:
```python
import unittest

def test_count_nums():
    empty_array = []
    assert count_nums(empty_array) == 0

    array_with_positive_sum_digits = [1, 11, -11]
    assert count_nums(array_with_positive_sum_digits) == 1

    array_with_negative_sum_digits = [1, -1, 2]
    assert count_nums(array_with_negative_sum_digits) == 3

class TestCountNums(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_count_nums(self):
        test_count_nums()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

The test suite consists of two tests, one for an empty array and one for an array with positive and negative sum of digits. The `count_nums` function needs to be defined before the test suite for the tests to run correctly. When the test file is executed, it will verify that the `count_nums` function behaves as expected, confirming the problem's solution in the process.
