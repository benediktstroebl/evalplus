```python
def count_nums(arr):
    output = sum(int(num) for num in arr if sum(int(d) for d in str(num)) > 0)
    return output
```
This function sums over all elements in the array `arr` and counts the number of elements where the sum of the digits is greater than 0. The functionality is encapsulated within the `count_nums` function and does not rely on any external logic, making it self-contained and easy to use in different environments.
