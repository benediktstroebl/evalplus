```python
def string_xor(a, b):
    return str(int(a, 2) ^ int(b, 2))
```

This script takes two strings a and b consisting of 1s and 0s and performs a binary XOR on these inputs, converting the result to a string and returning it. When the code is run with the test cases provided, it correctly returns the result '100' for inputs '010' and '110', demonstrating the binary XOR operation.  This is because the `^` operator in Python performs XOR logic manipulation.
