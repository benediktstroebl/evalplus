```python
from typing import List

def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    return '__'.join(char ^ b for char in a for x, char in enumerate(a) if x ^ b)
```

The script utilizes Python's list comprehension and enumerate function in conjunction with the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) to perform the binary XOR operation on two strings `a` and `b`. The result is then returned as a string. 

To improve clarity, the `enumerate` function is utilized to obtain both the index `x` and corresponding character `char` during the list comprehension. This allows the XOR condition (`x ^ b`) to directly operate on the characters within the loop. 

The function finishes by returning the string result with any underscore characters (`_`) removed and combined into a single string `result` using string concatenation (`__`).
