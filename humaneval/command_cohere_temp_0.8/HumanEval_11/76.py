```python
from typing import List

def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    return '__'.join(c^b for c in a for b in '01')
```

The code uses Pythonâ€™s typing module to make the function more readable and feature proof. It also uses list comprehension to perform XOR on corresponding characters from the strings `a` and `b`. The `^` operator is used to calculate the bitwise XOR in Python. Finally, the function joins the resulting characters with the separator `__` to form a string and returns it. This approach results in an elegant solution with a time complexity of O(n^2) where n is the length of the given strings.
