```python
from typing import List

def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(chr(ord(x) ^ ord(y)) for x, y in zip(a, b))
```

This Python script defines a function called `string_xor` that takes two binary strings `a` and `b` as input. It uses `typing` to infer the types of the inputs and returns the result of the binary `XOR` operation between the two strings, which is also a binary string. This is achieved by using `zip` to pair the characters of `a` and `b`, performing character-wise binary `XOR`, and joining the resulting characters into a single string.

Here is an example of how to use this function to perform binary `XOR` on two strings using the example given in the prompt:
```python
>>> string_xor('010', '110')
'100'
```
This would return the result '100', as the corresponding bits of the strings differ.
