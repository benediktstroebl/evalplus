                result += '0'
        # Add extra 0s to a and b so we can use them as masks
        a += '0' * (len(b) - len(a))

```

This code defines a function called `string_xor` that takes two strings containing only ones and zeros as inputs. It performs a binary XOR operation on these strings and returns the result as a string. The function iterates through the strings, performing the XOR operation on corresponding bits, and adds '1' or '0' to the result string accordingly. To ensure that the mask is correctly aligned, extra zeros are added to the ends of both strings, and a mask is used to determine the positions where XOR is performed. The example usage and test cases provided in the docstring demonstrate the function's behavior, and the function's type hints ensure proper usage.
