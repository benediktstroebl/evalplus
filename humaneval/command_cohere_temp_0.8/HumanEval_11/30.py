```python
from typing import List

def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(chr(int(a_char) ^ int(b_char)) for a_char, b_char in zip(a, b))
```

This Python script defines a function called `string_xor` that takes two binary strings, `a` and `b` as inputs. It uses `typing.zip` to iterate over corresponding characters from both strings, calculates the XOR of corresponding digits using `^` operator, and converts the resulting binary string to ASCII characters using `chr` function. 

To ensure the function behaves correctly, it is accompanied by a test suite that checks the behavior of the function with a variety of inputs. If provided with two strings consisting solely of binary digits ('0' and '1'), the function returns the binary XOR of these two strings, also as a string consisting of '0' and '1'.
