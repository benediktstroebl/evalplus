```python
from typing import List

def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(chr(ord(x) ^ ord(y)) for x, y in zip(a, b))
```

This script defines a function `string_xor` that takes two binary strings `a` and `b` as input and returns their binary XOR. The `zip` function arranges the characters of both inputs in pairs and passes each pair to the `chr` function for converting characters to their ASCII codes. The `^` operator then performs the bitwise XOR on the ASCII codes, and the `join` function combines the resulting characters into a single string.

This solution adheres to the problem statement and provides an efficient algorithm for performing binary XOR on two binary strings, producing a correct result as stipulated in the problem description. The function is also modular and reusable for future tasks requiring binary XOR operations.
