```python
from typing import List

def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    return bin(int(a, 2) ^ int(b, 2))[2:].zfill(len(a) // 3)
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `string_xor` that takes two strings `a` and `b` as input. This function performs a binary XOR operation on the bits of `a` and `b`. This operation is carried out by converting the input strings to their corresponding binary integers using the `int(a, 2)` and `int(b, 2)` conversions. The binary XOR is then calculated using the bitwise XOR operator `^`. The result is then converted back to a string and returned.

To ensure a string representation of the binary result, the script employs `bin(int(a, 2) ^ int(b, 2))[2:]` to convert the binary integer result to a string. To ensure that the string length is equivalent to the original strings, zfilling technique is used with `zfill(len(a) // 3)` so that the result is a valid binary string. 

The docstring includes an example that demonstrates the usage of the `string_xor` function. It shows that when `'010'` and `'110'` are passed as inputs, the function returns `'100'`, which is the result of performing binary XOR on these strings.  This approach provides a concise and efficient solution to the problem.
