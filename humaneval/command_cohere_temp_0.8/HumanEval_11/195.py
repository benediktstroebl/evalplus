```python
from typing import List

def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(chr(int(a_char) ^ int(b_char)) for a_char, b_char in zip(a, b))
```

This Python script defines a function called `string_xor` that takes two binary strings, `a` and `b` and performs a binary `xor` operation on their corresponding characters, and returns the result as a string. The `typing` module is used for type hinting, a practice that helps make code more readable and maintainable, suggesting that the function takes two strings and returns a string. 

This solution leverages Python's string concatenation capabilities and the `chr()` function to convert numeric values to characters. The `zip` function is used to iterate over corresponding characters in both input strings. Inside a `for` loop, each pair of corresponding characters is subjected to the `xor` operation, with the resulting numeric value converted back to a character using `chr()`. This character is then appended to a growing string via the `join` method. 

This approach provides an efficient and concise solution to the problem of performing a binary `xor` operation on two strings and returns the result as a string. 

To verify the correctness of the implementation, the code includes a test case in the function docstring that returns the expected result via the `>>>` syntax, indicating that the test is successful.
