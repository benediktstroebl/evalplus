```python
def anti_shuffle(s):
    word_array = s.split()
    new_word_array = []
    for word in word_array:
        ascii_ordered = ''.join(sorted(word))
        new_word_array.append(ascii_ordered)
    return ' '.join(new_word_array)
```

This approach first splits the entire string into words (assuming words are separated by spaces) and then sorts each word based on the ascii value of its characters, thus, arranging them in ascending order. The joined string is then returned as the answer.

This solution ranks among the more efficient ones since it doesn't invoke any external libraries and only uses functionalities inherent to the language. Also, the time complexity of sorting operations (which involves an O(n log n) sortation algorithm) is usually considered efficient for most practical applications.

If the input consists of oddly behaving characters (like Chinese, Japanese, or Korean characters) that sort differently than intended, due to the ASCII order, this approach may produce tainted results. However, such cases are typically exempt from the problem statement and thus aren't considered practical viewpoints.
