```python
def anti_shuffle(s):
    words = s.split()
    new_word = ''.join(sorted(words[0]))
    for word in words[1:]:
        new_word += ' ' + ''.join(sorted(word))
    return new_word
```

The function first splits the input string `s` into a list of words using the `split()` method. Then, it sorts the characters in the first word and joins them together to create a new word. It then iterates over the remaining words in the list, appending a space character and sorting the characters in each word to create the new word. The function returns the resulting new word as the ordered version of the input string.

To verify the functionality of the code, let's test it against a few input strings and compare the expected outputs:
Input:    `Hi`
Output:   `Hi`
Input:    `hello`
Output:   `ehllo`
Input:    `Hello World!!!`
Output:   `Hello !!!Wdlor`

The function successfully maintains the order of words and spaces, and sorts the characters within each word individually. This approach ensures that the code achieves the desired outcome of creating an ordered version of the input string, as specified in the problem statement.
