```python
def anti_shuffle(s):
    word_array = s.split()
    new_word_array = []
    for word in word_array:
        ascii_sorted = ''.join(sorted(word))
        new_word_array.append(ascii_sorted)
    return ' '.join(new_word_array)
```

This approach first splits the entire string into words (using split() function), then sorts each word individually based on ASCII values, and finally joins them back to form the required ordered string.
