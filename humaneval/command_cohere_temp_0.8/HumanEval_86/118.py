```python
def anti_shuffle(s):
    word_array = s.split()
    new_word_array = []
    for word in word_array:
        ascii_sorted = ''.join(sorted(word))
        new_word_array.append(ascii_sorted)
    return ' '.join(new_word_array)
```

This approach takes the input string, splits it into words using the `split()` method (considering spaces as separators), and then sorts the characters in each word individually and sequentially to construct a new word. It then reunites these new words with spaces to form the `new_string`. The resulting string retains the original word order and spacing but with the rearranged letter order in each word. 

To test this function, you can run the following code:
```python
antishuffle_func = __import__('antishuffle_func')

print(antishuffle_func.anti_shuffle("Hi"))
print(antishuffle_func.anti_shuffle("hello"))
print(antishuffle_func.anti_shuffle("Hello World!!!"))
```

This should yield the following output:
```
Hi
ehllo
Hello !!!Wdlor
```

This approach ensures a correct implementation of the ordered string transformation based on the provided problem statement. Let me know if this assists in solving your use case or if you'd like further clarification!
