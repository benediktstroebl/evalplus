Here's a Python script that contains a function called anti_shuffle, defined as follows:
```python
def anti_shuffle(s):
    words = s.split()
    new_word = ''.join(sorted(words[0]))
    for word in words[1:]:
        new_word += ' ' + ''.join(sorted(word))
    return new_word
```
This function accepts a string s as input and processes it as directed in the problem statement. It splits the input string into individual words and then constructs a new word, which will replace each word in the original string, by concatenating the sorted characters of each word, leaving the order of words and spaces unaffected. This is achieved using the split() method to divide the string into a list of words and an empty string, ''.join(sorted(words[0])) to merge the characters of the first word, in ascending order. This process is repeated for each word in the list, with the leading space serving as a blank space in the new string. Ultimately, the function returns the new word that is to replace the original words in order to create an ordered version of the string. 

Here's an example of how you can use this function to solve the problem:
```python
def test_anti_shuffle():
    # Example 1
    input_str = "Hi"
    expected = "Hi"
    result = anti_shuffle(input_str)
    assert result == expected

    # Example 2
    input_str = "hello"
    expected = "ehllo"
    result = anti_shuffle(input_str)
    assert result == expected

    # Example 3
    input_str = "Hello World!!!"
    expected = "Hello !!!Wdlor"
    result = anti_shuffle(input_str)
    assert result == expected

test_anti_shuffle()
```
This test code validates the function by applying it to three different inputs and comparing its output with the expected result using the assert statement. The test is successful if the comparison fails, indicating that the function behaves as expected.  This is a basic but effective method for confirming that the function operates correctly.

When the test is executed, the anti_shuffle function is called three times with the corresponding inputs from the test suite, and the results are compared to the anticipated values. If all assertions pass, indicating that the function performs as expected, the test execution will be successful.  This test suite provides a good degree of confidence in the function's correctness, but for more comprehensive and robust testing, it is often advisable to consider a wider range of inputs and edge cases. 

This script can be executed by pressing the "Run" button or by adding a command-line execution at the end of the script like this:
```python
test_anti_shuffle()
``` 
This command will run the test_anti_shuffle function, which will execute the function with the three test cases and compare the output to the expected output using the assert statement. If the outputs match the expected outputs, then the test will pass; otherwise, it will fail, providing feedback on the performance of the anti_shuffle function.  This will allow you to validate the correctness of the function.  In addition, you can also implement other test cases to match your specific needs and further increase the function's reliability.  This approach could be especially helpful for avoiding issues in functions related to varying input requirements or interpretations.  By creating tests for different use cases, you can have confidence in the consistent performance of this function.  This is essential to establish a reliable testing and development workflow when dealing with functions handling strings and words.  Such a workflow ultimately helps create more robust and dependable code
