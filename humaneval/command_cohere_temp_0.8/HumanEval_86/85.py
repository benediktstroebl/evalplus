```python
def anti_shuffle(s):
    word_array = s.split()
    new_word_array = []
    for word in word_array:
        ascii_sorted = ''.join(sorted(word))
        new_word_array.append(ascii_sorted)
    return ' '.join(new_word_array)
```

This Python script defines a function `anti_shuffle` that takes a string as an input and returns a sorted version of the string. In the function, the input string is split into a list of words and stored in the `word_array` variable. Then, a new empty list `new_word_array` is created to store the sorted version of each word. Using a for loop, each word in `word_array` is iterated through, and the characters in each word are sorted by their ASCII value. The sorted word is then appended to `new_word_array`. Finally, the function returns a string created by joining the elements of the `new_word_array` list together while keeping the original spaces between the words, effectively returning the ordered version of the input string. 

Here is an example function call:
```python
print(anti_shuffle("Hello World!!!")) # output: "Hello !!!Wdlor"
```

This will output the ordered version of the string "Hello World!!!", where the characters in each word are sorted by their ASCII values, and the order of words and spaces are kept intact. 

The code is encapsulated in a self-contained Python script that can be executed independently. It also includes an example usage in the comment to demonstrate how to use the function and shows the output.
