```python
def anti_shuffle(s):
    words = s.split()
    new_word = ''.join(sorted(words[0]))
    for word in words[1:]:
        new_word += ' ' + ''.join(sorted(word))
    return new_word
```

The function `anti_shuffle` takes a string as input and returns an ordered version of the string as described in the prompt. It splits the input string into words separated by spaces. Then, for the first word, it concatenates the sorted characters together to form a new word. It repeats this process for each subsequent word, adding them to the new word with a space in between. The resulting new word is returned as the ordered version of the input string.

```python
def test_anti_shuffle():
    assert anti_shuffle("Hi") == "Hi"
    assert anti_shuffle("hello") == "ehllo"
    assert anti_shuffle("Hello World!!!") == "Hello !!!Wdlor"
```

This is a test suite with three test functions that check if `anti_shuffle` function is working as expected. Each test case checks if the output of the `anti_shuffle` function matches the expected output for the given input. When the code is executed, the test suite will catch and fail if the `anti_shuffle` function doesn't produce the expected output.
