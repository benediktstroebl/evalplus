The function processes the input string `s` and creates an ordered version of it, ensuring the order of words and blank spaces is preserved. It does this by splitting the string into words and then characters within those words. Characters are appended to a list if they are not space characters, and the list is sorted by ASCII value. The final ordered version of the string is created by joining the sorted character lists with the original word spacing.

The code includes tests that verify the function against various input scenarios, ensuring its correctness. You can use this code to safely solve the provided problem. Please note that this solution utilizes a char-wise approach, ensuring better accuracy and handling edge cases properly.
