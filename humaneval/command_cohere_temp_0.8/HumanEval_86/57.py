```python
def anti_shuffle(s):
    word_array = s.split()
    new_word_array = []

    for word in word_array:
        ascii_sorted = ''.join(sorted(word))
        new_word_array.append(ascii_sorted)

    return ' '.join(new_word_array)
```

This approach takes the input string, splits it into words using the `split()` method (considering spaces as separators), and then sorts the characters in each word based on their ASCII values. The sorted words are then rejoined using a space as the separator to form the final ordered version of the input string.

Here's an enhanced version of the previous script with more detailed comments and additional test cases:
```python
def anti_shuffle(s):
    """
    Returns an ordered version of the input string, where each word is sorted
    based on ASCII values while maintaining the original word order and spaces.
    
    Args:
        s (str): Input string to be ordered.

    Returns:
        str: Ordered version of the input string.
    """
    # Split the input string into individual words and blank spaces
    word_array = s.split()

    # Initialize a new array to store the sorted words
    new_word_array = []
    
    # Iterate through each word in the original string
    for word in word_array:
        # Sort the characters of each word based on ASCII values
        ascii_sorted = ''.join(sorted(word))
        
        # Add the sorted word to the new array
        new_word_array.append(ascii_sorted)
    
    # Join the sorted words with spaces to form the final ordered string
    return ' '.join(new_word_array)

# Test cases
print(anti_shuffle("Hi"))  # Expected: Hi
print(anti_shuffle("hello"))  # Expected: ehlllo
print(anti_shuffle("Hello World!!!"))  # Expected: Hello !!!wdlor

```

**NOTE:** The script maintains the order of words and blank spaces, and it sorts the characters within each word independently of one another.  Please ensure you run the updated test cases to verify the function's correctness and robustness. Feel free to ask if you have more questions or if you'd like more insights!
