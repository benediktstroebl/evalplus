```python
def anti_shuffle(s):
    word_array = s.split()
    new_word_array = []
    for word in word_array:
        ascii_ordered = ''.join(sorted(word))
        new_word_array.append(ascii_ordered)
    return ' '.join(new_word_array)
```

The function `anti_shuffle` takes a string as input and returns a sorted version of the string, where each word is sorted by its ASCII values while keeping the order of words and blank spaces. The above algorithm is implemented in Markdown.
