```python
def anti_shuffle(s):
    word_array = s.split()
    new_word_array = []
    for word in word_array:
        ascii_ordered = ''.join(sorted(word))
        new_word_array.append(ascii_ordered)
    return ' '.join(new_word_array)
```

This code defines a function `anti_shuffle` that takes a string as input and returns a sorted version of the words within the string, while maintaining the order of words and spaces.

The function first splits the input string into an array of words using the `split()` method. It then initializes an empty array `new_word_array` to store the sorted versions of each word.

Next, the function iterates through each word in the `word_array`, sorts the characters of each word in ascending order based on their ASCII values, and joins them back into a single string. This sorted string is then added to the `new_word_array`.

Finally, the function returns a space-separated string composed of the elements in `new_word_array`, representing the sorted version of the original input string.

This approach ensures that the order of words and spaces is preserved while rearranging the characters within each word based on ASCII values.
