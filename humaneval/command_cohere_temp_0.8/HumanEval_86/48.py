Here's a Python script that contains a function called anti_shuffle, defined to solve the problem as described:
```python
def anti_shuffle(s):
    # Split the string into individual words
    words = s.split()
    # Define a mapping dictionary to hold the sorted characters
    mapping = {}
    # Iterate through each word and create the mapping
    for word in words:
        sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))
        mapping[word] = sorted_word
    # Join the mapping back to a single string
    joined_mapping = ' '.join(mapping.values())
    # Return the ordered string
    return joined_mapping
```

This script defines the `anti_shuffle` function, which takes a string as input and returns a new string with the words sorted by their characters' ASCII values while maintaining the original word order and spaces.

The function first splits the input string into individual words using the `split()` method. It then initializes an empty dictionary called `mapping` to hold the sorted versions of each word. It iterates through each word in the list of split words, sorts the characters of each word in ascending order, and stores the result in the `mapping` dictionary. Finally, it retrieves the sorted words from the dictionary and joins them together with spaces to form the final ordered string and returns it. 

This solution is succinct and achieves the goal of the prompt. It also nicely demonstrates the use of dictionaries and sorting in Python. 

Here is an example of how you can use this function to perform the anti-shuffle operation and print the result:
```python 
print(anti_shuffle("Hello World!!!")) 
```

This will output:
```bash
Hello !!!Wdlor
``` 

Note that this function also preserves the spaces between words. 

This problem can also be solved using only Python's `sorted` function and a list comprehension, but the key objective here was to showcase the use of dictionaries in solving such problems.
