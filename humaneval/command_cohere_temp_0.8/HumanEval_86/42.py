```python
def anti_shuffle(s):
    word_array = s.split()
    new_word_array = []

    for word in word_array:
        ascii_sorted = ''.join(sorted(word))
        new_word_array.append(ascii_sorted)

    return ' '.join(new_word_array)
```

This approach first splits the string into words using the `split()` method. Then, we create a new list that contains each sorted word by taking the `ascii` values into consideration, using the `sorted()` function and joining them into a single string. The function returns the joined array of new words separated by spaces, maintaining the original word order and spaces.

The problem can be solved in a variety of ways, but this solution is concise, efficient, and easy to understand.  Python's built-in methods like `split()` and `sorted()` are carefully utilized to simplify the code and improve readability. The anti_shuffle function is now a useful tool for reordering strings based on different criteria and has a variety of applications in various domains, including data cleaning and string analysis.  It can be easily extended to handle a wide range of word rearrangement requirements.
