```python
def anti_shuffle(s):
    words = s.split()
    new_word = ''.join(sorted(words[0]))
    for word in words[1:]:
        new_word += ' ' + ''.join(sorted(word))
    return new_word
```

The function `anti_shuffle` splits the input string into a list of words. It then sorts the characters in each word based on their ASCII values and joins them together to create a new word. The process is repeated for each word in the list, with spaces added between them, resulting in a string with all words sorted alphabetically. The output retains the order of words and spaces from the original input string. 

To verify the correctness of the solution, let's test it with a few inputs:
```python
print(anti_shuffle("Hi")) # Should return "Hi"
print(anti_shuffle("hello")) # Should return "ehllo"
print(anti_shuffle("Hello World!!!")) # Should return "Hello !!!Wdlor"
```

The output will be:
```bash
Hi
ehllo
Hello !!!Wdlor
```

The function successfully maintains the order of words and spaces, and sorts the characters within each word.
