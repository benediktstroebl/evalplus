```python
def anti_shuffle(s):
    word_array = s.split()
    new_word_array = []
    for word in word_array:
        ascii_ordered = ''.join(sorted(word))
        new_word_array.append(ascii_ordered)
    return ' '.join(new_word_array)
```

This approach takes the input string, splits it into words using space as the delimiter, then iterates through each word. For each word, it sorts the characters alphabetically based on their ASCII values and joins them back together into a new word. These sorted words are then recombined with spaces using the `join` method and returned as the ordered version of the input string, retaining the original word placements and spaces. 

To verify the functionality of the code, let's test it with a few inputs:
```python
print(anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!')) # Should be: 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
print(anti_shuffle('hello')) # Should be: 'ehllo'
print(anti_shuffle('Hi')) # Should be: 'Hi'
```

The output will be:
```
Hello !!!Wdlor
ehllo
Hi
```

The function appropriately sorts the characters of each word based on ASCII values and maintains the structure of the original string.
