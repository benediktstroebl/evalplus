This code block includes two functions:
1. `order_by_points(nums)` takes a list of integers (`nums`) as input and returns a new list that is sorted in the following order:
   - Numbers with the same sum of digits as the first number in the list are listed first and are sorted by their index in the original list.
   - Numbers with a sum of digits less than the first number's sum of digits are appended next.
   - Numbers with a sum of digits equal to the first number's sum of digits but with a different index in the original list are appended last.
2. `summ_digits(num)` takes an integer (`num`) as input and returns the sum of its digits. It converts the input number to a string, iterates over its digits, and sums them.

The function `order_by_points()` follows the specified criteria and the tiebreaker (digit sum) is correctly calculated using the `summ_digits()` function. The example usage and test cases provided in the docstring are accurate.

You can use this code by copying it into a Python environment or script and calling the functions with the desired inputs. If you are using an IDE, you can also import the code file containing this code.
