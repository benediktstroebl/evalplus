This Python script defines a function `order_by_points()` that sorts a list of integers based on the sum of their digits, with indices as tiebreakers. It utilizes custom functions `sum_of_digits()` and `x_index()` to compute these values. The script includes test examples, ensuring the function behaves as expected. The output of the example usage is:
```
[-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]
[]
```
