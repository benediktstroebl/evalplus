This code includes three main functions:
1. `order_by_points(nums)`: This function sorts the input list `nums` based on the sum of their digits in ascending order. If there's a tie, the tiebreaker is the index of the number in the original list. The function returns the sorted list.
2. `sum_of_digits(num)`: This function calculates the sum of the digits of the given number `num`. It uses a generator expression to sum the digits in the string representation of the absolute value of `num`.
3. `x_index(num)`: This function determines the index of the given number `num` within the original list `nums`. It uses the `index` method to find the index if `nums` is not empty. If `nums` is empty, it returns 0 as a default index.

The code also includes test cases to validate the functionality of the `order_by_points` function. You can uncomment the test cases and run them to see the expected output.
