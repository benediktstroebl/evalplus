This code provides the functions to sort the list of integers according to the sum of their digits. The `order_by_points` function sorts the list and returns it as the final solution. The `sum_of_digits` function is used within the `order_by_points` function to calculate the sum of digits for each integer and sort them accordingly. 

The execution order is as follows:
1. The list of integers is sorted by the sum of the digits of each integer using the `sum_of_digits` function as the sorting key. 
2. If there is a tie, the original list index is used as a tie-breaker to ensure the sorting is correct. 

The code is encapsulated and self-contained, providing an optimized and efficient solution to the problem statement. It also includes a basic example and test cases to verify the functionality of the code. 

This script adheres to the problem statement by sorting the list as described, and therefore will return the expected result when applied to the example list provided in the problem statement.

Note: The code includes additional test cases to ensure the robustness and functionality of the program, which may be useful for practical applications but are not explicitly asked for in the problem statement. In this case, you may omit these additional tests for brevity, as the code already works as expected. Feel free to include them for completeness if desired.
