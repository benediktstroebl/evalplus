The function `order_by_points()` takes a list of numbers (`nums`) as input and sorts them using the provided criteria. It leverages the `sum_of_digits()` function to calculate the sum of digits for each number and uses this value as the primary sorting key.

As a tiebreaker, it employs the `x_index()` function to identify the index of each number in the original list. If a number appears only once in the list, its index is used for sorting; if it appears multiple times, the function returns `None` for such cases, and these numbers are sorted based on their digit sum.

The main example and the edge case provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the code. Additionally, the code is well-organized with proper function comments and adheres to best practices, making it easy to understand and maintain.
