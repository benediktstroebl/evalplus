This code includes three distinct functions: 

1. `order_by_points(nums)` serves as the main function, sorting the provided list of integers according to the criteria mentioned in the problem statement. It uses `sum_of_digits(num)` to calculate the sum of digits for each number and `x_index(num)` to establish the index of each integer within the original list. The results are sorted according to this key.
2. `sum_of_digits(num)` converts a given number to a string, iterates through its digits, and returns the sum of these digits.
3. `x_index(num)` identifies the index of a given number within the original list, guaranteeing correct tiebreakers in the event of equal digit sums. 

This code efficiently solves the problem and provides an example test case to validate its correctness. You can use this code as a self-contained Python script to solve the specified problem.
