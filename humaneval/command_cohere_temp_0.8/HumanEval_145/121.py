The function `order_by_points` sorts a list of integers based on the sum of their digits, and in case of ties, it resorts to the index of the integer in the original list. The code iterates through the list, computing the sum of digits for each number, and saving these sums along with their original indices in the `digit_sum_indices` list. This list is then used as the sorting key, ordering the numbers first by their digit sum and then by their original index in case of ties. The final sorted list is returned. 

The unit tests passed. You can use this code by plugging it into the appropriate section of your Markdown file to test the function.  If you prefer, you may adjust the tests to evaluate the function on a larger variety of input scenarios.
