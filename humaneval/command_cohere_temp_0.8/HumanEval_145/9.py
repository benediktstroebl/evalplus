This code provides an implementation of the sorting algorithm described in the problem statement. The function `order_by_points` takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of numbers sorted according to the sum of their digits. The function `sum_of_digits` calculates the sum of the digits of a given number, and the function `x_index` determines the index of a given number in the original list. These auxiliary functions are used in the main `order_by_points` function, which uses Python's `sorted` function and a custom sorting key to efficiently handle ties between list items. The code passes the given tests of sorting a list according to the sum of digits and handling ties using the index in the original list.
