This code provides an accurate response to the problem statement by employing three functions: `order_by_points`, which sorts the list based on digit sums and original indices; `sum_of_digits`, which calculates the sum of digits of a given number; and `x_index`, which determines the index of a specific number within the original list. These functions collaborate to produce the desired sorted list as the output, satisfying the criteria set forth in the issue. Additionally, the code includes docstrings and variable names that are concise and descriptive, enhancing the readability and comprehension of the solution. 
Overall, it is a well-organized and efficient approach to the problem. GPT-4.
