```

This code provides an accurate solution to the problem statement and aligns with the expected behavior,
as outlined in the problem statement and reflected in the sample tests. I've included the `x_index`
function to determine the index of a number in the original list, which is used as a tiebreaker.

Feel free to adapt this code to your needs. Let me know if you would like to proceed with additional
exploration or if you have any further questions!
