This Python script solves the problem statement by using the `sum_of_digits` function to calculate the sum of digits for each number, and using that as the primary sorting key. In cases where numbers have the same sum of digits, the `x_index` function is used to sort them based on their index in the original list, and items appearing more than once in the list are prioritized using the `index` function. The function has been tested with various inputs, and the output matches the expected order.
