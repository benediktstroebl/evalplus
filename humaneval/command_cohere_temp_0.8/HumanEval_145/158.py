The function order_by_points takes a list of integers nums as input and sorts them according to the sum of their digits. If there is a tie, the tiebreaker is the index of the number in the original list. The functions sum_of_digits and x_index are used to calculate these key values for sorting. This code should work correctly for various inputs and scenarios like empty lists or lists with negative numbers.  It passes the given tests as the output will be:
```python
[-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]
```
