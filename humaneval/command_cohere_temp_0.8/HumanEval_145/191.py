This Python script solves the problem by using a custom key for the `sorted` function. It implements two keys: 

1. `sum_of_digits(lambda x: sum_of_digits(x))`: This key extracts the sum of digits from a number. It's a separate function to ensure compatibility with Python 3, which requires `str` values to be converted to `int` for `sum` to work with tuples.
2. `x_index(lambda x: x_index(x)`: This key finds the index of the number in the original list. It's also in a separate function to avoid issues with using `index` on a mutable object (`list`).

These keys are used in conjunction to sort the list. In case of a tie in the sum of digits, the index will serve as the tiebreaker. The script includes tests to validate its behavior against the given examples in the problem statement.
