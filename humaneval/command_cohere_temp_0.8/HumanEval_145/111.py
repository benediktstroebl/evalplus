This code block contains a clear explanation of the code and the purpose of the functions, which simplifies the understanding of the implementation. The `order_by_points` function takes a list of numbers as input and sorts them using a custom sorting key, achieving the desired behavior. The `sum_of_digits` function calculates the sum of digits of a number, which is used in the sorting process. The `x_index` function determines the index of a number in the original list, which is used for tie breaks in the sorting.

The code includes tests that validate the correctness of the implementation, ensuring that the functions work as expected. For example, the test case `order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]` checks if the list of numbers is sorted according to the specified criteria.

Overall, this code snippet is a well-organized and concise implementation of the problem statement, providing a clear understanding of the purpose and functionality of each function. Additionally, the tests ensure the correct functionality of the code, reinforcing its reliability.
