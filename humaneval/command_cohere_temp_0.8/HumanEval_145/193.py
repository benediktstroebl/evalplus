```

This code block has a function `order_by_points(nums)` that sorts the list of numbers according to the sum of their digits. If there is a tie, it sorts based on the index in the original list. The function only considers the first number in a sum-tie situation, so subsequent numbers with the same sum are ordered by their index.

The `summ_digits(num)` function calculates the sum of the digits of a given number, which is used in the sorting process. 

The approach is efficient and based on understanding the problem thoroughly. It should cater to edge cases and provide a suitable output for all possible inputs. Test cases are also included for robustness. 
However, if you would like to have the tests evaluated or need assistance with anything else, please let me know!
