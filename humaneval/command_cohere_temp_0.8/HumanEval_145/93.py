The function `order_by_points` sorts a list of integers based on the sum of their digits. If multiple numbers have the same digit sum, the tie is broken by using the index of the original list. The function returns the sorted list. It handles an empty list gracefully and uses efficient algorithms and data structures for the task. 

This approach ensures that the sorting is consistent with the problem requirements, as it combines the sum of digits and the original index as tiebreakers. 

The unit tests would look like: 
```python
# Test the function with a sample input
assert order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]

# Test with an empty list
assert order_by_points([]) == []

# Test with only positive integers
assert order_by_points([2, 22, 202, 12, 123]) == [2, 12, 22, 123, 202]

# Test with only negative integers
assert order_by_points([-3, -13, -33, -103, -312]) == [-312, -103, -33, -13, -3]

# Test with a mix of positive and negative integers
assert order_by_points([3, 33, -3, -33, -103, 103]) == [−103, −33, −3, 3, 33, 103]
