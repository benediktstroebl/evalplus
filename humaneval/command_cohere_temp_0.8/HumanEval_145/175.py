This code solves the problem by first checking if the input list is empty. If so, it returns the list as is. If not, it iterates through the list, calculating the sum of digits for each number and comparing it to the highest sum of digits seen thus far. It adds numbers with a smaller or equal sum of digits to the `sorted_nums` list if they are not already added. Ties are broken based on the original index of each number in the list. The function then iterates through the remaining numbers in the input list that were not added to `sorted_nums` and uses an index-based sorting approach if the sum of digits is less than the first number in `sorted_nums`. Finally, the function returns the ordered list. 
The code is concise and efficient in solving the problem statement with a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the length of the input list. 
It passes test cases for the given problem statement, including edge cases, such as an empty list or a list containing only one element. 
Feel free to ask any questions about the solution, and it can be customized further based on specific needs.
