    >>> order_by_points([]) == []

    # Reverse the sorting order of the sum of the digits.
    # This is done by summing the index of the digit instead of the digit itself.
    # E.g. '2' -> 0, '12' -> 1, '123' -> 2, ...

This code block defines the `order_by_points` function, which takes a list of integers as input and sorts them according to the sum of their digits in ascending order. If there are multiple numbers with the same digit sum, the tie is broken by using the index of the number in the original list. The function then returns the sorted list. It also includes a test suite to verify the function against several test cases. You can use this code block to quickly solve this particular problem in a self-contained manner.
