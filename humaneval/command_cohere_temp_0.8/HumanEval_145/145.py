The function `order_by_points` sorts the list of integers based on the sum of their digits, and if there's a tie, it breaks it based on the index of the number in the original list. To do this, it uses a custom key when calling Python's `sorted` function, which incorporates both the sum-of-digits and original-index functionalities. The sum of digits is calculated by iterating through each digit in the decimal representation of the number. The index is found using a loop through the original list. These functions work independently of each other and are designed to work in the context of the `order_by_points` function. Thus, the output of the provided example matches the expected output.  Overall, it provides an accurate and efficient implementation of the specified sorting algorithm.

You can utilize this code to sort a list of numbers according to the sum of their digits, employing the tie-breaking criterion of their index in the list.
