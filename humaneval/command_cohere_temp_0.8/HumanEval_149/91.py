```python
def sorted_list_sum(lst):
    lst_new = []
    for el in lst:
        if len(el) % 2 == 0:
            lst_new.append(el)
    lst_new.sort()
    for el in lst_new:
        if el != lst_new[0]:
            break
    return lst_new[:len(lst_new) - 1]
```
This function accepts a list of strings, deletes the strings with odd lengths, and returns the resulted list in sorted order. The list is always a list of strings and never an array of numbers. It may contain duplicates. The order of the list should be ascending by the length of each word. For elements with the same length, sort the list alphabetically. The function should return a list of strings in sorted order.

You can test this function using the following input/output examples, which are designed to ensure that the function performs as expected and aligns with the problem statement:
```python
def test_sorted_list_sum():
    assert sorted_list_sum(["aa", "a", "aaa"]) == ["aa"]
    assert sorted_list_sum(["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"]) == ["ab", "cd"]
    assert sorted_list_sum(["ab", "cd", "abcd", "cdcd", "efg", "abc", "cdef"]) == ["ab", "abcd", "abc", "cdef", "cd", "cdcd", "efg"]
    assert sorted_list_sum([("aa", 1), ("a", 1), ("aaa", 1), ("bb", 2), ("b", 2), ("bbb", 2), ("cc", 3), ("c", 3), ("ccc", 3), ("dd", 4), ("d", 4), ("ddd", 4), ("ee", 5), ("e", 5), ("eee", 5)]) == [("aa", 1), ("a", 1), ("aaa", 1), ("b", 2), ("bb", 2), ("bbb", 2), ("c", 3), ("cc", 3), ("ccc", 3), ("d", 4), ("dd", 4), ("ddd", 4), ("e", 5), ("ee", 5), ("eee", 5)]
```

This is a comprehensive list of tests designed to validate the correctness of the `sorted_list_sum` function. Each test case provides a list of input values and verifies the output against the expected result. These tests cover various scenarios, including lists with different types of elements and duplicates.
