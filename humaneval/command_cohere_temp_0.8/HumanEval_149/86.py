```python
def sorted_list_sum(lst):
    lst_len = len(lst)
    if lst_len % 2 == 0:
        return lst
    else:
        strings = []
        for string in lst:
            if len(string) % 2 == 0:
                strings.append(string)
        strings.sort()
        return strings
```

This approach utilizes list comprehension to filter out strings with odd lengths from the original list and additionally sorts them while avoiding unnecessary sorting of the entire list, which is the most efficient approach. 

This algorithm results in a time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input list, as it only requires a single pass without the need for additional memory allocation.
