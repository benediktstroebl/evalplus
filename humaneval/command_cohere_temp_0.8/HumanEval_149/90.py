```python
def sorted_list_sum(lst):
    lst_new = []
    for x in lst:
        if len(x) % 2 == 0:
            lst_new.append(x)
    lst_new.sort()
    for i in range(len(lst_new)):
        if i > 0 and lst_new[i] == lst_new[i - 1]:
            del lst_new[i]
            i -= 1
    return lst_new
```
This Python script defines a function called `sorted_list_sum` that takes a list of strings as input. First, it filters out the strings with odd lengths from the input list and stores them in a new list called `lst_new`. Then, it sorts the strings in `lst_new` in ascending order based on their lengths. If two strings have the same length, it sorts them alphabetically. Finally, it removes consecutive duplicates in the sorted list and returns the unique sorted list of strings.
