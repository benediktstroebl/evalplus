```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(el for el in lst if el % 2 == 1 and (len(lst) - el + 1) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function named solution which takes a list of integers as input. It aims to calculate the sum of odd numbers within even positions in the list. To accomplish this, it employs a list comprehension, iterating through each element in the input list. For each element, it checks two conditions: first, whether the element is odd (i.e., its remainder when divided by 2 is equal to 1), and second, whether its position (calculated as `len(lst) - el + 1`) is even. If both conditions are met, the element is included in the sum, and the result is returned. The function's output is the sum of odd numbers in even positions within the provided list.
