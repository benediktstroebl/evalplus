```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(el for el in lst if el % 2 == 1 and lst.index(el) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list lst as input. It aims to calculate the sum of odd numbers present in even positions within the list. To accomplish this, it employs a list comprehension, iterating through each element el in lst. Within the list comprehension, two conditions are checked: el % 2 == 1 to ensure it represents an odd number, and lst.index(el) % 2 == 0 to verify if the element is in an even position within the list. The sum function then calculates the total of the elements that satisfy both conditions. The function returns the resulting sum. 

Overall, this solution efficiently computes the required sum, providing the sum of odd numbers present in even positions within the given list. 
```
This problem can be solved in a variety of ways. Let's break down the thought process:
1. Identify odd elements: We need to identify the odd elements in the list. We can do this using the modulo operator % by checking if the remainder of the element divided by 2 is 1.
2. Identify even positions: We need to determine if the element is in an even position in the list, which we can determine by modulo-ing the index of the element in the list by 2.
3. Sum the eligible elements: We sum all elements that satisfy both conditions.

This solution follows a Pythonic approach and efficiently solves the problem with a clear and concise codebase, making it easier to understand and maintain. Gesundheit!
