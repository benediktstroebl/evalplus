```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(x for x in lst if x % 2 == 1 and (len(lst) - lst.index(x)) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of numbers as input. It is designed to calculate the sum of all odd numbers within the list that appear in even positions. To achieve this, it employs a conditional check, examining whether each number is odd (x % 2 == 1) and whether its position is even (len(lst) - lst.index(x)) % 2 == 0). The sum function is then used to aggregate the values that satisfy this condition. The result is the sum of odd numbers in even positions among the list of integers provided.
