```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(x for x in lst if x % 2 and lst.index(x) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of integers as input. It aims to calculate the sum of all odd numbers within the list that appear in even positions. To achieve this, it employs a list comprehension, iterating through each element x in the input list lst. The comprehension checks if x is odd (via the condition x % 2) and if it appears in an even position within the list (determined by lst.index(x) % 2 == 0). When both conditions are met, the value of x is added to the running sum. The function then returns the calculated sum of odd numbers in even positions. Notably, the solution handles cases where there are no odd elements in even positions, returning 0 in such scenarios. Overall, the function is designed to solve the specified problem in an efficient and concise manner.
