```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(el for el in lst if el % 2 == 1 and lst.index(el) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of integers as input. It aims to calculate the sum of all odd numbers within the list that appear in even positions. To accomplish this, it employs a list comprehension, iterating through each element in the input list. For each element, it checks if the element is odd (using the condition `el % 2 == 1`) and whether its index is even (using the modulo operator `lst.index(el) % 2 == 0`). If both conditions are met, the element is included in the sum, and the result is returned. The function's output is the sum of odd numbers in even positions within the provided list.
