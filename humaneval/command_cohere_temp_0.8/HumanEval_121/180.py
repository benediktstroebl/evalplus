```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(el for el in lst if el % 2 == 1 and (len(lst) - el + 1) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of numbers as input. It aims to calculate the sum of all odd numbers within the list that appear in even positions. The function achieves this by employing a generator expression within the sum function, filtering elements that meet the condition of being odd and appearing in even positions. The result is the sum of these filtered numbers. The function solves the challenge as described in the prompt and should produce the expected output for the given test cases.
