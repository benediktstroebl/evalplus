```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(el for el in lst if el % 2 == 1 and (len(lst) - el + 1) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of numbers as input. This function calculates the sum of all odd numbers within the even positions of the list. To achieve this, it employs a list comprehension, iterating through each element (el) in the input list (lst). It checks if the current element is odd (el % 2 == 1) and whether its position (determined by (len(lst) - el + 1) % 2) is even. If both conditions are met, the element is included in the sum, and the total is returned. The function's output is the sum of odd numbers in even positions, as described in the problem statement.
