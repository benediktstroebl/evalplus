```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(x for x in lst if x % 2 == 1 and (len(lst) - x + 1) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of integers as input. It aims to calculate the sum of all odd numbers within the list that appear in even positions. The formula employs a generator expression and a sum function to extract and add up the relevant odd numbers. The overall time complexity is O(n), where n represents the size of the input list.
