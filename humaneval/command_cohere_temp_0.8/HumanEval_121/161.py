```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(el for el in lst if el % 2 == 1 and lst.index(el) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list lst as input. It aims to calculate the sum of odd numbers present in even positions within the list. To do this, it employs a list comprehension, iterating through each element el in the input list. It checks two conditions for each element: first, whether the element is odd (el % 2 == 1), and second, whether its index within the list is even (lst.index(el) % 2 == 0). If both conditions are true, the element is included in the sum calculated by the comprehension, and the result is returned as the output. The function's overall behavior is to identify and sum odd numbers located in even positions within the provided list.
