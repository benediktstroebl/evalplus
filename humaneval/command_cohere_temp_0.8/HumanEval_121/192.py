```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(num for num in lst if num % 2 == 1 and (len(lst) - num) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of integers as input. It calculates the sum of odd numbers within the even positions of the list. To accomplish this, it employs a list comprehension, iterating through each element in the input list. For each number, it checks if the number is odd and whether its position (determined by `(len(lst) - num) % 2`) is even. If both conditions are met, the number is included in the sum, and the total is returned as the function's result. The function's output is determined entirely by the provided code and does not rely on any external variables or assumptions. Thus, it constitutes a self-contained solution to the problem as mentioned in the markdown code block. 
This approach provides a clear and concise solution to the specified problem while adhering to Python's coding best practices. Glossary:
- list comprehension: A concise way of creating a new list by applying an operation or transformation to each item in the existing list.
- sum: A built-in Python function that calculates the sum of all elements in a collection, such as a list.
- odd numbers: Numbers that cannot be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder.
- even numbers: Numbers that can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder.
- len(): A built-in Python function that returns the number of items in a container, such as a list or a string.
- list: A data structure that contains an ordered collection of elements, where each element has a specific index identifying its position.
