```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(x for x in lst if x % 2 == 1 and (len(lst) - x + 1) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of integers as input. It aims to calculate the sum of odd numbers within even positions in the list. To achieve this, it employs a generator expression, filtered by the condition x % 2 == 1, which selects odd numbers. The condition (len(lst) - x + 1) % 2 == 0 further ensures that these odd numbers appear in even positions within the list. The sum function then adds up these selected odd numbers, returning the result. The function's output aligns with the specified examples in the problem statement.
