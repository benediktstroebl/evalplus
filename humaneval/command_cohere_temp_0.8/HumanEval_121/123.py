```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(el for el in lst if el % 2 == 1 and lst.index(el) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of numbers as input. This function calculates the sum of all odd numbers present in even positions within the list. To accomplish this, it employs a list comprehension, iterating through each element in the input list. For each number, it checks if the number is odd and whether its position in the list is even (indicated by the index % 2 == 0), adding the number to the running total if both conditions are met. The function then returns the total of all odd numbers in even positions. This solution is appropriately encapsulated within a single function, making it readily reusable and executable in isolation.
