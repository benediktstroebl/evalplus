```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(el for el in lst if el % 2 == 1 and (len(lst) - el + 1) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function named solution which takes a list of integers as input. It aims to calculate the sum of odd numbers within even positions in the list. To accomplish this, it employs a list comprehension, iterating through each element (el) in the input list (lst). For each element, it checks two conditions:
1. Whether the element is odd (el % 2 == 1), and,
2. Whether its position is even (len(lst) - el + 1) % 2 == 0).

The formula (len(lst) - el + 1) is used to determine the position of the element in the list, accounting for the 0-based index interpretation in Python.

If both conditions are met, the element is included in the sum calculation, and the result is returned.

The function operates without any reliance on external variables or context, making it self-contained. It can be invoked with a list as an argument to calculate the desired sum.
