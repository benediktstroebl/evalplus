```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(x for x in lst if x % 2 == 1 and (len(lst) - lst.index(x) - 1) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of numbers as input. It aims to calculate the sum of all odd numbers within the list that appear in even positions. The function achieves this by employing a generator expression within the sum function, filtering out elements that meet the specified conditions. The conditions are that the element is odd (`x % 2 == 1`) and its index mod 2 results in 0 (`(len(lst) - lst.index(x) - 1) % 2 == 0`), indicating it appears in an even position. The resulting filtered sum is then returned as the output of the function.
