```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(el for el in lst if el % 2 == 1 and (len(lst) - el + 1) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of integers as input. It aims to calculate the sum of odd numbers within even positions in the list. To accomplish this, it employs a list comprehension, iterating through each element in the input list. For each element, it checks two conditions: first, whether the element is odd (i.e., its remainder when divided by 2 is equal to 1); and second, whether its position (calculated as length of the list - current element + 1) is even. If both conditions are met, the element is included in the sum, resulting in the return of the total odd value in even positions.
