```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(el for el in lst if el % 2 == 1 and lst.index(el) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of numbers as input. This function calculates the sum of all odd numbers present in even positions within the list. To achieve this, it employs a list comprehension with a generator expression, checking for elements that meet the condition of being odd and placed in even positions. The sum of such elements is then returned. The function's behavior is further demonstrated through examples, illustrating its applicability and correctness for the given problem.
