```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(el for el in lst if el % 2 == 1 and (len(lst) - el + 1) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of integers as input. It aims to calculate the sum of odd numbers within even positions in the list. To achieve this, it employs a list comprehension, iterating through each element (el) in the input list (lst). For each element, it checks two conditions: first, whether the element is odd (el % 2 == 1), and second, whether its position (determined by (len(lst) - el + 1) % 2) is even. If both conditions are met, the element is included in the sum, and the result is returned. The function works correctly without any issues.
