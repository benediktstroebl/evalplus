```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(x for x in lst if x % 2 == 1 and lst.index(x) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of integers as input. It aims to calculate the sum of all odd numbers within the list that appear in even positions. To achieve this, it employs a conditional expression leveraging the modulo operator (%) to determine if a number is odd or even. The index() method retrieves the position of each number in the list. Subsequently, the sum() function is used to calculate the total of numbers that satisfy the condition. This function effectively computes the desired sum and returns the result.
