```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(x for x in lst if x % 2 == 1 and (len(lst) - x + 1) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of integers as input. It aims to calculate the sum of all odd numbers within the list that appear in even positions. To accomplish this, it employs a generator expression, filtering elements (x) from the list using the condition that they are odd (x % 2 == 1) and appear in even positions (lengths - x + 1) % 2 == 0). The sum function then adds up these selected odd numbers. This way, the function solves the challenge of finding the sum of odd elements in even positions effectively.
