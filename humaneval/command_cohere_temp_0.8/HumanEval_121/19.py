```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(x for x in lst if x % 2 == 1 and (len(lst) - x + 1) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of integers as input. It aims to calculate the sum of odd numbers within even positions in the list.

The function uses a generator expression alongside the sum function to iterate through the list and add up the values that meet the specified conditions. The conditions are checked with two modulo operations: x % 2 == 1 checks if the number is odd, and (len(lst) - x + 1) % 2 == 0 verifies if the number is in an even position within the list.
