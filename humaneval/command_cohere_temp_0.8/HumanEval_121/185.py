```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(el for el in lst if el % 2 == 1 and (len(lst) - el + 1) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of integers as input. It aims to calculate the sum of odd numbers within even positions in the list.

To accomplish this, the function employs a generator expression alongside the sum function. The generator expression iterates through each element in the input list using el for el in lst. It then checks if the element is odd (el % 2 == 1) and whether its position is even (len(lst) - el + 1) % 2 == 0). If both conditions are met, the element is included in the sum.

The function's output is the total of all odd numbers in even positions within the list. This approach ensures efficiency and readability while solving the problem.
