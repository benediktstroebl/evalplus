```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(x for x in lst if x % 2 == 1 and (len(lst) - lst.index(x)) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of numbers as input. It is designed to calculate the sum of all odd numbers within the list that appear in even positions. To achieve this, it employs a conditional loop that iterates through the list, checking if each element is odd and if its position is even, defined by the formula (len(lst) - lst.index(x)) % 2 == 0. The sum function is then used to aggregate these odd numbers in even positions, and the result is returned as the output of the function. The function's outcome is dependent on the list provided, and it returns the requested sum according to the specifications outlined in the function docstring.
