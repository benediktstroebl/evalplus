```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(el for el in lst if el % 2 == 1 and (len(lst) - el + 1) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of integers as input. It aims to calculate the sum of odd numbers within even positions in the list. To accomplish this, it employs a list comprehension, iterating through each element (el) in the input list (lst). For each element, it checks two conditions:
1. Whether the element is odd (el % 2 == 1), and,
2. Whether its position is even (len(lst) - el + 1) % 2 == 0).

The formula (len(lst) - el + 1) determines the position of an element in the list, considering indexing starting from 0. If both conditions are met, the element is included in the sum. The result is the total of odd elements in even positions in the list. The function is designed to be self-contained with no external dependencies, making it portable and easily understandable.
