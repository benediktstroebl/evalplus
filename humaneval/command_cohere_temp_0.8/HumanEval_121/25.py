```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(x for x in lst if x % 2 == 1 and lst.index(x) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of integers as input. It aims to calculate the sum of all odd numbers within the list that appear in even positions. To achieve this, it employs a generator expression, filtered by the condition x % 2 == 1 and lst.index(x) % 2 == 0. The lst.index(x) checks for the position of each number in the list, ensuring that we only consider odd numbers in even positions. Finally, the sum function aggregates the values returned by the generator expression, giving the total of odd elements in even positions in the list.
