```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(el for el in lst if el % 2 == 1 and (len(lst) - lst.index(el) - 1) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of integers as input. It aims to calculate the sum of odd numbers within even positions in the list. To achieve this, it employs a list comprehension, iterating through each element in the input list. For each element, it checks two conditions: first, whether the element is odd (i.e., its remainder when divided by 2 is equal to 1); and second, whether its position in the list is even (which is determined by checking whether the length of the list minus its index is odd or even). If both conditions are met, the element is included in the sum, and the result is returned. The function efficiently solves the problem as described in the prompt.
