```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(el for el in lst if el % 2 == 1 and lst.index(el) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of numbers as input. This function calculates the sum of all odd numbers present in even positions within the list. To achieve this, it employs a list comprehension, iterating through each element in the input list. For each number, it checks if the number is odd and whether its position in the list is even (determined by the modulo operation with 2). If both conditions are met, the number is added to the running sum, returned upon completion. The function's effectiveness lies in its ability to directly target and sum the odd numbers in even positions, leading to a concise and optimized solution.
