```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(el for el in lst if el % 2 == 1 and (len(lst) - el + 1) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of integers as input. It aims to calculate the sum of all odd numbers within the list that appear in even positions. The function achieves this by employing a list comprehension, iterating through each element in the input list. For each element, it checks whether the element is odd and whether its position (determined by `len(lst) - el + 1`) is even. If both conditions are met, the element is included in the sum, and the total is returned as the function's result. The behavior is illustrated through examples in the code block.
