```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(x for x in lst if x % 2 == 1 and (len(lst) - x + 1) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of numbers as input. This function calculates the sum of all odd numbers present in the even positions of the list and returns the result. To achieve this, it employs a generator expression, filtered by the condition x % 2 == 1, which selects odd numbers in the list. The condition (len(lst) - x + 1) % 2 == 0 further ensures that these odd numbers appear in even positions, and the sum function computes their aggregate. Notably, the latter condition hinges on the parity of the position index (len(lst) - x + 1), rather than the element's index x itself. Thus, the function effectively solves the problem as described in the markdown code block provided.
