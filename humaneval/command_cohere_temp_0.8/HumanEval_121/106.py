```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(x for x in lst if x % 2 and lst.index(x) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of integers as input. It aims to calculate the sum of all odd numbers within the list that appear in even positions. To accomplish this, it utilizes a generator expression, filtered by the condition x % 2 != 0 and the index odd_pos % 2 == 0, to iterate through the list and sum the odd numbers in even positions, returning the result. The function is designed to solve the provided problem statement and emulate the behavior outlined in the examples.
