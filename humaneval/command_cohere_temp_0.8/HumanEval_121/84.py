```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(el for el in lst if el % 2 == 1 and (len(lst) - el + 1) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of numbers as input. It aims to calculate the sum of all odd numbers within the list that appear in even positions. The function achieves this by employing a list comprehension, iterating through each number in the input list. For each element, it checks whether the element is odd and whether its position within the list is even (determined by the formula `len(lst) - el + 1`). If both conditions are met, the element is included in the sum, and the total is returned as the function's output. The given examples in the code block provide insight into its behavior for different input lists.
