```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(num for num in lst if num % 2 == 1 and lst.index(num) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of integers as input. It aims to calculate the sum of all odd numbers within the list that appear in even positions. To achieve this, it employs a list comprehension, iterating through each element in the input list `lst`. For each number, it checks two conditions: first, whether the number is odd (`num % 2 == 1`), and second, whether its index within the list is even (`lst.index(num) % 2 == 0`). If both conditions are met, the number is included in the sum calculated by the `sum()` function. The resulting sum is returned as the output of the function. 

This solution directly targets the specified conditions in the problem statement and employs a clear logic of filtering and summing the relevant numbers. It's a concise and efficient way to solve the problem.
