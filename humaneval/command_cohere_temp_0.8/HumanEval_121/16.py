```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(el for el in lst if el % 2 == 1 and (len(lst) - el + 1) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function named 'solution' which takes a list of integers as an input. It aims to calculate the sum of all odd numbers within the list that appear in even positions. To achieve this, it employs a list comprehension, iterating through each element in the input list. For each element, it checks two conditions: first, whether the element is odd (i.e., its remainder when divided by 2 is equal to 1); and second, whether its position within the list is even (i.e., its index is divisible by 2). If both conditions are met, the element is included in the sum, and the total is returned as the function's output. The script's purpose is to provide a self-contained implementation to solve the specified problem, as given in the markdown code block.
