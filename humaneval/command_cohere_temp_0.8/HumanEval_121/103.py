```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(num for num in lst if num % 2 == 1 and lst.index(num) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of integers as input. It aims to calculate the sum of odd numbers present in even positions within the list. To accomplish this, it employs a list comprehension, iterating through each element in the input list `lst`. For each number, it checks two conditions: first, whether the number is odd (`num % 2 == 1`), and second, whether its index within the list is even (`lst.index(num) % 2 == 0`). If both conditions are met, the number is included in the sum calculated by the `sum()` function. The resulting sum of odd numbers in even positions is then returned as the output of the function. 

This solution directly targets the given problem statement, efficiently evaluating the required sum without introducing any extraneous complexity. It provides a clear and concise implementation, fulfilling the task outlined in the prompt.
