```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(num for num in lst if num % 2 == 1 and lst.index(num) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of integers as input. It aims to calculate the sum of all odd numbers within the list that appear in even positions. To achieve this, it employs a list comprehension, iterating through each element in the input list `lst`. For each number, it checks two conditions: first, whether the number is odd (`num % 2 == 1`), and second, whether its index within the list is even (`lst.index(num) % 2 == 0`). If both conditions are met, the number is included in the sum calculated by the `sum()` function. This concise script successfully solves the problem posed in the markdown code block. The provided examples in the docstring are accurate, and the function returns the expected results for the given input lists.
