```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(x for x in lst if x % 2 == 1 and (len(lst) - lst.index(x) - 1) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of numbers as input. It is designed to calculate the sum of all odd numbers within the list that appear in even positions. To do this, it uses a generator expression, aided by the len() function to determine the position of each number within the list, filtering out numbers that don't meet the criteria. The function then sums these filtered numbers and returns the result.

Given the example inputs provided in the docstring, the solution function would respectively return:
- 12 (for [5, 8, 7, 1])
- 9 (for [3, 3, 3, 3, 3])
- 0 (for [30, 13, 24, 321])

The function's purpose is to identify and sum odd numbers within even positions within a list, and the provided examples demonstrate its correct functionality.
