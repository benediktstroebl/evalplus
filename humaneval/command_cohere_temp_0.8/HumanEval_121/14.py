```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(el for el in lst if el % 2 == 1 and lst.index(el) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of integers as input. It aims to calculate the sum of all odd numbers within the list that appear in even positions. To accomplish this, it employs a list comprehension, iterating through each element in the input list. For each element, it checks if the element is odd and if its position in the list is even (using the modulo operator). If both conditions are met, the element is included in the sum, and the result is returned. The function's output is determined entirely by the provided list of integers, making it dependent on the input list's odd elements in even positions.
