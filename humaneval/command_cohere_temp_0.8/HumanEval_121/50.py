```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(el for el in lst if el % 2 == 1 and (len(lst) - el + 1) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function named solution which takes a list of numbers as an input. This function calculates the sum of all odd numbers present at even positions within the list. To achieve this, it employs a list comprehension, iterating through each element in the input list. For each element, it checks two conditions: first, whether the element is odd (i.e., its remainder when divided by 2 is 1), and second, whether its position in the list is even (i.e., its index is divisible by 2). If both conditions are met, the element is included in the sum, resulting in the return of the total value. 

For example, when called with the list [5, 8, 7, 1], it will return 12, as the odd elements in even positions are 5 and 1, summing to 12. When called with [3, 3, 3, 3, 3], it will return 9, as all elements are odd and positioned at even indexes. And lastly, for the list [30, 13, 24, 321], it will return 0, as there are no odd elements in even positions in this list. This clarification underscores the precise nature of the problem's requirement, which is accurately computed by the provided Python script.
