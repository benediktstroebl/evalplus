```python
def solution(lst):
    return sum(x for x in lst if x % 2 == 1 and lst.index(x) % 2 == 0)
```
This Python script defines a function called solution, which takes a list of integers as input. It aims to calculate the sum of all odd numbers within the list that appear in even positions. To accomplish this, it utilizes a generator expression, aided by the index technique, to identify and sum the relevant numbers. The function returns the calculated sum. Notably, the indexation technique ensures accuracy, pinpointing even positions within the list.

This solution follows a concise and efficient approach, employing a generator expression to iterate through elements and evaluate conditions, thus demonstrating a balanced blend of simplicity and effectiveness.

This problem can also be solved using two pointers in a list:
1. Initialize two pointers, even and odd, both pointing to the first element of the list.
2. Move the even pointer ahead by 2, as one wants odd numbers in even positions and skip the first two positions.
3. Return the sum of elements pointed to by the odd pointer, as those are the odd numbers in even positions.
4. In the following iteration, move both pointers ahead by 2, as again one skips the even position.
5. Repeat step 4 until the odd pointer reaches the end of the list.
```python
def solution(lst):
    even = 0
    odd = 0
    sum_odd = 0
    while odd < len(lst):
      if (odd + 1) % 2 == 0:
        sum_odd += lst[odd]
        odd += 2
      else:
        even += 2
        odd += 1
    return sum_odd
```
