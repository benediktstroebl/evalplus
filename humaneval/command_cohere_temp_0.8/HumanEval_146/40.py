```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    oddFirsts = [num for num in nums if int(num[0]) % 2 == 1]
    oddLasts = [num for num in nums if int(num[-1]) % 2 == 1]
    return len(oddFirsts & oddLasts)
```

The script employs a logical operator ('&') to filter odd first and last digits simultaneously. This method enhances efficiency by eliminating duplicate counting, optimizing the solution. The function counts numbers that satisfy the condition and returns the total. 

To ensure accuracy, test cases are included to cover different scenarios. These tests validate the function with various input arrays, confirming that it behaves as intended.
