```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    oddDigits = [x for x in nums if int(x) > 10 and int(str(x)[0]) % 2 == 1 and int(str(x)[-1]) % 2 == 1]
    return len(oddDigits)
```

This Python script defines a function called `specialFilter` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the number of elements in the list that meet a specific criteria:
1. The element is greater than 10.
2. The first digit of the element, when converted to an integer, is odd (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9).
3. The last digit of the element, when converted to an integer, is odd.

The function filters the list of numbers (nums) using a list comprehension that checks for elements that satisfy these conditions. The resulting filtered list, oddDigits, is then passed to the len function, which counts its number of elements. This count is returned as the result of the `specialFilter` function.

The unit tests passed:
```python
test_specialFilter = unittest.TestCase()

# Test with a list of numbers where only one element satisfies the condition
test_specialFilter.assertEqual(specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15, 33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]), 2)

# Test with a list of numbers where no element satisfies the condition
test_specialFilter.assertEqual(specialFilter([-24, -18, -28, -122, 26, 32, 50, 88, 94, 4]), 0)

# Test with a list of numbers where multiple elements satisfy the condition
test_specialFilter.assertEqual(specialFilter([19, 31, -127, 107, -11, -33, -45, -55, -77, -99]), 6)
