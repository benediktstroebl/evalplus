```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    oddFirsts = [x for x in nums if int(str(x)[0]) % 2 == 1]
    oddLasts = [x for x in nums if int(str(x)[-1]) % 2 == 1]
    return len(oddFirsts & oddLasts)
```

The above code uses Python's filtering technique and bitwise operators to solve the problem. The `str(x)[0]` extracts the first digit and `str(x)[-1]` extracts the last digit of a number. The `int()` function converts these first and last digits to integers to apply the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the digits are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9). The function returns the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and have both first and last digits odd. 

The following test suite can be used to verify the correctness of the code:
```python
test_suite = [
    ([15, -73, 14, -15, 33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109], 2),
    ([15, -73, 14, -15, 34, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109], 1),
    ([15, -74, 14, -15, 33, -2, -3, 45, 22, 109], 0),
]
```
