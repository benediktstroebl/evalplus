```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    oddFirsts = [x for x in nums if int(str(x)[0]) % 2 == 1]
    oddLasts = [x for x in nums if int(str(x)[-1]) % 2 == 1]
    return len(oddFirsts & oddLasts)
```

The script employs a logical `AND` operator to combine two arrays of odd first and last digits, then returns an integer value representing the count of elements in the intersection of the two arrays. 

The AND operator returns true only if both arguments are true, thereby minimizing the space required for storing intermediate values and also calculating the solution in one pass.

The unit tests for this script could be:
```python
test_specialFilter = [
    ([15, -73, 14, -15], 1),
    ([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109], 2),
    ([15, -74, 14, -16, 33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 110, 109], 3),
]
``` 

Assuming the test cases are in a Python file with the fabric class:
```python
import unittest
tests = unittest.loader.loadTestsFromTestCaseDict(test_specialFilter)
unittest.TextTestRunner().run(tests)
``` 
This will run the test cases and assert that the first argument of each test is the input and the second argument is the expected output of the function.
