```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    oddCounts = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            firstOdd = num % 2
            lastOdd = (num % 10) % 2
            if firstOdd and lastOdd:
                oddCounts += 1
    return oddCounts
```

The solution uses a simple `for` loop that traverses the `nums` array and checks if each number is greater than 10. For each number greater than 10, it further checks if the first digit is odd and the last digit after subtracting the number of two is also odd. If both conditions are satisfied, it increments the `oddCounts` variable by 1. Finally, the function returns the `oddCounts` variable. 

The tests for the solution would look like this:
```python
test_cases = [
    ([15, -73, 14, -15], 1),
    ([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109], 2),
    ([21, 109, 5, 11, 23, 55], 2),
    ([11, 33, 55, 77, 99, 101], 0),
    ([], 0),
    ([], 0),
    ([21, 34, 65, 29, 74, 59], 1),
]

for expected, nums in test_cases:
    actual = specialFilter(nums)
    assert actual == expected, f"Test case failed.\nExpected:{expected}\nActual:{actual}"
```

This block of tests ensures that the `specialFilter` function behaves as expected for a variety of inputs, thereby validating the solution.
