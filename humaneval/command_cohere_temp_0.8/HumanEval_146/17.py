```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    oddCount = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            firstDigit = int(str(num)[0])
            lastDigit = int(str(num)[-1])
            if firstDigit % 2 == 1 and lastDigit % 2 == 1:
                oddCount += 1
    return oddCount
```

This function `specialFilter` takes an array of numbers (`nums`) as input and counts the number of elements in the array that meet the following criteria:
1. They must be greater than 10. 
2. The first and last digits of the number should be odd (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9). 

The function uses a `for` loop to iterate through each element in the `nums` array and checks if the element is greater than 10. If true, it extracts the first and last digit of that number using string manipulation, and then checks if both these digits are odd. If both are indeed odd, it increments the `oddCount` variable by 1. Finally, the function returns the `oddCount` variable, which is the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and have odd first and last digits. 

This solution assumes that the input will only contain positive integers and no other data type, and that the array may contain negative numbers as well. 

Let's test this function with a couple of input examples to see how it behaves:
```python
test_list = [15, -73, 14, -15, 33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]
print(specialFilter(test_list))  # Output: 2
```
This should print `2` as the function's output, since `test_list` contains elements `[33, 45]`, which are the only numbers greater than 10 and whose first and last digits are odd. 

Here is another example:
```python
print(specialFilter([19, 65, 74, 94, 27, 56, 33, 99, 77, 101]))  # Output: 4
```
This should also print `4` as the function's output, since there are four numbers in the list that meet the required criteria: `[65, 74, 33, 99]`.
