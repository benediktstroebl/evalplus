```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    odd_digits = [x for x in nums if int(x) > 10 and int(str(x)[0]) % 2 == 1 and int(str(x)[:-1]) % 2 == 1]
    return len(odd_digits)
```

This function `specialFilter` takes an array of numbers as input and returns the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and have odd first and last digits. To solve the problem, the function filters out the numbers that satisfy the conditions, counts their length, and returns the result. 

Here is a test suite to ensure the function behaves as expected:
```python
def test_specialFilter():
    assert specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15]) == 1
    assert specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]) == 2
    assert specialFilter([11, 99, 505, 507, 519]) == 4

    # Edge cases
    assert specialFilter([]) == 0
    assert specialFilter([123, 985, 183, 993, 77, 1901]) == 0
    assert specialFilter([20, 19, 41, 59, 61]) == 0
```

The test suite contains four test functions to cover different scenarios, ensuring the `specialFilter` function's correctness and robustness in various cases.
