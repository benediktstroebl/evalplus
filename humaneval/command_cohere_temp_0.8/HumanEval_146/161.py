```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    oddCount = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            currDigitSum = sum(map(int, str(num)))
            if currDigitSum % 2 == 1 and currDigitSum != 0:
                oddCount += 1
    return oddCount
```

The function `specialFilter` uses a simple loop to go through each number in the `nums` array. For each number, it first checks if the number is greater than 10. If so, it calculates the sum of its digits (using int() to convert each digit to an integer) and checks if this sum is odd and not zero - this ensures that both the first and last digits are odd. Finally, it counts the number of elements that satisfy this condition and returns this count. 

To better manage odd and even digit sums, the variable `oddCount` is used for counting the odd digit sums. This aggregates the count of numbers that have digits of which the sum is odd and not equal to 0. Thus, the problem's requirement of numbers having odd first and last digits is fulfilled. 

This solution should provide the correct count of elements in the array that conform to the specified criteria. Let me know if you would like me to explain anything in this solution or provide additional assistance!
