```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    oddFirsts = [x for x in nums if int(x[0]) % 2 == 1]
    oddLasts = [x for x in nums if int(x[-1]) % 2 == 1]
    return len(oddFirsts & oddLasts)
```

The script uses Python's array filtering functionality along with the & operator to find the intersection of the two arrays. The function then returns the length of the intersection, which corresponds to the number of elements that meet the specified condition. Test cases are omitted, but you can add your own to ensure the functionality of the script. 
For example:
```python
test_cases = [
    ([15, -73, 14, -15], 1),
    ([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109], 2),
    ([2, 33, 44, 55, 77, 98], 3),
    ([105, 51, 7, -23, 99, 51], 2),
    ([11, 101, 33, -3, 31, 89], 1),
]

for test in test_cases:
    nums, expected = test
    result = specialFilter(nums)
    assert result == expected, f"Expected {expected}, but got {result} for input {nums}"
``` 
This should evaluate the self-contained script to be correct.
