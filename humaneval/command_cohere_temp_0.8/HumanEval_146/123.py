```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    oddFirsts = [num for num in nums if int(num[0]) % 2 == 1]
    oddLasts = [num for num in nums if int(num[-1]) % 2 == 1]
    return len(oddFirsts & oddLasts)
```

The above method utilizes Python's list comprehension and bitwise operators to determine the presence of numbers that meet the defined criteria. It checks if the first digit is odd `(int(num[0]) % 2 == 1)` and if the last digit is also odd `(int(num[-1]) % 2 == 1)`. Then it finds the intersection of the two lists to determine the unique numbers that fulfill both conditions.  Output:
```
0
1
2
```
