```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    oddCount = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            currentDigit = int(str(num)[0])
            lastDigit = int(str(num)[-1])
            if currentDigit % 2 == 1 and lastDigit % 2 == 1:
                oddCount += 1
    return oddCount
```

This function `specialFilter` takes an array of numbers (`nums`) as input and counts the number of elements in the array that meet the specified criteria. It iterates through each number in the `nums` array, checks if the number is greater than 10, and then evaluates if both the first and last digits of the number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9). 

To achieve this, the function extracts the first and last digits of each number using string manipulation and then checks if they are odd. If both digits satisfy the condition, the function increments the `oddCount` variable. Finally, it returns the count of numbers that meet the defined criteria. 

The expected time complexity of this code is O(n), where 'n' is the length of the input array `nums`, as it iterates through each element once. The space complexity is O(1) since it only uses a constant amount of extra space to perform the operation. 

This solution is efficient in terms of time and space and should work well for moderate sizes of the input array.  If you want to improve the readability of the code, you can add variable names that communicate their purpose, such as `num_to_check` or `digit_to_check`, for clarity.  Also, the comments help to better understand the code. 

This solution provides a straightforward way to solve this problem efficiently in Python, without using any additional modules.
