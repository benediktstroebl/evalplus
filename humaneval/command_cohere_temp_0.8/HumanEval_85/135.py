```python
def add(lst):
    even_odd = [el for i, el in enumerate(lst) if i % 2 == 1 and el % 2 == 0]
    return sum(even_odd)
```
This function uses a list comprehension to filter out even integers from the list that are located at odd indices, and then returns their sum. The problem scenario provided examples that illustrate how this function can be effectively used.
