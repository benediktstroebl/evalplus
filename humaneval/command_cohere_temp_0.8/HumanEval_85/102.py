```python
def add(lst):
    even_odd = [el for i, el in enumerate(lst) if i % 2 == 1 and el % 2 == 0]
    return sum(even_odd)
```
This function uses a list comprehension to filter out even integers from the list that are located at odd indices, and then returns their sum. The problem scenario provided unequal spacing in the function description and example, so the solution compensates by assuming that the list elements are separated in an arbitrary fashion.
