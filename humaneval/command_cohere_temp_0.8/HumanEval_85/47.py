```python
def add(lst):
    even_odd = [el for i, el in enumerate(lst) if i % 2 == 1 and el % 2 == 0]
    return sum(even_odd)
```
This function uses a list comprehension to filter out even elements at odd indices from the input list and then returns their sum. Note that the function assumes that the list elements are integers and therefore uses integer addition. Let me know if you need anything else!
