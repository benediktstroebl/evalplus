```python
def add(lst):
    even_odd = [el for i, el in enumerate(lst) if i % 2 == 1 and el % 2 == 0]
    return sum(even_odd)
```
This Python script defines a function named 'add', which takes a list of integers as input. It aims to retrieve even integers occurring at odd indices within the list and calculate their sum. To achieve this, the function employs a list comprehension, iterating through each element and index of the input list. If the index is odd (i.e., divisible by 1 but not by 2) and the element is even (i.e., divisible by 2), it adds the element to the `even_odd` list. Finally, the function returns the sum of the even elements found at odd indices, resulting in the total of 2, the sum of the even elements at odd indices in the given example. 

Here is a test case to test the function: 
```python
test_list = [4, 2, 6, 7]
expected_result = 2
actual_result = add(test_list)
print(f'Expected {expected_result}, got {actual_result}')
```
With this test case, the expected result is 2, since the only even integer at an odd index in the list is 2. When we run this test case, the output should be:
```python
Expected 2, got 2
```
Let's assume the markdown block specifies another example like:
```python
add([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) 
```
This would result in the following output:
```python
7
``` 

Basically, the function adds all even integers at odd indices in the list, resulting in a sum of 7.
