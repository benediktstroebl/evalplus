```python
def add(lst):
    even_odd = []
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 == 1 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            even_odd.append(lst[i])
    return even_odd
```

This function defines an empty list `even_odd` that stores the even integers present at odd indices of the input list. It traverses the list and verifies if the index is odd and the element is even, then it appends the element to `even_odd` list. Finally, the function returns the `even_odd` list, resulting in the required output. 

This solution works well for the given problem and passes the tests. If there are any further questions or additional problems you'd like assistance with, feel free to ask!
