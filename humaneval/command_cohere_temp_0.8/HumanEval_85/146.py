```python
def add(lst):
    even_odd = [el for i, el in enumerate(lst) if i % 2 == 1 and el % 2 == 0]
    return sum(even_odd)
```
This function uses a list comprehension to filter out even integers from the list that are located at odd indices, and then returns their sum. 

Note that this function assumes that the list contains only integers, as list comprehensions are designed to filter elements based on their type. If the list contains elements of other types, the function may return errors or unexpected values.
