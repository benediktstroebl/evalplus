```python
def add(lst):
    even_odd = [num for i, num in enumerate(lst) if i % 2 == 1 and num % 2 == 0]
    return sum(even_odd)
```

The code uses a list comprehension to filter even integers at odd indices from the input list and then sums them using the `sum` function. This solution efficiently solves the problem in a concise manner. Let's discuss the code in detail:
- The code solves the problem of filtering even integers that are present at odd indices in the `lst` list.
- It employs a list comprehension to traverse each index and integer in the `lst` list.
- The `enumerate` function is used to access the index of each integer in the list.
- The comprehension checks if the index is odd (`i % 2 == 1`) and the integer is even (`num % 2 == 0`).
- If the condition is true, the integer is included in the `even_odd` list.
- Finally, the function returns the sum of the integers in the `even_odd` list, which provides the solution to the problem. 

Overall, the code is clear, concise, and effectively solves the given problem. It follows Python's PEP 8 style guide, making it readable and maintainable. It can be easily exported to other languages with minimal modifications, demonstrating its portability.
