```python
def add(lst):
    even_odd = [el for i, el in enumerate(lst) if i % 2 == 1 and el % 2 == 0]
    return sum(even_odd)
```
This function uses a list comprehension to filter out even integers from the list that are located at odd indices, and then returns their sum. 

Note that this function assumes that the list contains only integers and that it is not empty, as these assumptions were made in the problem statement.
