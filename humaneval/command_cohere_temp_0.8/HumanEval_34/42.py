```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list."""
    l = list(set(l))
    l.sort()
    return l
```

This Python script defines a function called unique which takes one argument, l, which is a list. This function sorts the elements of l, removes any duplicates, and then returns the unique, sorted elements. 

The tests for this function are not provided in the original problem, but the function should correctly solve the problem as stated.
