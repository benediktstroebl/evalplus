```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list."""
    l = list(set(l))
    l.sort()
    return l
```

This Python script defines a function unique that takes a list l as an argument and returns a sorted list of unique elements present in l. The function uses the built-in `set` function to remove duplicate elements and then sorts the remaining elements before returning the modified list.

This solution should solve the problem as required in the markdown code block. Let me know if you would like me to provide any further assistance.
