```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list."""
    l = list(set(l))
    l.sort()
    return l
```

This Python script defines a function `unique` that takes a list `l` as an argument and returns a sorted list of unique elements. The function uses the built-in `set` function to remove duplicate elements from the list, and then uses the `sort` function to sort the unique elements. 

To ensure the function works as expected, let's test it against a few scenarios.

Here is a test code segment:
```python
# Test 1: Basic test of unique function
def test_unique():
    # Input list with duplicates
    input_list = [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]
    expected_list = [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
    result = unique(input_list)
    assert result == expected_list
    assert len(result) == len(set(input_list))
```

In the test code, we first generate an **input list** with duplicates to verify the `unique` function's functionality. The expected result is obtained by applying the function to the input, and the assert statements check that the result is as expected and that it contains unique elements from the input list. 

This test ensures that the `unique` function correctly sorts and removes duplicate elements from a list. 

The `unique` function can be used directly within Markdown to solve the problem statement as demonstrated below:
```python
```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list."""
    l = list(set(l))
    l.sort()
    return l
```

```python
# Input list with duplicates
list_with_duplicates = [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]
print(unique(list_with_duplicates))
```

This would give a sorted unique elements in a list. 

The `unique` function can solve a variety of problems that involve sorting and removing duplicate elements.  It can be used to filter lists of unique items in a particular context, such as unique colors or fruits in a dataset.  It is versatile and can be applied to various scenarios where a sorted list of distinct elements is required.  It is also useful in combination with other functions to remove duplicate elements based on certain criteria, such as unique items based on specific attributes.  This makes it a valuable tool for data cleaning and transformation tasks.
