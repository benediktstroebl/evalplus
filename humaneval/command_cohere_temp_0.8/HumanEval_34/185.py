```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list"""
    seen = set()
    result = [x for x in l if not (x in seen or seen.add(x))]
    return sorted(result)
```

This function utilizes a set, `seen`, to efficiently track unique elements. It iterates through the input list, checking if each element is already in the `seen` set. If not, it adds it to both the set and the result list. Finally, the function sorts the result list to ensure a consistent order. 

This approach guarantees efficiency in terms of both time and memory usage. It provides an effective solution for the task of finding sorted unique elements within a list. 

You can validate the functionality of the code by calling the function with a sample input list and comparing the output with the expected result. 

Here is an example of how you can test this function: 
```python
test_list = [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]
expected_result = [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]

result = unique(test_list)
print(result)  # Output: [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]

assert result == expected_result
``` 
The output will confirm that the function produces the expected sorted unique elements. 

This function is both efficient and easy to incorporate into various Python projects, aiding in solving this list uniqueness challenge.  If you encounter any complexities or need assistance with additional concepts, don't hesitate to ask for guidance or further clarifications.
