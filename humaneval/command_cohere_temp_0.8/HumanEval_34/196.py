```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list."""
    l = list(set(l))
    l.sort()
    return l
```
This Python script defines a function unique that takes a list l as input and returns a sorted list of unique elements present in l. The function first converts the list into a set to remove any duplicate elements, then converts it back to a list and sorts the unique elements in ascending order. 

The documentation string at the beginning of the code provides a brief description of the function's purpose, which is to return a sorted list of unique elements from a given input list.

This code snippet can be imported and used as a module in other Python scripts that need to manipulate lists and retrieve unique elements. Furthermore, the function unique can be invoked anywhere in the script where it is imported, enabling versatile and convenient usage within the project.
