```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list."""
    l = list(set(l))
    l.sort()
    return l
```

This Python script defines a function called `unique` that takes a list `l` as an input. It removes duplicate elements from the list using the `set()` function, which automatically eliminates duplicate values by converting the list into a set and then back to a list. The sorted unique elements are then returned. The function is documented with a comment that describes its purpose and provides a usage example in the format of a Python unittest. This example test is not enclosed in a `test_` function, meaning it will not be executed as a test but is provided to illustrate how the function is intended to be used.
