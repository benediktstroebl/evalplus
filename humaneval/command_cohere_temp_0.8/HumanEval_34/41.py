```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list"""
    l = list(set(l))
    l.sort()
    return l
```

This Python script defines a function unique that takes a list l as an argument and returns a sorted list of unique elements from l. The function uses the built-in Python set to automatically filter out duplicate elements, and the sorted function to sort the unique elements in ascending order. 

To further verify the functionality of the unique function, consider the following test cases:
```python
# Test case with a list of integers
test_list = [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]
expected_result = [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
result = unique(test_list)
assert result == expected_result

# Test case with a list of strings
test_list = ["apple", "apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "kiwi"]
expected_result = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi"]
result = unique(test_list)
assert result == expected_result

# Test case with a list of mixed data types
test_list = [1, "apple", 3.14, "banana", 0, "cherry"]
expected_result = [0, 1, 3.14, "apple", "banana", "cherry"]
result = unique(test_list)
assert result == expected_result
```

These test cases can be used to validate the correctness of the unique function with a variety of input lists. 

Let's use the first test case as an example:
```python
test_list = [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]
expected_result = [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
result = unique(test_list)
assert result == expected_result
```

This test case checks whether the unique function sorts and removes duplicates from the input list `[5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]`. The expected result is `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]`, so we can use the `assert` statement to check if the result of the function call `unique(test_list)` is equal to the expected result. 

The output of this test case would be:
```python
>>> assert result == expected_result
```

If the result of the function unique(test_list) is equal to expected_result, the assert statement does not throw an error and the test passes. 

The same steps can be applied to the other test cases to adequately test the unique function. 
Let me know if I can help with any further analysis or testing!

 ### Analyze Efficiency 

The presented solution leverages Python's built-in set data structure to filter out duplicate elements from the list, which has an average time complexity of O(n) for this specific task. This is efficient and optimally performs the filtering operation on the input list. The subsequent sorting of the unique elements, accomplished by Python's built-in sort method, has an average time complexity of O(n log n). As a whole, the function unique has an average time complexity of O(n).

In terms of space complexity, the set appropriation alone engenders a space complexity of O(n). This is because each unique element in the list necessitates its own storage in the set. The sorting
