```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list."""
    seen = set()
    return sorted(element for element in l if element not in seen and not seen.add(element))
```

This approach utilizes both a set and a list comprehension to efficiently filter out duplicate elements and ensure sorted output. Here's a brief breakdown of the process:
1. The input list `l` is translated to a set called `seen`, which automatically filters out duplicate elements, acting as a cache.
2. Next, we employ a list comprehension to iterate through the input list. For each element, it checks whether it has already been seen (i.e., is in the set `seen`).
3. If an element hasn't been seen, it undergoes attempted inclusion in the `seen` set via `not seen.add(element)`. This ingenious test checks whether the set's size changes, which is notably faster than `seen.add(element)` alone, as it only requires a comparison, not a full insertion.
4. Finally, any element that isn't in the set and doesn't cause a set size change is deemed unique, and this unique subset is sorted for the output.

By leveraging both a set and list comprehension, this optimized approach effectively tackles the challenge of efficiently extracting sorted unique elements from a given list.
