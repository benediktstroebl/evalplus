```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list."""
    l = list(set(l))
    l.sort()
    return l
```
This Python script defines a function unique that takes a list l as an argument and returns a sorted list of unique elements from l. The function uses the built-in set function to remove duplicate elements, and the list() function to convert the set back to a list. The sort() function is then used to sort the unique elements. 

The docstring at the beginning of the code provides documentation for the function, indicating that it returns a sorted list of unique elements from a given list.

If there are any tests that need to be run to validate this function, they can be added below the function definition. 
```python
# Tests
assert unique([1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 4]) == [1, 2, 3, 4]
assert unique([1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]) == [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
 Passing the unique function through a testing framework like pytest or unittest will result in tests that validate the correctness of the function. In this case, the tests assert that the function returns the expected output for two different inputs.
