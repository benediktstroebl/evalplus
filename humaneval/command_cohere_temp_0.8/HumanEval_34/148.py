```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list"""
    l = list(set(l))
    l.sort()
    return l
```
This Python script defines a function unique that takes a list l as input and returns a sorted list of unique elements within l. Here's a breakdown of the function:
1. The input list l is converted into a set using the set() function. This removes any duplicate elements from the list, automatically eliminating duplicate entries.
2. The transformed set is converted back into a list using the list() function.
3. The resulting list is sorted in ascending order using the sort() method.
4. The sorted, unique list is returned as the output of the function. 

This approach ensures that the function correctly produces a list of unique elements, sorted in ascending order, resulting in an efficient and reliable solution. Let me know if you would like me to explain anything else related to this problem or the code I provided.
