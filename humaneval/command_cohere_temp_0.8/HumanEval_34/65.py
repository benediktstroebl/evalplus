```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list."""
    l = list(set(l))
    l.sort()
    return l
```

This Python script defines a function unique that takes a list l as an argument and returns a sorted list of unique elements from l. The function uses the built-in Python set to automatically filter out duplicate elements, and the sorted function to sort the unique elements in ascending order. 

To ensure the function performs as expected, it is recommended to include tests in the code snippet, for example:
```python
def test_unique():
    # Test basic functionality
    assert unique([1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

    # Test with nested lists
    assert unique([1, 2, [3, 3, 4], 4, 5, 6]) == [1, 2, [3, 4], 5, 6]

    # Test with tuples
    assert unique([(1, 1), (2, 3), (4, 9), (6, 3)]) == [(1, 1), (2, 3), (4, 9), (6, 3)]

    # Test with other iterables
    assert unique([1, 2, 3, 'a', 'a', 'b', 'c']) == [1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c']
```

This allows for testing the function's behavior across different scenarios and ensuring its correctness.
