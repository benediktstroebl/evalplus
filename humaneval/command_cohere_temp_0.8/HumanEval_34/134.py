```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list."""
    l = list(set(l))
    l.sort()
    return l
```

This Python script defines a function called `unique` that takes a list `l` as input. It removes duplicate elements from the list using the `set()` function, which automatically eliminates duplicate values by converting the list into a set and then back to a list. The sorted unique elements are then returned. The function includes a docstring that describes its purpose and provides a usage example in the form of a test case that returns the expected result.
