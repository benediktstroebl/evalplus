```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list."""
    l = list(set(l))
    l.sort()
    return l
```
This Python script defines a function unique that takes a list l as an argument and returns a sorted list of unique elements from l. The function first converts the list into a set to remove duplicate elements, then converts the set back into a list and sorts it before returning the result.  The "Unique Elements" problem is solved by using the unique function to return the sorted unique elements in the list.  This approach ensures that the resulting list contains only unique elements and is sorted in ascending order.  This passes the given tests.
