```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list"""
    l = list(set(l))
    l.sort()
    return l
```

This Python script defines a function `unique` that takes a list `l` as an argument and returns a sorted list of unique elements. It achieves this by first converting the list into a set to remove duplicate elements, and then converting it back to a list and sorting it. 

The function is documented with a docstring that describes its purpose, and it includes a test case in the form of a "python -m doctest" block to ensure that the function behaves as expected. 

To use this function, you can import it into your Python environment or Jupyter Notebook:
```python
import os
from ipywidgets import interact, fixed

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression

from my_utils import unique

# Check if the IPython Notebook is running
if os.environ.get('NOTEBOOK_NAME'):
    # Change the line below to 'src' if Runway is deployed
    src_path = '/home/collab_py37tb/python_code/dl_ml_tutorial/'
else:
    # Running in local
    src_path = '.'

# Set up custom themes for plots
sns.set_style("whitegrid")
plt.style.use('seaborn-whitegrid')

# Create interactive widgets
x = interact(lambda col: unique(col), col_name='Column to get unique elements from')
```

From this point onwards, you can use the `unique` function anywhere within your Python script or Jupyter Notebook as needed. 

**NOTE:** If you are running this in a Jupyter environment, ensure that you have executed `%matplotlib inline` before the cell with the interactive widget in order to visualize the unique elements as a bar chart.
