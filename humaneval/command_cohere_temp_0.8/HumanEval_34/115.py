```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list"""
    seen = set()
    return sorted(element for element in l if element not in seen and not seen.add(element))
```

This approach utilizes both a set and a list comprehension to efficiently filter out duplicates and sort the remaining unique elements. Notably, the set `seen` keeps track of elements encountered, and the list comprehension 'element for element in l if ...' selectively includes elements from the input `l` only if they have not been previously noted in `seen`. 

The previously provided example usage demonstrates this new function on a sample list.
