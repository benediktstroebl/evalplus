```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list"""
    seen = set()
    return sorted(element for element in l if element not in seen and not seen.add(element))
```

This approach utilizes both a set and a list comprehension to efficiently filter out duplicate elements and ensure uniqueness. The 'not seen.add(element)' expression checks whether an element is about to be added to the set, effectively determining whether it has already been seen. 

The docstring of the function is also updated to reflect the new implementation. 

To ensure the robustness of the function, consider running it with extreme input values and corner cases to confirm its reliability. For instance, you could check what unique([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 11, 12, 13, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100]) to verify its behavior. 

I hope this revised version meets your requirements. Let me know if you need anything else!
