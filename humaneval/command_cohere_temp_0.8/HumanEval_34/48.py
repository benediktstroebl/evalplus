```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list."""
    l = list(set(l))
    l.sort()
    return l
```
This Python script defines a function unique that takes a list l as input and returns a sorted list of unique elements present in l. It does so in two steps:
1. First, it removes duplicate elements from l by converting l to a set (which only allows unique elements) and then converting it back to a list, eliminating any duplicates.
2. Next, it sorts the unique elements using the sort() method, ensuring that the output list has distinct elements in a particular order. The function is encapsulated in a self-contained code block with a docstring that describes its purpose and provides a test case example, making it modular and easily understandable for anyone reading the code.
