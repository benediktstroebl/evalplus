```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list."""
    l = list(set(l))
    l.sort()
    return l
```

This Python script defines a function called `unique` that takes a list `l` as an argument. It aims to efficiently find the unique elements in the given list and return them in sorted order. 

The function utilizes two common Python techniques: set enumeration and list sorting. Here's how it achieves this:
1. **Set Enumeration**: The line `l = list(set(l))` transforms the original list `l` into a new list where duplicate elements are removed. This is done using Python's set abstraction, which inherently only allows unique elements. This step ensures that no duplicate values remain in the list.
2. **List Sorting**: After removing duplicates, the function sorts the remaining unique elements using the `sort()` method. This ensures that the final returned list is sorted in ascending order.

The function then returns the sorted unique elements, achieving the goal of finding the distinct elements in the original list while also ordering them systematically.
