```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list."""
    l = list(set(l))
    l.sort()
    return l
```

This Python script defines a function `unique` that takes a list `l` as an argument and returns a sorted list of unique elements. The function first creates a set from the input list, which automatically removes any duplicate elements, then converts the set back to a list and sorts it before returning the result. 

The function includes a docstring that provides a descriptive explanation of what it does, as well as a test example showing how to use it. The example usage demonstrates how the function can be invoked with a sample input list, and it includes the expected output resulting from applying the function to that input.
