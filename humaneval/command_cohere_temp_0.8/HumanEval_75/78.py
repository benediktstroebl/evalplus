```python
def is_multiply_prime(n):
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37]
    factors = set(int(i) for i in range(1, int(n ** .5) + 1) if n % i == 0)
    return not any(factor in factors for prime in primes for factor in primes if prime ** 3 > factors[factor] or factors[factor] > prime ** 2)
```
The function uses a list of known primes to check if the given number is divisible by any prime not exceeding its square root. And also, checks if any of these divisors are themselves the product of 3 primes to return True if the number is the product of 3 primes and False otherwise.
