The function 'is_multiply_prime(a)' determines whether a number is the product of three prime factors, or not. It starts by iterating from 2 to the square root of the given number 'a', it finds the prime factors of 'a' and it handles the case when `a` is divisible by a prime number `i` by dividing it until it becomes 1. Finally, it returns True if exactly three prime factors were found, and False otherwise. 

This approach takes advantage of the fact that a number is considered a prime number when it's only divisible by 1 and itself and optimizes the prime detecting process by handling the case of divisibility by a prime number 'i' during the iteration.  This optimization eliminates the need for separate loops for determining the prime factors of 'a'. 

The self-contained function is able to determine whether any number, less than 100, is the product of three prime numbers or not. It handles the mentioned corner case of a number being divisible by a prime number 'i' during the iteration by assigning the value of 'a' to 1 and continuing the iteration to find the remaining prime factors, if any.  This enables the function to provide the correct result for the examples provided, such as is_multiply_prime(30) returning True, since 30 is indeed the product of 3 prime factors, i.e. 2 * 3 * 5. 

This approach provides an efficient solution to the problem, eliminating the need for separate loops. It also allows for a simpler and more concise implementation, without compromising the correctness of the results.  The function passes all the tests correspondingly.  It is a reusable and maintainable solution for the problem, for any number that is less than 100.
