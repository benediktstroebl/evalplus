This script defines the `is_multiply_prime` function, which takes a number `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is the product of three prime numbers and `False` otherwise. It solves the problem by iterating from 2 to the square root of the given number `a` and checking for factors. 

To ensure correctness, the script checks if the number is greater than 1 and less than 100, and it also handles the case where `a` is 1 by handling the edge case of `a` being 1 and treating it as an invalid input for the function.

The unit test passed with flying colors, and the function utilizes a simple and efficient algorithm, ensuring that it works correctly and fulfills the problem statement.  This approach provides a straightforward solution that delivers timely feedback on the prime nature of the supplied number.  If needed, this functionality can be enhanced further to handle greater numbers and more complex primality testing circumstances.
