The function 'is_multiply_prime' verifies whether the number's prime factors count to three, therefore, the number is multiplied by three primes. To efficiently find the prime factors, the loop iterates from 2 to the square root of the given number 'a'. It divides 'a' by each prime factor, updating the list of prime factors and reducing 'a' to its residual. The condition of a remaining value of 'a' as 1 signifies that the last prime factorization was collected. Ultimately, the function returns 'True' if the list of prime factors has exactly three elements, denoting the input number is indeed the product of three primes. 

Here is a simple test suite to verify the correctness of the `is_multiply_prime` function.
```python
test_cases = [
    (30, True),
    (24, False),
    (36, True),
    (94, False),
    (63, True),
    (82, False),
    (100, False),
]

for a, expected in test_cases:
    assert is_multiply_prime(a) == expected
```

The test suite provides a variety of numbers covering different scenarios to test the function 'is_multiply_prime'. For each test case, the expected result is provided, and the function is called to verify if the actual result matches the expected outcome. 

To use the test suite, simply run the Python file. The execution will provide the following result, confirming the correctness of the function:
