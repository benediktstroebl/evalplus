```python
def is_multiply_prime(a):
    prime_test = [0, 0, 0]
    for i in range(2, a):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, int(i ** 0.5) + 1):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            prime_test[0] += 1
        else:
            prime_test[1] += 1
    if prime_test[0] > 0 and prime_test[0] == prime_test[1] == 1:
        return True
    return False

The code employs a straightforward algorithm to inspect the divisibility of the number `i` by all integers ranging from 2 to its square root. A prime number is determined if the number is not divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself. The function subsequently determines whether the given number is a multiple of three primes by decomposing it into its constituent prime factors. 

To do so, it determines whether the number is divisible by any integer between 2 and its square root. The variable `prime_test` is a list of three integers that represents the number of identified prime factors, non-prime factors, and divisors, respectively. The function returns True if all three elements are equal to 1, indicating that the number is a product of three primes.

Keep in mind that this algorithm has a time complexity of O(sqrt(a)), where 'a' is the given number, as it only needs to check the divisibility against integers ranging up to the square root of the given number. This is an optimization compared to checking all integers up to 'a'. 

Let's make a few comments on the code so it is easier to understand the logic: 

1. PRIME_TEST is a list of three integers that is used to gauge the number of prime factors, non-prime factors, and divisors. This is going to be updated as the various factors of the number are identified. 
2. The outer most loop runs from i = 2 to a, which are the potential prime factors of the number `a`. 
3. The nested loop runs from j = 2 to i ** 0.5 + 1. This covers all potential divisors of `i`. 
4. The logic `if i % j == 0` checks whether `i` is divisible by `j`. If this is true, then `i` is not a prime number, and the `prime_test[1]` should be incremented. 
5. If the loop completes without finding a divisor for `i`, then it is a prime number, and `prime_test[0]` should be incremented. 

After the loops complete, the function checks `prime_test[0]`. If `prime_test[0]` is greater than 0, and both `prime_test[0]` and `prime_test[1]` are equal to 1, then the function returns `True`, as the number is a product of three primes. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This approach gives a boolean response to the query about whether the given number is the product of three primes by examining its constituent factors and counting the number of prime and non-prime factors.
