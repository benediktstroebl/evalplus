```python
def is_multiply_prime(n):
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37]
    factors = set(int(i) for i in range(1, int(n ** .5) + 1) if n % i == 0)
    return len(factors) == 3 and factors & set(primes) == factors
```

The function `is_multiply_prime` checks if a given number is the multiplication of three prime numbers. It first calculates the factors of the number and then checks if there are exactly three of them and that all are contained in the list of primes less than 100. The set operations are used to remove duplication and check for equality. 
The unit test that can verify the correctness of the approach is provided above. It can be converted into a rebus puzzle, an image, or a series of paragraphs corresponding to the different test cases.

```python
# Testing the is_multiply_prime function

def test_is_multiply_prime():
    assert is_multiply_prime(30) == True
    assert is_multiply_prime(52) == True
    assert is_multiply_prime(104) == True
    assert is_multiply_prime(105) == False
    assert is_multiply_prime(91) == False
    assert is_multiply_prime(27) == False
