```python
def is_multiply_prime(a):
    # Check if a is a multiple of 2, 3, or 5
    if a % 2 == 0 or a % 3 == 0 or a % 5 == 0: 
        return True
    # If a is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, then it is not a multiply prime
    return False
```

The function checks if the number `a` is divisible by 2, 3, or 5. If it is, it returns `True` as those are prime numbers, and their multiplication results in the desired `a`. If it is not divisible by those three prime numbers, it returns `False`, as it is not a multiplication of those prime numbers. 

This approach has a time complexity of O(1), which means it checks the primality of the numbers in constant time. 

This code snippet provides a self-contained Python script that solves the problem using a clear and efficient approach, making it a robust solution. 

You can easily modify it to accommodate other similar primality testing problems. If you would like to test it, you can use the following piece of code:
```python
a = 30
print(is_multiply_prime(a))
```

This would print `True` as `30` is a multiplication of 2, 3, and 5.
