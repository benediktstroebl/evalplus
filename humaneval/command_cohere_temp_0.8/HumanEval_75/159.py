```python
def is_multiply_prime(n):
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37]
    factors = set(int(i) for i in range(1, int(n ** .5) + 1) if n % i == 0)
    return len(factors) == 3 and factors & set(primes) == factors
```

The function `is_multiply_prime` checks if a number is the multiplication of three primes. It first calculates the factors of the number and then checks that there are exactly three of them and that they are a subset of the known prime factors. 

The set of known prime numbers (`primes`) is limited to mitigate the possibility of worst-case performance in factorization by `O(n^3)` with `O(n)` factorization improvements such as [the `math.sqrt()` function]. 

Let's say that a more efficient solution is required or that the upper limit is higher, and one wants to use more advanced prime factorization methods like [the `primeira` library] or [Cunningham's Algorithm]. In that case, the set of primes can be replaced with a generator that only calls the optimized factorization methods for primes, keeping the checkpoint at which the number was found to be composite.
