```python
def is_multiply_prime(n):
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37]
    divisors = []
    
    for d in primes:
        if n % d == 0:
            divisors.append(d)
            if len(divisors) == 3:
                return True
    
    return False
```

This `is_multiply_prime` function iterates over all numbers less than `100` which are primes (proven by extensive empirical evidence but not formally proven to be prime). It then checks if the given number `n` is divisible by each prime. If it finds three distinct divisors, it returns `True`, if it finds less than three divisors or none at all, it returns `False`. 

In the example provided, `is_multiply_prime(30)` would return `True` since `30` is divisible by 2, 3, and 5, which are three distinct prime numbers. 

This approach has an O(Primes * NumDigits) complexity, where Primes are the numbers less than 100 which are primes and NumDigits is the number of digits in the integer `n`. Although this is efficient for the given constraints, note that this approach is not scalable should the constraints change. More advanced prime detection algorithms could be employed to improve upon this but would necessarily be more complex and require additional dependencies.
