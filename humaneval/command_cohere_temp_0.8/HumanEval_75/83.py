```python
def is_multiply_prime(n):
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37]
    divisors = [div for div in primes if n % div == 0]
    return len(divisors) == 3
```

The function `is_multiply_prime` checks if the given number is the multiplication of three prime numbers. It does so by first assuming that the number is divided by two, then three, and so on, until it is divided (with remainder) by one of the prime numbers in the list `primes`. If it is divisible by some prime number, the loop is interrupted and the function checks if there are exactly three divisors. If so, then the given number is the product of three prime numbers and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the number is not the product of three prime numbers, and the function returns `False`. 

Note that this approach leverages the fact that a number is prime if it is divisible only by 1 and itself and that a composite number has more than two divisors. 

Also, the list of primes `primes` is a list of the first primes less than 100, which covers all the necessary primes for the given `n` values that are less than 100,000. 

This approach has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)) for each test, as it runs through the list of primes which contains nth root of n elements. However, it is a necessary approach to solve this problem efficiently, as exhaustively checking for divisibility would take too long for larger numbers. 

This solution is a efficient and effective way to check if a given number is the product of three prime numbers, as it will rarely return a false positive or false negative. 

To test it you can run the following code:
```python
import unittest

def is_multiply_prime(n):
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37]
    divisors = [div for div in primes if n % div == 0]
    return len(divisors) == 3

class TestIsMultiplyPrime(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_is_multiply_prime(self):
        self.assertTrue(is_multiply_prime(30))
        self.assertTrue(is_multiply_prime(51))
        self.assertTrue(is_multiply_prime(41))
        self.assertFalse(is_multiply_prime(28))
        self.assertFalse(is_multiply_prime(32))
        self.assertFalse(is_multiply_prime(100))

    def test_is_multiply_prime_edge_cases(self):
        self.assertFalse(is_multiply_prime(1))
        self.assertFalse(is_multiply_prime(13))
        self.assertFalse(is_multiply_prime(25))
        self.assertFalse(is_multiply_prime(27))

    def test_is_multiply_prime_timeout(self):
        self.assertTrue(is_multiply_prime(3))
        self.assertTrue(is_multiply_prime(5))
        self.assertTrue(is_multiply_prime(7))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This code will run the `unittest` module, which is a Python testing framework that enables creating and running tests within a Python script. In this case, we have three test functions: `test_is_multiply_prime`, `test_is
