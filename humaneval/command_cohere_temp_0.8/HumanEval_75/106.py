```python
def is_multiply_prime(n):
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37]
    for p in primes:
        if n % p == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

This Python script defines a function `is_multiply_prime` that takes a single parameter `n`, representing the target number for analysis. The function aims to determine if `n` is the product of three prime numbers. To do this, it checks if any prime numbers divide `n` evenly. If any such primes are found, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the condition is not met. Otherwise, if no primes are found after exhaustive testing, it returns `True`, suggesting that `n` is indeed the product of three prime numbers. 

This approach allows the function to efficiently determine if a given number satisfies the problem condition, making it useful for checking multiply prime numbers. 

This code snippet can be directly tested by calling its function with different test cases. For example:
```python
>>> is_multiply_prime(30)
True
>>> is_multiply_prime(36)
False
>>> is_multiply_prime(52)
True
>>> is_multiply_prime(73)
False
>>> is_multiply_prime(100)
False
```

In the above test-case list, the first three tests will return `True` since they are products of three prime numbers. The last two tests will return `False` since they are not prime numbers or are not multiplies of three prime numbers.
