The code employs a recursive approach to determine if the number `a` is the product of three prime numbers. It first checks if `a` is less than or equal to 1 or greater than 100, returning false if so. It then begins iterating through potential divisors, starting from 2 and up to the square root of `a`. If no divisors are found after the first loop, it proceeds to examine pair factors. It checks if each element in the pair is greater than 1 and less than 100. After that, it enters a recursive call to check if the element is a multiply prime or not. Finally, it returns True if all elements in the pair are prime and False otherwise. The overall time complexity of this code is O(N*log(N)). 

The code's main idea is to divide the multiply number into three primes and then check each division result to see if it is prime. You can get the complete idea by reading the commented version of the code.
