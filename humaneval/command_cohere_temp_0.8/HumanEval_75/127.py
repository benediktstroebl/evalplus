```python
def is_multiply_prime(n):
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37]
    factors = set(int(i) for i in range(1, int(n ** .5) + 1) if n % i == 0)
    return not any(factor in factors for prime in primes for factor in primes for prime in primes if prime * prime == factor)
```

The function `is_multiply_prime` checks if the given number is the product of 3 or more prime factors. The script iterates through factors from 1 to the square root of the input number and checks if the factor is a prime. Then, using the `any` method, it checks whether any of the primes is a multiplication of two other primes that belong to the set of potential factors. If there is such a multiplication, the function returns False, otherwise, it returns True. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(is_multiply_prime(30))
```
The output should be:
```
True
```

This output confirms that the function correctly identifies 30 as a multiplication of three prime numbers: 2 * 3 * 5.
