```python
def is_multiply_prime(a):
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]
    factors = set(int(i) for i in range(1, a + 1) if a % i == 0)
    return not any(factor in factors for prime in primes for factor in primes if prime ** 2 > factor or a // prime ** 2 >= Math.sqrt(a))
```

The function `is_multiply_prime(a)` checks if the given number `a` is the product of **3 or more prime factors**. The function does so by first creating a list of prime numbers up to `a` and then checking whether the number `a` has fewer than 3 factors among the primes, not exceeding the square root of `a`. If so, the function returns `True`, else it returns `False`. 

This approach aims to optimize the process by avoiding multiple iterations and checking for each potential prime factor up to the square root of `a`. 

Let's take `a = 30` as an example. The code will first create a list of prime factors up to `30` and then check if any of the prime factors appear more than once in the list `factors`. In the case of `30`, both `2` and `3` appear once in `factors`, and `5` appears twice. Since the condition is not met, the function will return `False`.
