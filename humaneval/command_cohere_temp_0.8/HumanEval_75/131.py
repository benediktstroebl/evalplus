```python
def is_multiply_prime(a):
    # check if a is less than 100
    if a > 100:
        return False
    
    # check if a is the multiplication of 3 primes
    prime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37]
    
    for prime in prime_numbers:
        if a % prime == 0:
            return True
    
    return False
```
The function checks whether the given number is greater than 100, as described in the MD code block, and whether it can be divided exactly by any of the prime numbers from the `prime_numbers` list. If it can, then the function returns `True`, and if not, it returns `False`.  This algorithm has a time complexity of O(sqrt(a)) where a is the given number.  This is efficient, because the upper bound of the function is 100, which means the function will always be called with a <= 100. Also, we know that the 100th prime is 196, which means that we only need to check primes less than 100 to determine if a is prime. 

This approach provides a balanced trade-off between time complexity and required resources, making it an efficient solution for the given problem.  It is important to have a balance between the size/complexity of the input and the size/complexity of the code to reach the optimal efficiency.  This is one of the reasons to have unit tests.  With them, you can safely optimize your code, knowing that if something breaks, you will be notified.  You can see below a self-contained unit test for the function: 

```python
def test_is_multiply_prime():
    assert is_multiply_prime(30) == True
    assert is_multiply_prime(52) == True
    assert is_multiply_prime(97) == False
    assert is_multiply_prime(100) == False
``` 

This test suite covers all the cases mentioned in the MD code block.  Usually, it is best to have many simple tests that cover different cases instead of having a few complex ones.  This will make it easier to maintain your test suite and reducing the likelihood of having false positives or negatives.  ThereFor, the best approach is to have many simple unit tests, which verify basic behavior of the function in various cases, as shown in the code below.  This will increase the confidence of passing the 100 threshold in the future without necessarily increasing the code complexity.  Let me know if I can be of further assistance with any improvements or clarifications.
