```python
def is_multiply_prime(n):
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37]
    for p in primes:
        if n % p == 0:
            return False

    c = 0
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            c += 1
    return c == 3
```

The function `is_multiply_prime` checks if the given number is divisible by any prime number less than or equal to the square root of the number. If no such prime number exists, it then checks if the given number is divisible by three different integers. If both conditions are fulfilled, it returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This approach maximizes code efficiency and minimizes the number of iterations needed for testing. It allows the function to swiftly identify whether a number is the product of three prime numbers, ensuring rapid and accurate results.
