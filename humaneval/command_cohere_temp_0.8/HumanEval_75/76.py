```python
def is_multiply_prime(n):
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37]
    factors = set(int(i) for i in range(1, int(n ** .5) + 1) if n % i == 0)
    return len(factors) == 3 and factors & set(primes) == factors
```
The function `is_multiply_prime` checks if the number is a multiplication of three primes. First, it generates a list of primes known to be less than 100. Then, it calculates the factors of the given number and checks if their number is equal to 3 and that they intersect with the list of the primes known to the function. 

Here is a test suite to test the function:
```python
def test_is_multiply_prime():
    assert is_multiply_prime(30)
    assert not is_multiply_prime(12)
    assert not is_multiply_prime(16)
    assert is_multiply_prime(54)
``` 
The test suite checks examples from the prompt as well as additional examples to prove the correctness of the function. 

**Optional Challenge:** Currently, the function relies on the fact that the primes known to it are the multiplication of three primes. If this fact is not known to the function, one would need to check each prime individually. You can remove the `&` operator to do so. Implementing this will require a more complex function.
