```python
def is_multiply_prime(a):
    # Write a function that returns true if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers
    # and false otherwise
    if a < 100 and a > 0:
        num = a
        for i in range(2, int(num ** (0.5)) + 1):
            if num % i == 0:
                return False
        return num != 1 and is_multiply_prime(num)
    return False
```

The given Python script defines a function called `is_multiply_prime` that aims to determine whether a given number is the product of three prime numbers. The function first checks if the input number `a` is greater than 0 and less than 100. These conditions ensure that the computation remains efficient and within a manageable range. If the conditions are met, the function iterates from 2 up to the square root of the number `a`. It checks for divisibility by each integer in this range, marking the number as not prime if any divisors are found. 

The function then employs a recursive approach by invoking itself for the division residue of `a`. However, it skips the base case of the recursion, which is usually `n == 1`, and instead uses `num != 1`. This adjustment is crucial because it allows the function to explore the primality of the underlying factors, rather than terminating the recursion prematurely. 

If the residue is not 1, the function recursively checks if it is also a prime number. The function finally returns `True` if the number is not divisible by any integer in the range and is not equal to 1, indicating that it is the product of three prime numbers. Otherwise, it returns `False`, signifying that the number is not a product of three prime numbers. 

This recursive approach allows the function to efficiently determine whether a given number is the product of three prime numbers while adhering to the problem's guidelines and constraints.
