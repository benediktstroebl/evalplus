```

The function `is_multiply_prime` verifies if the given number is greater than 1 and less than 100. It then iterates through the number's prime factors, counting them and determining if there are precisely three of them. The function returns `True` if there are three prime factors and `False` if there are fewer or more. 

This approach ensures that the code efficiently conducts prime factorization and accurately determines if the given number fits the provided criteria. 

To make the code more efficient, these are some recommendations: 
- Implement optimization techniques to enhance performance, such as caching prime numbers to avoid repeated computations.
- Utilize the `math` module's `sqrt(a)` function to swiftly identify the square root and simplify the loop for factoring.
- Employ list comprehension to streamline the extraction of prime factors.

Ensure you consider these suggestions based on the problem's complexity and constraints to achieve a balanced solution. 

This approach allows the code to efficiently manage prime factorization while maintaining its clarity and precision in identifying multiples of three prime numbers.
