Here's a Python function that solves the problem you've outlined:
```python
def minSubArraySum(nums):
    min_sum = nums[0]
    max_sum = nums[0]
    for n in nums[1:]:
        min_sum = min(min_sum + n, n)
        max_sum = max(max_sum + n, n)
    return min(min_sum, max_sum)
```
This function uses dynamic programming to keep track of both the minimum and maximum sum horizons as it iterates through the array. Ultimately, it returns the smaller of the two sums, which is the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
nums = [-1, -2, -3]
print(minSubArraySum(nums))  # Output: -6
```
And here is the minimum necessary code to test the function:
```python
def test_minSubArraySum():
    # Example tests
    assert minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]) == 1
    assert minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3]) == -6
    assert minSubArraySum([0, 0, 0]) == 0
    assert minSubArraySum([3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4]) == 1
``` 
This test suite will adequately prove the function's correctness. 
To run these tests, you can copy and paste them into a Python environment or IDE. 

Let me know if you need help understanding any part of the code!
