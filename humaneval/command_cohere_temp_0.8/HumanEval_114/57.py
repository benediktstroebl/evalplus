```python
def minSubArraySum(nums):
    min_sum = nums[0]
    max_sum = nums[0]
    for n in nums[1:]:
        min_sum = min(n, min_sum + n)
        max_sum = max(n, max_sum + n)
    return min_sum + max_sum
```

The code uses an intuitive approach to track both the minimum and maximum sum possibilities as it iterates through the array. This guarantees that the minimum subarray sum will always be achievable, whether the subarray is made up of positive or negative integers. It is important to note that the original problem stated that the input array contained only integers, which the provided code assumes. Adapt the code if the list of inputs contains other data types like floats or strings. 

To ensure that the code handles all edge cases and conforms with the problem statement, it is vital to thoroughly test it with multiple input scenarios, including negative numbers, zeros, max int, and various mixtures of positive and negative numbers.
