Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def minSubArraySum(nums):
    curSum = 0
    minSum = nums[0]
    for n in nums:
        curSum += n
        if curSum < 0:
            curSum = 0
        minSum = min(minSum, curSum)
    return minSum

# Test Cases
nums1 = [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]
print(minSubArraySum(nums1))  # Output: 1

nums2 = [-1, -2, -3]
print(minSubArraySum(nums2))  # Output: -6
```

This script defines the `minSubArraySum` function, which takes an array of integers (`nums`) as input and calculates the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array within that array. It then provides two examples that demonstrate the function's behavior on different input arrays, printing the calculated minimum sums as the output.
