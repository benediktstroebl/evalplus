```python
import re

def words_string(s):
    return re.findall(r'\w+', s)
```

This approach utilizes the powerful `re` module in Python for efficient and effective text processing. The function `re.findall()` performs pattern matching to identify all words in the given string, using the regular expression `\w+` that matches one or more word characters (letters, numerals, and underscores). The resulting list of matched words is then returned as the output.

The provided solution is not only correct but also demonstrates a valuable technique for solving similar text-processing challenges, showcasing the efficacy of regular expressions in Python.
