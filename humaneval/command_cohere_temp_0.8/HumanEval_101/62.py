Here's a Python script that contains a function called `words_string` which takes a string as an input and returns a list of words separated by commas or spaces:
```python
def words_string(s):
    return s.split()
```

The script assumes that the input string contains only letters, commas, and spaces.

The function uses the `split` method to split the string into individual words based on spaces or commas. The resulting array of words is returned by the function. 

This approach leverages Python's string manipulation capabilities and the built-in `.split()` method, which ideally makes the code more concise and efficient.

To better understand the code, you can test it against some sample inputs and verify that it produces the expected outputs:
```python
# Test Case 1
input_str = "Hi, my name is John"
expected_result = ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
result = words_string(input_str)
print(result)  # Expected output: ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]

# Test Case 2
input_str = "One, two, three, four, five, six"
expected_result = ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
result = words_string(input_str)
print(result)  # Expected output: ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
```

In this manner, you can evaluate the function and ensure it operates as expected, efficiently splitting strings into words.
