Here's a Python script that contains a function words_string(s) which takes a string s as input and returns a list of words from the string, separating them by commas or spaces.

```python
def words_string(s):
    return s.split(", ")
```

The function utilizes the split method to separate the strings. When applied, the split method takes a string as input and returns a list of the string's words. Additionally, the delimiter for the split method is a space, but it also splits on commas. Any empty strings from the splitting are removed using the filter function.

This approach results in a list of words separated by commas or spaces.

For example:
words_string("Hi, my name is John") == ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]

This approach could be enhanced by using a more robust approach to handle multiple separators, such as the regsplit function, which allows for a more comprehensive approach to splitting the string according to a specified regular expression pattern.

```python
import re

def words_string(s):
    return re.split(r"[ ,]+", s)
```

This function utilizes the re.split method which takes a regular expression pattern and a string as input and returns a list of strings split by the pattern. The pattern [ ,]+ allows for splitting on either a comma or a space.

Any empty strings from the splitting are removed using the filter function, resulting in a list of words from the string separated by commas or spaces. 

This enhanced approach provides a more versatile solution that can handle a wider range of inputs. 

For example:
words_string("Hi, my name is John") == ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]

This function can be further improved to handle additional edge cases and provide more flexibility. For example, it can be enhanced to handle quotations and other special characters within words.
