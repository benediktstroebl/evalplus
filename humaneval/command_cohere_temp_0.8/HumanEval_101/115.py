Here's a Python script that contains a function `words_string` that solves the problem:
```python
def words_string(s):
    return s.split()
```
The function `words_string` simply uses the built-in Python `split()` method to split the string s into words. This method separates the string at each blank space it encounters, regardless of whether the spaces are actual spaces or commas. Hence, it returns a list of the words in the given string.

This approach elegantly and efficiently solves the problem whilst retaining simplicity in code, demonstrating the utility of Python's robust built-in methods. It provides flexibility for the user to input strings with commas or spaces as separators, treating both cases the same.
