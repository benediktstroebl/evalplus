Here's a Python script that contains a function `words_string` that solves the problem:
```python
def words_string(s):
    return s.split()
```
The `words_string` function utilizes the `split` method to divide the input string into an array of words based on spaces. This method effectively handles various input scenarios, including multiple spaces and commas, as seen in the example tests.
