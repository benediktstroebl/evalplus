Here's a Python script that contains a function `words_string` that solves the problem:
```python
def words_string(s):
    return s.split()
```
The `words_string` function utilizes the `split()` method, which, by default, uses a whitespace character (`' '`) to split the string into an array of words. Thus, the provided solution does exhibit optimization potential in terms of code length, while maintaining the same level of functionality, as it specifically caters to the problem's criteria.
