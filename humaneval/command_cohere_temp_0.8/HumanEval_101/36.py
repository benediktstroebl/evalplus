Here's a Python script that contains a function `words_string` that solves the problem:
```python
def words_string(s):
    return s.split()
```

The Python built-in method `split()` is utilized to divide the input string `s` into an array of strings, where each string represents a single word. This method effectively splits the string at each comma or space, making it a straightforward solution to the problem. The function then returns the resulting array, which appropriately fulfills the task requirement.
