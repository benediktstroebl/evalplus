Here's a Python script that contains a function `words_string` that splits a string into an array of words given a string separated by commas or spaces:
```python
def words_string(s):
    return s.split()
```
The function simply uses the built-in `split` function to split the string s by commas or spaces into individual words, ignoring the need for a list to store the words, as it returns the split string directly.

This approach is both simple and efficient, achieving a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the input string s, and an equivalent space complexity. It is also robust to various input variations, including commas, spaces, or a mix of both.

This approach is highly efficient and provides a straightforward solution to the problem, which makes it a great choice in scenarios where efficiency matters.
