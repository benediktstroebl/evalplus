Here's a Python script that contains a function `words_string` that solves the problem:
```python
def words_string(s):
    return s.split()
```
The `words_string` function utilizes the `split` method to divide the input string into separate words and subsequently return them as a list. This method serves as a robust solution for retrieving individual words from a given string. 

This script can be imported and executed within Python, and it can also be executed directly if it is saved in a file with a .py extension.
