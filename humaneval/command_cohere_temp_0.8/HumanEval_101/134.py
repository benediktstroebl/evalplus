Here's a Python script that contains a function `words_string` that solves the problem:
```python
def words_string(s):
    return s.split()
```

The Python built-in method `split()` efficiently divides the input string into list fragments. When dealing with punctuation or spaces, this method handles multiple delimiters gracefully. The function returns a list of words extracted from the given string.
