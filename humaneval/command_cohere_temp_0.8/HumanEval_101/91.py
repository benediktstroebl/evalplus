Here's a Python script that contains a function `words_string` that solves the problem:
```python
def words_string(s):
    return s.split()
```
The `words_string` function utilizes the `split()` method, which, by default, uses a comma and space to split the string into separate elements, returning them as an array. 

This straightforward solution achieves the task at hand effectively.
