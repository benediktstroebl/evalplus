Here's a Python script that contains a function `words_string` that solves the problem:
```python
def words_string(s):
    return s.split()
```

The Python built-in `split()` method is used in this method to divide the supplied string `s` into words based on commas or spaces. The method returns a list of words taken from the sentence.

Here is a simple test case to ensure the function behaves as intended:
```python
print(words_string("Hi, my name is John"))
# Expected Output: ['Hi', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'John']

print(words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six"))
# Expected Output: ['One', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six']
```

This function efficiently completes the task described in the problem statement. It provides an array of words from a given string separated by commas or spaces, irrespective of the positions of these separators.
