```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (q == q[::-1] and sum(q) <= w)
```

This function will return True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise. The object q will fly if it is balanced (it is a palindromic list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight w. The function uses a complex condition and boolean logic to return the appropriate response. 

#### Detailed Explanation: 
The given function will_it_fly(q, w) solves the problem as stated in the markdown code block. It takes two parameters, a list q and an integer w, and returns a boolean value, either True or False.

It uses a conditional statement to assess two conditions sequentially:
1. The tautology (q == q[::-1]) checks if the list q is a palindrome. This is achieved by comparing q with its reverse, denoted as q[::-1]. A list is a palindrome if its elements are the same when read forward and backward.

2. The inequality sum(q) <= w checks the second condition: the sum of the elements in q is less than or equal to the given maximum weight w.

If both conditions are met, the function returns True, indicating that the "object will fly". If either condition is not met, it returns False. 

This function encapsulates the logic of the problem through these conditions to determine whether the listed object can fly based on the provided parameters.
