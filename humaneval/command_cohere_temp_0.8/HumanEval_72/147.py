```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) == 1 or q == q[::-1]) and sum(q) <= w
```
The function will return True if the object q will be able to fly, and False otherwise. The object will be able to fly if it is balanced or has only one element, and the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight w. 
The balance condition is checked by seeing if the list is palindromic or if it has only one element, both of which are balanced states. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(will_it_fly([1, 2], 5))  # False
print(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1))  # False
print(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9))  # True
print(will_it_fly([3], 5))  # True
```
This should return the following output:
```
False
False
True
True
```
The given example tests your function with different scenarios and validates its correctness. The code is concise and clear in its approach, making it easy to understand and well-suited for problem-solving tasks like this one.
