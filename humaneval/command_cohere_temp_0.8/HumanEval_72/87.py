```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) > 1 and q == q[::-1]) and sum(q) <= w
```
The function `will_it_fly` uses two conditions to determine if an object will fly:
1. The object is a list of at least two elements (`len(q) > 1`) and is palindromic (`q == q[::-1]`). This ensures the object is balanced.
2. The sum of the object's elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight (`sum(q) <= w`). 

These conditions ensure that the object is balanced and light enough to fly under the specified weight limit. The function returns `True` if these conditions are met and `False` otherwise. 

This approach enables the function to efficiently determine if an object can fly based on its characteristics.
