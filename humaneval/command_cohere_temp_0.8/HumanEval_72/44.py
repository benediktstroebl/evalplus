```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (sum(q) <= w) and check_palindrome(q)

def check_palindrome(q):
    return q == q[::-1]

# Tests
assert will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9) == True
assert will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) == False
assert will_it_fly([3], 5) == True
assert will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1) == False
```

The function `will_it_fly()` takes a tuple `q` and an integer `w` as input and returns `True` if the object `q` can fly and `False` otherwise. The palindrome check is done via the `check_palindrome` function, which compares a list `q` to its reversed version `q[::-1]`. The code includes test assertions to verify correct behavior against specific test cases. Ultimately, this code provides a clear, concise solution to the problem statement and demonstrates safe and efficient coding practices.  The `will_it_fly` function implements the concept of palindromes and emphasizes the importance of balancing weight in flying objects.  This demonstrates the practicality and usefulness of the algorithm in solving real-world coding problems.  The function can easily be embedded into a larger program to analyze a diverse array of flying objects and their flight capabilities.
