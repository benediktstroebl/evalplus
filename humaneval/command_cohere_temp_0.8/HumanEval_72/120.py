```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (q == q[::-1] and sum(q) <= w)
```

This function will return True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise. The object q will fly if it is balanced (it is a palindromic list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight w. The function uses a conditional check to determine if the list is palindromic by comparing it to its reversed version and ensures the summed weight does not exceed the maximum possible weight. If all conditions are met, the function will return True, else it returns False. 

This approach assumes that the list `q` is a collection of items that will be carried, and the weight `w` is the maximum weight the carrier object can hold. 

To ensure that the function is well-tested, below is a test suite with a variety of inputs to validate its correctness:
```python
def test_will_it_fly():
    # Single element, any weight
    assert will_it_fly([3], 100)
    assert not will_it_fly([8], 3)

    # Longer list, weight can handle all elements
    assert will_it_fly([1, 2, 3], 10)
    assert not will_it_fly([1, 2, 3], 5)

    # Palindromic list, weight can handle elements
    assert will_it_fly([2, 2, 2], 5)
    assert not will_it_fly([2, 2, 2], 3)

    # Non-palindromic but sum under weight
    assert will_it_fly([1, 2, 3, 4], 5)
    assert not will_it_fly([1, 2, 3, 5], 5)

    # Highly unbalanced list, but under max weight
    assert will_it_fly([100, 100, 100], 200)
    assert not will_it_fly([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5)

test_will_it_fly()
```

The test suite covers various scenarios to ensure that the function `will_it_fly` behaves as expected. You can add more tests to cover additional cases or edge scenarios as needed.  This can help ensure that the code operates correctly and satisfies the problem statement.
