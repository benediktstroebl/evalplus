```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) == 1 or q == q[::-1]) and sum(q) <= w
```

The function `will_it_fly` utilizes two conditions to determine if a given list `q` will be able to fly:
1. The list `q` can have only one element or be a palindrome. The single-element case is considered balanced as it forms a valid palindrome with itself.
2. The sum of the elements in `q` should be less than or equal to the maximum weight `w` for the object to be able to fit in the plane. 

Here are examples where the function `will_it_fly` returns the correct values:
```python
will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) == False
will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1) == False
will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9) == True
will_it_fly([3], 5) == True
```
