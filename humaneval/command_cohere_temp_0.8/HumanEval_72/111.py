```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) == 1 or q == q[::-1]) and sum(q) <= w
```

The function `will_it_fly` uses two boolean conditions joined by the logical `and` operation to determine if the object `q` will fly. The base case is when the list is of length 1, which is always balanced and weighs 0. The recursive case mirrors the elements at the beginning and end of the list using the `[-1::-1]` slicing operation and checks if the reversed list matches the original list. This checks for balance. Lastly, the function checks if the sum of the list is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`. 

This problem can be solved using only Python's built-in features, making the answer strictly Python.
