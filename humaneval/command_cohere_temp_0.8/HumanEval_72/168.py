```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) > 1 and 
            sum(q) <= w and 
            q == q[::-1])
```

The function will return True if the object `q` will fly according to the given criteria, and False otherwise. This is achieved by returning True if `q` is a balanced palindromic list (`q == q[::-1]`), has an element sum less than or equal to `w` (`sum(q) <= w`), and has more than one element (`len(q) > 1`). If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns False. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9))  # Outputs: True
print(will_it_fly([1, 2], 5))  # Outputs: False
print(will_it_fly([3], 5))  # Outputs: True
```

This follows the specifications outlined in the example case description.
