```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (w >= sum(q)) and (w <= max(q)) and (q == q[::-1])
```

The function evaluates the conditions for flight with the given input parameters, returning True if the object will fly and False otherwise. It checks if the sum of the elements in the list `q` is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`, and if the list `q` is a palindrome. The given examples in the problem statement would return True, False, and True respectively when passed into the function. 

This function efficiently determines whether an object will fly under given conditions with a straightforward evaluation of the two conditions for flight. The conditions are checked in a logical sequence, ensuring that both are necessary for the function to return True.
