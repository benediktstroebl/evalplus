```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (q == q[::-1] and sum(q) <= w)
```

This function will return True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise. The object q will fly if it is balanced (it is a palindromic list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight w. The function uses a simple logical check to determine if the list is palindromic by comparing it to its reversed version and checks if the sum of the list elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight. If both conditions are met, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.  This approach ensures that the function leverages the inherent simplicity of Python to produce a concise and readable solution that fully adheres to the problem statement's guidelines.
