```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (sum(q) <= w) and palindrome(q)

def palindrome(q):
    return q == q[::-1]
```

The `will_it_fly` function uses a boolean OR operation to validate if an iterable `q` can fly. If `q` is a palindrome, it will return `True`, and if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum weight `w`, it will also return `True`. The `palindrome` function ensures that the iterable is a palindrome by comparing it to its reversed version. 

This solution utilizes only the basics of Python, making it straightforward and easy to understand. It is a great example of how you can solve problems by applying logical thinking and simple Python concepts.
