```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (sum(q) <= w) and (w >= max(q)) and all(q[i] == q[-(1 + i)%len(q)] for i in range(len(q) // 2))
```

The function relies on the properties of palindromic lists, which have equal elements at symmetric positions; for example, the list [1, 2, 3, 3] is a palindrome where the elements at indices 0 and 2 are both 3, and at index 1, are 2. Using this property, the function checks if the sum of the elements of the list is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w` and the maximum element in the list is less than or equal to `w` to determine if the list is palindromic. The function returns `True` if the list is balanced and the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is a simple test case to verify the functionality of the function:
```python
print(will_it_fly([1, 2], 5))  # Expected output: False
```

And here is a more exhaustive test case to ensure the function handles all edge cases and corner cases:
```python
print(will_it_fly([1], 1))  # Expected output: True
print(will_it_fly([1], 3))  # Expected output: False
print(will_it_fly([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 10))  # Expected output: False
print(will_it_fly([7, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1], 10))  # Expected output: True
``` 
This should return the following output:
```
True
False
False
True
```

This should give you a good range of tests, but it is important to ensure you have a good variety of tests to validate the functionality of the function. 

Overall, the code is concise and efficient, and it should serve as a good solution to the problem.
