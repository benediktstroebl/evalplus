```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (sum(q) <= w) and (w <= len(q) == len(set(q)))
    #alternative solution:
    # return (sum(q) <= w) and all(q.count(i) % 2 == 0 for i in set(q))
```
The function uses two conditionals combined with the logical operator "and" to evaluate if the object will fly. The first conditional checks if the sum of the object's elements (`q`) is less than or equal to the given weight (`w`). The second conditional checks if the length of the object is equal to the length of the set of its elements. Additionally, to make the solution more understandable, you could add an explanation comment above each conditional. 

The logic of the second conditional is based on the fact that if the object is a palindrome, then the order of its elements does not matter, and the set of elements in the object is symmetric. Thus, the number of occurrences of each element in the set must be an even number, otherwise, the object is not balanced. 

To test this function, you can call it with various inputs to verify if it returns the expected outputs given in the problem statement.
