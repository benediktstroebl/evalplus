```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (sum(q) <= w) and (w == q[0] + q[-1] == sum(q[1:-1]) or len(q) == 1)
```

The function checks if the sum of items in the list `q` is less than or equal to the given weight `w` of the object and if the object is balanced. The object is considered balanced if its weight is equal to the sum of its first and last items, or if the list has only one item. The function returns `True` if the object will fly and `False` otherwise. 

The markdown code block can be copied and pasted into a Jupyter Notebook or a Python script to test the function explicitly. 

**NOTE:** When copying and pasting code into a Jupyter Notebook, the code might initially appear in a code input cell. If you want to execute the code in a separate cell, you can convert the code input cell into a code cell by clicking the "kernel" icon at the top.
