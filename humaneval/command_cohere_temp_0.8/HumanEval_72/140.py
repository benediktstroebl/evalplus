```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (sum(q) <= w) and palindrome(q)

def palindrome(q):
    return q == q[::-1]
```

The `will_it_fly` function uses a boolean OR operation to determine if an object will fly or not. If the sum of the object's elements exceeds the maximum possible weight, it returns `False`, regardless of whether it is a palindrome or not. Likewise, if the object is not a palindrome, it will not fly, and the function returns `False`. The function returns `True` only when the object is both weight-balanced and a palindrome. 

The `palindrome` function determines whether a given object is a palindrome by comparing it to its reversed version. If the two are identical, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This separation of concerns makes the code more modular and easier to test and debug.  This approach also enhances code readability and maintainability while promoting a more resilient and adaptable codebase.
