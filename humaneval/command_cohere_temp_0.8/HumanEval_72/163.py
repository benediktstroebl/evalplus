```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (sum(q) <= w) and palindromic_list(q)

def palindromic_list(q):
    if len(q) == 1:
        return True
    else:
        if q[0] == q[-1]:
            return palindromic_list(q[1:-1])
        else:
            return False
```

The `will_it_fly` function uses a recursive approach to check if the list is palindromic. If the list has only one element, it is considered balanced. For longer lists, it checks if the first and last elements are equal and then recursively checks the inner elements. If the list is not palindromic, it returns False. 

The palindromic_list function incorporates the recursive approach, and the will_it_fly function uses it to determine flight eligibility. 

This approach ensures that the code is concise and easy to understand while effectively handling the palindromic nature of the list. 

However, note that this approach has a time complexity of O(2^n) due to the recursive palindromic check, which could make it less efficient for large lists. 

But given the constraints outlined in the prompt (maximum length 10 and maximum weight 5), this solution is sufficiently efficient and quick to compute.
