```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (q == q[::-1] and sum(q) <= w)
```

This function will correctly determine whether the given list `q` will fly under the specified weight `w`, based on the provided logic. It checks if the list is palindic (balanced) and if the sum of its elements weighs less than or equal to the maximum weight. The function returns 'True' if the conditions are met and 'False' otherwise.  The `palindic` attribute checks if the list is equal to its reverse, and the `sum` function calculates the total weight of the list. The `max_weight` parameter is the maximum weight that the container carrying the list can handle. 
You can include this code in your solution and customize it as needed. If you would like to test this function, you can create a Python file with the given question and expected output and use this script to provide the expected results.
