```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) == 1 or q == q[::-1]) and sum(q) <= w
```

The function `will_it_fly` utilizes two conditional checks to determine if the provided list `q` will be able to fly within the specified weight limit `w`.

The first condition checks if the length of the list `q` is equal to 1 or if it's equal to its reversed version (`q[::-1]`). This assesses if the list is balanced, effectively testing for palindromic characteristics.

The second condition evaluates if the sum of the elements in the list `q` is less than or equal to the specified weight limit `w`. This ensures that the total weight of the objects in the list does not exceed the maximum capacity. 

If both conditions are met, the function returns `True`, indicating that the object will be able to fly within the given constraints. If either condition is not satisfied, the function returns `False`, indicating that the object will not be able to fly.
