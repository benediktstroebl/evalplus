```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (q == q[::-1] and sum(q) <= w)
```

This function will return True if the list `q` is both palindic (when reversed, it is the same as the original list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the given maximum weight `w`. If either condition is not met, it returns False. This logic encompasses all the cases illustrated in the prompt, as well as passes the provided tests. 
For example:
```python
test_will_it_fly = {
    ([1, 2], 5): False,
    ([3, 2, 3], 1): False,
    ([3, 2, 3], 9): True,
    ([3], 5): True,
}

for case in test_will_it_fly:
    assert will_it_fly(*case[0]) == case[1]
```
