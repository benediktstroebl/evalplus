```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (sum(q) <= w) and palindrome(q)

def palindrome(q):
    return q == q[::-1]
```

The `will_it_fly` function uses a boolean OR operation to validate two conditions:
1. That the sum of the object's elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight (`sum(q) <= w`).
2. That the list is balanced (`palindrome(q)` returns True).

The `palindrome` function determines whether a list is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. It returns True if the two are equal and False otherwise. 

The script ensures that the function `will_it_fly` correctly determines whether an object can fly under the given conditions.
