```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) == 1 or q == q[::-1]) and sum(q) <= w
```

The function `will_it_fly` uses two clauses to determine whether the object `q` will fly or not. 

First, the function checks if the passed object `q` is a list with a length of 1 or is a palindrome. This checks whether the object is balanced. The use of the `len(q) == 1` condition assumes that a single value can be considered balanced. If the condition is true, the result of the function is true. Otherwise, it continues to the second clause. 

The next clause checks if the sum of the elements in the list `q` is less than or equal to the maximum weight possible `w`. If this condition is true, the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. 

Overall, the function returns True if the passed object is balanced and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight.

```python
# Example usage
will_it_fly([1, 2], 5)  # False
will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1)  # False
will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9)  # True
will_it_fly([3], 5)  # True
```

The usage examples passed to the function are designe to test the conditions covered in the function. Since the function covers all the conditions required for the problem the output of the function is as expected.
