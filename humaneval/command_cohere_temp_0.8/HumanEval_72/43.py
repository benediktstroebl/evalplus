```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (sum(q) <= w) and check_palindrome(q)

def check_palindrome(q):
    return q == q[::-1]

# Tests
q1 = [1, 2]
w1 = 5
print(will_it_fly(q1, w1)) # Should print False

q2 = [3, 2, 3]
w2 = 1
print(will_it_fly(q2, w2)) # Should print False

q3 = [3, 2, 3]
w3 = 9
print(will_it_fly(q3, w3)) # Should print True

q4 = [3]
w4 = 5
print(will_it_fly(q4, w4)) # Should print True
```

In this script, the `will_it_fly` function combines two conditions: first, that the sum of the elements in the list `q` is less than or equal to the maximum weight `w` (`sum(q) <= w`); and second, that the list `q` is a palindrome (`q == q[::-1]`). 

The `check_palindrome` function is provided as an auxiliary function to check if a given list `q` is a palindrome, returning True if it is, and False otherwise. This function is used in the `will_it_fly` function to verify that the given list `q` is a palindrome. 

The example tests correctly setup scenarios where the returned values of `will_it_fly` are correctly False, False, and True, respectively. 

This solution uses only the built-in features of Python, making it suitable for any Python runtime. If you would like to see a solution that uses the `re` module, let me know and I'll provide another solution that uses regular expressions for palindrome checking.
