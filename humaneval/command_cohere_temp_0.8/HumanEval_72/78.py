```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (sum(q) <= w) and check_palindrome(q) 

def check_palindrome(q):
    return q == q[::-1]
```

The `will_it_fly` function checks if the list `q` is a palindrome by calling the `check_palindrome` function, and it also checks if the sum of the list's elements is less than or equal to the maximum weight `w`. The function returns `True` if both conditions are met, and `False` otherwise. 

The `check_palindrome` function returns `True` if the list is a palindrome and `False` otherwise. It does this by comparing the list to its reverse (`q[::-1]`). If the two are equal, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This code efficiently solves the problem in a concise manner. Let's break down the code and its logic in detail:
1. **def will_it_fly(q, w):**:
 - This code defines a function called will_it_fly that takes two parameters: 
  - q: This is the object to be checked for flight capabilities. It is expected to be a list.
  - w: This is the maximum possible weight the object should have in order to still be able to fly.
 - The function returns True if the object q can fly, and False otherwise.
 - The object q will fly if it is both balanced (a palindrome) and if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight w.

2. **def check_palindrome(q):**:
 - This code defines a function called check_palindrome that takes one parameter: q. 
 - The function returns True if the list q is a palindrome, and False otherwise.
 - The function uses the slicing notation q[::-1] to create a reversed version of the list q.
 - It then returns True if q is equal to the reversed version of itself, and False otherwise. 

3. **return (sum(q) <= w) and check_palindrome(q):**
 - This is the conclusion of the will_it_fly function, which returns True if the conditions are met. 
 - The condition sum(q) <= w ensures that the sum of the elements in the list is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight.
 - The condition check_palindrome(q) ensures that the list is a palindrome. 
 - If both conditions are True, the function will return True, indicating that the object will be able to fly. 
 - If either condition is False, the function will return False, indicating that the object will not be able to fly. 

The code efficiently solves the problem by dividing the logic into two separate functions. The `will_it_fly` function performs the initial checks, while the `check_palindrome` function is responsible for determining if a list is a palindrome. This division enhances the code's readability and maintainability.
