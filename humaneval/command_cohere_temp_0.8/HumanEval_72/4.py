```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) == 1 or q == q[::-1]) and sum(q) <= w
```

The function `will_it_fly` uses two conditions to determine if an object will fly:
1. The object is considered balanced if it is a list with a length of 1 or if it is a palindrome. This checks if the order of elements can significantly differ from the start and end of the list. 
 2. The sum of the object's elements must be less than or equal to the maximum weight `w` to ensure the object is not too heavy. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9))  # Outputs True
print(will_it_fly([1, 2], 5))  # Outputs False
```

This will return `True` for a balanced and weighted list, and `False` otherwise.
