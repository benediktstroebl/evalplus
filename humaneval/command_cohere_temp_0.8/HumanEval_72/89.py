```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) == 1 or q == q[::-1]) and sum(q) <= w
```

The function `will_it_fly` uses two parameters: `q`, which is the list of objects, and `w`, the maximum possible weight of the object. 

The return value is `True` if the sum of the objects in the list is less than or equal to the maximum weight and the list is balanced, and `False` otherwise.

Here is an example of using the function with different inputs and the corresponding outputs:
```python
will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) # False
will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1) # False
will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9) # True
will_it_fly([3], 5) # True
``` 

This script will help you to efficiently determine if an object will fly based on the provided parameters. 

Is there anything else I can help you with?
