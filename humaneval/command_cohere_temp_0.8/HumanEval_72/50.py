```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (sum(q) <= w) and palindrome(q)

def palindrome(q):
    return q == q[::-1]
```

The `will_it_fly` function uses a boolean OR operation to validate if an iterable `q` can fly. If `q` is a palindrome, it will return `True`, but if the sum of the elements exceeds the maximum weight `w`, it returns `False`. 

The `palindrome` function ensures that the iterable is a palindrome by comparing it to its reversed version. If the two are identical, the function returns `True`, and `False` otherwise. 

This solution adheres to the problem's prompt, demonstrating an efficient and effective approach. Let me know if you'd like to refine the code or provide any additional problems!
