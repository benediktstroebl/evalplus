```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) == 1 or q == q[::-1]) and sum(q) <= w
```

The function `will_it_fly` uses two conditional checks to determine if the list `q` will be able to fly. The first condition checks if the length of the list `q` is only 1 or if the list is equal to its reversed version (`q[::-1]` creates a reversed copy of the list). This checks if the list is balanced. The second condition checks if the sum of the elements in the list is less than or equal to the maximum weight `w` that can be carried. If both conditions are met, the function returns True, if not, it returns False. 

This problem can be approached by thinking about the problem in terms of the two requirements and thus, 2 conditional statements; a list is balanced if it's a single-element list or if it's a palindrome, and a list is weighted correctly if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum weight. Thus, we can use the conditional statements `if` to combine the two conditions and return the appropriate response.
