```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) > 1 and q == q[::-1] and sum(q) <= w)
```

The function `will_it_fly` uses three conditional statements to ensure that the object `q` is a list that is balanced (`q` is a palindromic list) and its total weight is less than or equal to `w`. If all conditions are satisfied, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`. 

This approach gives a time complexity of `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the list `q` and a space complexity of `O(1)`.

The tests cases provided can be tested using Python's `unittest` module as follows:
```python
import unittest

def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) > 1 and q == q[::-1] and sum(q) <= w)

class TestWillItFly(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_will_it_fly(self):
        self.assertTrue(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9))
        self.assertTrue(will_it_fly([1], 9))
        self.assertFalse(will_it_fly([1, 2], 5))
        self.assertFalse(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1))
        self.assertFalse(will_it_fly([5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 10))
        self.assertTrue(will_it_fly([3], 5))

    def test_will_it_fly_with_empty_list(self):
        self.assertFalse(will_it_fly([], 9))

    def test_will_it_fly_with_single_element(self):
        self.assertTrue(will_it_fly([3], 10))
        self.assertFalse(will_it_fly([8], 7))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This will run the tests and indicate if any of them fail. 

You can always incorporate these tests into a continuous integration tool like Jenkins, CircleCI, or GitHub Actions to automate your testing pipeline.  If you'd like to do so, I can provide guidance based on your chosen platform. Simply let me know the specifics of your project or repository, and I'll assist you in setting up the integration.
