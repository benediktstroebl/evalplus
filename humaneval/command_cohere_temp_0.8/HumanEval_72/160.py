```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (q == q[::-1] and sum(q) <= w)
```

This function will return True if the list `q` is both palindic (using the slicing notation `q[::-1]`) and its sum is less than or equal to the maximum weight `w`. Otherwise, it will return False. This behavior matches the problem's statement. 

This function assumes that the list `q` may contain negative numbers, and the weight `w` may be any integer value. 

To ensure this function behaves as intended, it's essential to consider edge cases. For example: 
- Will it still work if `q` is empty? 
- What if `q` has repeated elements, or if it's not actually a list? 
- What if `w` is negative or exceeds the maximum int value? 

To address these and ensure the function is robust, additional tests could be added: 
```python
# Test cases
empty_list = []
list_with_duplicates = [1, 2, 2, 3]
not_a_list = 1
too_heavy = [1, 2, 3, 4]
q, w = not_a_list, 5

# Expected results
tests = [
    (empty_list, w, True),
    (list_with_duplicates, w, False),
    (too_heavy, w, False),
    (not_a_list, w, False)
]

for q, w, expected in tests:
    assert will_it_fly(q, w) == expected
```

This way, we can be sure that the function works as expected, even in unusual cases.
