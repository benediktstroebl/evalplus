```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (q == q[::-1] and sum(q) <= w)
```

This function will return True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise. The function checks if the list (or string) q is balanced (it is a palindrome) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight w. The function returns True if these conditions are both met, and False otherwise. 

Here is an example usage of the function for clarification:
```python
print(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9))  # This will print True
print(will_it_fly([1, 2], 5))  # This will print False
``` 

This should help solve the problem and pass the tests accurately. Let me know if you have any questions!
