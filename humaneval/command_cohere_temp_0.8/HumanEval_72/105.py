```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) == 1 or q == q[::-1]) and sum(q) <= w
```

The function `will_it_fly` uses two conditions to determine if an object will fly:
1. The object is balanced if it is a list with a length of 1 or if it is a palindrome. This is determined by checking if the length of the list is equal to 1, or if the list is equal to its reversed version.
2. The sum of the elements in the object is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight. 

These conditions ensure that the object is both balanced and lightweight enough to fly. 

The examples provided in the problem statement return the following results:
1. `will_it_fly([1, 2], 5)` returns `False` because the list is unbalanced.
2. `will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1)` returns `False` because the sum of the list's elements is greater than the maximum possible weight.
3. `will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9)` returns `True` because the list is balanced and the sum of its elements is less than the maximum possible weight. 
4. `will_it_fly([3], 5)` returns `True` because the list is balanced and the sum of its elements is less than the maximum possible weight.
