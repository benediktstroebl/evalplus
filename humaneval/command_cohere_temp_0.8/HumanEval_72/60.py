```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) == 1 or q == q[::-1]) and sum(q) <= w
```

The function will return True if the object will fly, and False otherwise. The condition len(q) == 1 or q == q[::-1] checks if the list is a palindrome, and q == q[::-1] will return True if the list is a palindrome, and False otherwise. Thus, if the list is not a palindrome and is of more than one element, it will not be considered balanced. The second condition ensures that the sum of the elements in the list does not exceed the maximum weight. 

Here is a test suite that can be used to test the functionality of the code:
```python
def test_will_it_fly():
    # Test cases:
    # True cases:
    assert will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9) == True
    assert will_it_fly([3], 5) == True
    assert will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) == False

    # False cases:
    assert will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1) == False
    assert will_it_fly([5, 4, 3], 5) == False
    assert will_it_fly([5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 10) == False

test_will_it_fly()
```

The test suite contains a variety of test cases to cover different scenarios and ensure the function behaves as expected. You can use this to further verify and confirm the correctness of the code.
