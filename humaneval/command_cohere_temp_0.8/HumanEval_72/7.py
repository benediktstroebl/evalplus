```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (sum(q) <= w) and (w % 2 == 0) and all(q[i] == q[~i%len(q)] for i in range(len(q)))
```

The function relies on the following reasoning:
1. A list `q` is considered balanced if its elements are the same when they are traversed in a forward direction and in a reverse direction (using the `~` operator in Python to reverse the index iteration).
2. A list `q` will contribute to the total weight of the object by `sum(q)`, so we ensure that this weight is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`.
3. For the object to be flyable, its weight must also be even, ensuring that it has a pair of balanced lists.

The function `will_it_fly` solves the problem by using these conditions to determine if the object will fly or not. 

This approach assumes that the list `q` represents the lists that make up the object. For example, if the object is a stick, the list `q` would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.  By iterating over the stick's layers, the function checks if the stick is balanced and if its total weight is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight. 

The function's complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the list q, as it iterates over the list once to check if it's palindic and performs a sum operation once to check for weight constraints. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you would like me to explain anything else about the code.
