```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) > 1 and 
            sum(q) <= w and 
            q == q[::-1])
```

The function `will_it_fly` uses three conditional checks to determine whether the given list `q` will be able to fly:
1. The length of the list `q` is greater than 1 to ensure it is not a single element or empty, preventing erroneous evaluations of single numbers or empty lists.
2. The sum of the elements in list `q` is less than or equal to the maximum weight `w`, ensuring the object will not exceed the weight capacity.
3. The list `q` is symmetric (palindrome), meaning it is balanced, crucial for maintaining balance to prevent uneven distributions. 

These conditions ensure that the function returns `True` only if the list `q` is balanced and its sum of elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`. 

The function returns `False` if any of the conditions are not met, indicating that the object will not be able to fly with the given parameters.
