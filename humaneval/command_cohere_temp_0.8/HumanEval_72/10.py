```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) > 1 and 
            sum(q) <= w and 
            q == q[::-1])
```

The function will return `True` if the object `q` will fly based on the given constraints. It checks if the sum of the elements in the list is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w` and if the list is balanced (i.e., palindromic). The additional condition `len(q) > 1` is added to ensure that the object is not a single element, as the problem statement mentions dealing with lists. 

This condition prevents the function from returning True for single elements that fulfill the weight and balance conditions. You can add further tests to the function to strengthen the validation of the inputs.
