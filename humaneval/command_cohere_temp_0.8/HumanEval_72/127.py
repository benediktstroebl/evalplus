```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) == 1 or q == q[::-1]) and sum(q) <= w
```
The function `will_it_fly` returns True if the object `q` will fly, and False otherwise. The object `q` will fly if it is balanced (i.e., it is a palindromic list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`. The function checks if the length of the list `q` is equal to 1 or if the list is equal to its reversed version (`q == q[::-1]`). If either of these conditions is True, the function returns True. If neither of these conditions is true, the function returns False. 
This problem can be solved in different ways, such as using `reversed()` and `sum()` functions to determine if a list is balanced and its sum is less than or equal to a given weight. 
Here is an example of how to call this function:
`will_it_fly([1, 2], 5)`  →  `False`
`will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1)`  →  `False`
`will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9)`  →  `True`
`will_it_fly([3], 5)`  →  `True`
