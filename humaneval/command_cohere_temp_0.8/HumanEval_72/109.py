```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (q == q[::-1] and sum(q) <= w)
```

This function will return True if the list `q` is both palindic (when you reverse it, it's the same as the original list) and its elements' sum is less than or equal to `w`, otherwise it returns False. This problem can be solved in different ways, this solution uses only the list's elements' sum and the length to determine the result, achieving linear time complexity.  The given examples in the prompt will return:
- `will_it_fly([1, 2], 5)` → `False`
- `will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1)` → `False`
- `will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9)` → `True`
- `will_it_fly([3], 5)` → `True`
