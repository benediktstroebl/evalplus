```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) == 1 or q == q[::-1]) and sum(q) <= w
```

The function `will_it_fly` uses two conditions to determine if an object will fly:
1. The object is balanced if it is a list with a length of 1 or if it is a palindrome. This is determined by checking if the length of the list is not greater than 1, and if the list is equal to its reversed version.
2. The sum of the elements in the object is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight. 

Example tests are included in the script to verify the functionality of the `will_it_fly` function. You can copy and run this code to see the results:
```python
test_will_it_fly = [
    ([1, 2], 5, False),
    ([3, 2, 3], 1, False),
    ([3, 2, 3], 9, True),
    ([3], 5, True),
    (['1', '2'], 5, False),
    ('abc', 5, False),
    (['a', 'a', 'a'], 10, True),
    ([1, 2, 1, 2], 7, True),
]

for q, w, expected in test_will_it_fly:
    assert will_it_fly(q, w) == expected
```
