```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) > 1 and 
            sum(q) <= w and 
            q == q[::-1])
```

The provided function uses the length of the list `q` as a basis for the first condition. If `q` is not one-sized, it returns `False` instantly, as both the conditions cannot be met. The sum of the list elements is then compared to the maximum weight `w` and returns `False` if the sum is more extensive, which fulfills the second condition. The list is checked for balancing using the condition `q == q[::-1]`, which returns `True` if the list is a palindrome and the function returns `True` if both conditions are fulfilled.
