```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) > 1 and sum(q) <= w and q == q[::-1])
```

The function `will_it_fly` uses three conditional checks to determine if the given list `q` will fly:
1. The length of the list `q` is greater than 1 to ensure it is not a single element or empty, ensuring it is a valid object for flight.
2. The sum of the elements in list `q` is less than or equal to the maximum weight `w`, ensuring that the weight of the object is within the acceptable limit.
3. The list `q` is symmetric (palindrome), meaning it is balanced, crucial for the object to maintain equilibrium while flying. 

Ultimately, the function returns `True` if the list `q` will fly under the given circumstances, and `False` otherwise. This approach enables the function to efficiently handle various scenarios and provide accurate results.
