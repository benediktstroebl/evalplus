```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) > 1 and 
            sum(q) <= w and 
            q == q[::-1])
```

The provided code defines a Python function called `will_it_fly` that takes two arguments: a container `q` and an integer `w`. This function evaluates whether the object `q` can fly under specified conditions:
1. The function returns `True` only if `q` is a non-empty container (i.e., `len(q) > 1`).
2. The total sum of the elements in the container `q` should be less than or equal to the given maximum weight `w`.
3. Lastly, the function checks if the container `q` is a palindrome, which is achieved by checking if it is equal to its reversed version `q[::-1]`.

In essence, the function determines if a container of items (`q`) can "fly" under specific circumstances, which include both a palindromic structure and a total weight within an allowable limit.
