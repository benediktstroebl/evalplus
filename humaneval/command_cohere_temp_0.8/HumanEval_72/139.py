```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (str(q) == str(q)[::-1]) and sum(q) <= w
```
The function `will_it_fly` uses Python's built-in str method to check if the list q is a palindrome. The expression `str(q) == str(q)[::-1]` transforms the list into a string, and the bitwise XOR `[::-1]` reverses the string, and then the two are compared. If they are equal, the list is balanced. 

The function returns True if the list is balanced and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight w. If any condition is not satisfied, it returns False. 

This approach ensures that the function returns the correct result based on the provided criteria and handles any edge cases that may arise. 
```python
def test_will_it_fly():
    # Empty list, should fly
    assert will_it_fly([],1) == True

    # Single element list, should fly
    assert will_it_fly([1],1) == True

    # Palindromic list with sum less than max weight, should fly
    assert will_it_fly([1, 2, 3],5) == True

    # Palindromic list with sum exceeding max weight, shouldn't fly
    assert will_it_fly([1, 2, 3],1) == False

    # Non-palindromic list with sum less than max weight, should fly
    assert will_it_fly([1, 2, 3, 4],10) == True

    # Non-palindromic list with sum exceeding max weight, shouldn't fly
    assert will_it_fly([1, 2, 3, 4],3) == False
``` 

The test code abuses the `assert` statements to check if the `will_it_fly` function behaves as expected on different inputs. 
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_will_it_fly()
```

The code splices the test function into the code block using the `if __name__ == '__main__':` method, which method ensures that the tests run only when the file is executed directly.  It forgoes the formal `runTests()` method in favor of concise one-liner `assert` statements. 
This approach provides an efficient way to validate the functionality of the `will_it_fly` function and ensures that it behaves as expected.
