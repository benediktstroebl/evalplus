```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (sum(q) <= w) and palindrome(q)

def palindrome(q):
    return q == q[::-1]
```

The `will_it_fly` function uses a boolean OR operation to determine if an object will fly or not. If the sum of the object's elements exceeds the maximum possible weight, it returns `False`, regardless of whether the list is balanced or not. Likewise, if the list is not a palindrome, it returns `False`, regardless of the sum of its elements. Only when both conditions are met—the sum of elements is less than the maximum weight and the list is a palindrome—will the function return `True`. 

The `palindrome` function, on the other hand, checks if a given list is equal to its reversed version. If it is, the function returns `True`, and `False` otherwise. 

This solution utilizes logical AND operation between two conditions, which allows for more flexible testing. By combining the conditions in this way, it covers all scenarios and provides a correct assessment of whether an object will fly or not, balancing the two constraints: sum of elements and weight, and the palindrome requirement.
