```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (q == q[::-1] and sum(q) <= w)
```

This function will return True if the list `q` is both balanced (i.e., a palindrome) and its sum of elements is less than or equal to the maximum weight `w`. Otherwise, it will return False. This logic follows the problem statement's guidelines and examples provided. 

Here is a sample output using the script:
```python
>> will_it_fly([1, 2], 5)
False
>> will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1)
False
>> will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9)
True
>> will_it_fly([3], 5)
True
```

This function is structured thoughtfully; however, it can be improved, both performance- and readability-wise, by taking advantage of Python's built-in `sum` function and list comprehension for an optimized and condensed solution.
