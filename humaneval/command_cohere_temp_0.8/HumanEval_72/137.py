```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) > 1 and 
            sum(q) <= w and 
            q == q[::-1])
```

The function will return True if the object `q` will fly according to the given criteria, and False otherwise. The criteria are that `q` must be a balanced (i.e., palindromic) list or array of integers, and the sum of the elements in `q` must be less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`. The function checks for these conditions and returns the appropriate boolean value accordingly.

This code should work for any valid input as it comprehensively considers the necessary conditions for the object to fly. 
However, let's break down the problem into steps for a more detailed insight:
1. **Length of q > 1**: This condition ensures that we are dealing with a list of at least two elements, eliminating the edge case of a single element or an empty list.
2. **Sum of q <= w**: The weight of the plane is denoted by `w`, and the total weight of items placed on the plane should not exceed this weight. The second condition checks that the sum of the elements in the list `q` is less than or equal to the maximum weight. This ensures the object doesn't become too heavy to fly.
3. **q == q[::-1]**: This condition checks if the list `q` is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forwards and backwards (ignoring elements' values, only the positions matter). If `q` is a palindrome, it's balanced, and thus, it will fly without tipping over. 

These conditions consider the balance and weight aspects of the object, ensuring the function returns the correct result for various inputs. For instance, the function will return `True` for valid inputs like `[3, 2, 3]` and `[1, 2, 3]` since they are balanced and have a sum less than or equal to the maximum weight. On the other hand, it will return `False` for invalid inputs like `[1, 2]` and `[3, 2, 3]` since they are unbalanced or have a sum greater than the maximum weight. 

The provided code is encapsulated and straightforward, solving the problem efficiently. It can handle various inputs while adhering to the given constraints of being a palindrome and having a weight less than the maximum allowable weight.
