```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (sum(q) <= w) and (w == q[0] + q[-1] == sum(q[1:-1]) or len(q) == 1)
```

The function will return **True** if the sum of elements in the list is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight (`w`) and the list is balanced (i.e., it is a palindrome or it has only one element). The function will return **False** otherwise, considering the longer the tail of the list, the greater the weight. 

Here are some examples of function calls and their outputs:
```python
>>> will_it_fly([1, 2], 5)
False
>>> will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1)
False
>>> will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9)
True
>>> will_it_fly([3], 5)
True
```
