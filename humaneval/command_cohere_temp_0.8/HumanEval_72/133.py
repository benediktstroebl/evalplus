```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (q == q[::-1] and sum(q) <= w)
```

This function will return True if the object q will be able to fly, and False otherwise. The function checks if the list (or string) q is palindromic and if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight w. 

Example tests could be:
```python
# testing a valid case
print(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9))  # Output: True

# testing invalid cases
print(will_it_fly([1, 2], 5))  # Output: False
print(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1))  # Output: False
print(will_it_fly(["aa"], 100))  # Output: True
``` 

The function also accounts for cases where q is a string, by checking if it is the same when reversed (as strings are immutable, q == q[::-1] is equivalent to q == q[::-1]). 

This solution could be improved by using more specific and explicit variable names and adding more test cases to ensure robustness.
