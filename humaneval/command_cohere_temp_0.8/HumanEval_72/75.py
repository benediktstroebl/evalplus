```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (q == q[::-1] and sum(q) <= w)
```

This function will return True if the list `q` is both palindic (using the slicing technique `q[::-1]` to reverse a list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the given maximum weight `w`. Otherwise, it will return False. This behavior matches the scenario's description of the "will it fly" concept. 

This solution enables the efficient and accurate determination of whether an object can fly, providing a clear and direct implementation of the given problem.
