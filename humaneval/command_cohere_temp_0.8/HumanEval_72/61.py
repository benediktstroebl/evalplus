```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (sum(q) <= w) and check_palindrome(q)

def check_palindrome(q):
    return q == q[::-1]

# Tests
my_list = [1, 2]
max_weight = 5
print(will_it_fly(my_list, max_weight))  # Should print False

my_list = [3, 2, 3]
max_weight = 1
print(will_it_fly(my_list, max_weight))  # Should print False

my_list = [3, 2, 3]
max_weight = 9
print(will_it_fly(my_list, max_weight))  # Should print True

my_list = [3]
max_weight = 5
print(will_it_fly(my_list, max_weight))  # Should print True
```

In the code above, the `will_it_fly` function accepts a list `q` and an integer `w` representing the maximum weight and returns `True` if the sum of the elements of the list is less than or equal to `w` and the list is a palindrome, and returns `False` otherwise. 

The `check_palindrome` function is used to check if a list is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.

The code includes a test section to validate the correctness of the `will_it_fly` function. You can run this code to see the results printed accordingly. You can modify the my_list and max_weight variables to test with different inputs.  If the printed result meets the expected outcome stated in the problem description, it confirms the functionality of the solution.
