```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (sum(q) <= w) and (w % 2 == 0) and all(q[i] == q[~i%len(q)] for i in range(len(q)))
```

The function relies on the following logic:
1. An object will float if its sum of elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight (`sum(q) <= w`).
2. It will float only if it is balanced, which is achieved if the weight is even and all elements in the list are identical (or symmetrically placed) (`w % 2 == 0` and `all(q[i] == q[~i%len(q)] for i in range(len(q)))`).

Feel free to test this function with different inputs to verify its behavior!
