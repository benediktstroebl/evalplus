```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) == 1 or q == q[::-1]) and sum(q) <= w
```

The function `will_it_fly` uses two clauses to return True or False. The first clause checks if the length of the queue `q` is one, or if it is the same as its reverse (`q == q[::-1]`). This checks if the queue is balanced. The second clause checks if the sum of the values in the queue is less than or equal to the maximum weight `w`. If both these are true, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False. 

This should address the problem you have outlined. Let me know if you need anything else!
