```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) > 1 and 
            sum(q) <= w and 
            q == q[::-1])
```

The provided code defines a Python function called `will_it_fly` that takes two arguments: a list `q` and an integer `w`. This function evaluates whether an object composed of the elements of list `q` can fly under certain conditions.

The conditions for an object to fly are:
1. **Length**: The object is longer than one element. This is ensured by checking that the length of the list `q` is greater than 1.
2. **Weight**: The sum of the elements in the object does not exceed the given weight `w`. This is checked by verifying that the sum of the elements in list `q` is less than or equal to the maximum weight `w`.
3. **Balancing**: The object is considered balanced if it is a palindrome, meaning that it is the same when read forward and backward. The list `q` is compared to its reversed version (`q[::-1]`) to determine if it is a palindrome. 

Overall, the function returns `True` if the object composed of the elements of `q` can fly under these conditions, and `False` otherwise.
