```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (sum(q) <= w) and palindrome(q)

def palindrome(q):
    return q == q[::-1]
```

The `will_it_fly` function uses a boolean OR operation to validate two conditions:
1. That the sum of the object's elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight (`sum(q) <= w`).
2. That the list is balanced through the palindrome function (`palindrome(q)`).

The `palindrome` function is an internal function that checks whether a list is a palindrome by comparing it to its reversed version. If the input list is a palindrome, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false. 

This approach improves the efficiency of the solution, reduces code complexity, and makes the code more readable and easier to understand.
