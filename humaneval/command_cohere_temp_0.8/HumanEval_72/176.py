```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) == 1 or q == q[::-1]) and sum(q) <= w
```

The function will return True if the object will fly, and False otherwise. The condition len(q) == 1 or q == q[::-1] checks if the list is a palindrome. The function checks if the sum of the elements in the list is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight. 

```python
# TEST CASES
q1 = [1, 2]
w1 = 5

q2 = [3, 2, 3]
w2 = 1

q3 = [3, 2, 3]
w3 = 9

q4 = [3]
w4 = 5

print(will_it_fly(q1, w1))  # False
print(will_it_fly(q2, w2))  # False
print(will_it_fly(q3, w3))  # True
print(will_it_fly(q4, w4))  # True
``` 
This code provides a correct and concise solution to the problem statement provided, fulfilling the conditions for the function's True and False outputs as stated in the example cases.
