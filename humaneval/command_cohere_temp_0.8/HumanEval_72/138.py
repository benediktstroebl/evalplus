```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) > 1 and 
            sum(q) <= w and 
            q == q[::-1])
```

The function will return True if the object q is a balanced palindrome and its sum of elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight w. Otherwise, it returns False. To test the function, call it with different input values to see its behavior on different scenarios. You can also test it against the examples given in the problem statement.
