```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) == 1 or q == q[::-1]) and sum(q) <= w
```

The function `will_it_fly` uses two parameters: `q`, which is the collection of objects to be loaded onto the aircraft, and `w`, the maximum weight of the cargo hold of the aircraft. If `q` is a palindrome or consists of only one element, it is balanced. The function returns `True` if the sum of the elements of `q` is less than or equal to the maximum weight `w`, otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Here is a simple test case to verify the functionality of the function:
```python
assert will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) == False
```

And here is a test case with values that should return True when passed into the function:
```python
assert will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1) == False
assert will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9) == True
assert will_it_fly([3], 5) == True
```
