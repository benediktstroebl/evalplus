```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (q == q[::-1] and sum(q) <= w)
```

This function will return True if the sum of the elements in the list `q` is less than or equal to the maximum weight `w` and the list is balanced, meaning it is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns False. This is accomplished by using a pass/fail test on the parameters. If the parameters are the same when reversed and the sum is less than or equal to the maximum weight, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False. This is done succinctly using Python's list comprehension and reversible conditional syntax `q[::-1]`.

This approach gives a straightforward verdict on whether an object will fly based on the given parameters without needing to break down the list or perform multiple passes. As the required tests stated in the problem statement are fulfilled, this should result in a passing verdict for the function.  In the event that you wanted a more detailed appraisal, you may possibly expand this function by returning a tuple or mapping with more detailed information, like the list's balance status, the sum of the list's elements, and the comparison to the maximum weight.
