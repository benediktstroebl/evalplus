```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) > 1 and sum(q) <= w and q == q[::-1])
```

The function `will_it_fly` uses three conditional checks to determine whether the given list `q` can "fly":
1. The length of the list `q` is greater than 1 to ensure it is not a single element or empty, as a single number or an empty list cannot be balanced.
2. The sum of the elements in list `q` is less than or equal to the maximum weight `w` to ensure the weight of the object is below or equal to the maximum possible weight.
3. The list `q` is symmetric (palindrome) to ensure the list is balanced.

The function returns `True` if all conditions are met, indicating the object will fly. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
