```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (q == q[::-1] and sum(q) <= w)
```

This function will return True if the list `q` is both palindic (i.e., identical to its reverse) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the given maximum weight `w`. Such a list is considered "balanced" and suitable for flight under the specified weight limits. If either condition is not met, the function will return False. 

Let's break down the logic behind this function: 

1. **Palindic Check**: To determine if a list is palindic, we simply compare it to its reverse. In Python, the slicing notation `[::-1]` is used to reverse a sequence, so `q == q[::-1]` checks if the original list is identical to its reverse.

2. **Weight Check**: The weight of the structure is determined by the sum of its elements, denoted as `sum(q)`. The condition `sum(q) <= w` checks if the weight of the structure is less than or equal to the maximum allowed weight `w`. 

Here's an example use case to demonstrate the function:
```python
print(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9))  # Output: True
```

In this example, the sum of the list elements (`3 + 2 + 3 = 8`) is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight (`9`), and the list is palindic (`[3, 2, 3] == [3, 2, 3][::-1] == [3, 2, 3]`), so the function returns True. 

The function will also return True for lists like `[3]` and `[1, 2]` since they are palindic and their sums are less than the maximum possible weight. 

However, lists like `[3, 2, 3]` with a sum exceeding the maximum weight or lists that are not palindic, such as `[1, 2, 3]` will result in the function returning False. 

The function is designed to be self-contained and does not rely on any external variables or additional functionality. It solves the given problem encapsulating both the balance and weight checks within the provided function.
