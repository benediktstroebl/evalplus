```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) > 1 and 
            sum(q) <= w and 
            q == q[::-1])
```

The function will return True if the object `q` will fly, and False otherwise. The object `q` will be considered flying if it is balanced (`q` is a palindromic list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`. The weight of the object is represented by `w` while `q` is the list of items. The function checks that the length of the list is greater than 1 to disregard single-item lists from being considered flying.

The logic of this function was devised by using the provided examples to determine the necessary conditions. These conditions were then translated into Python syntax and logic to form a function that fulfills the problem requirements.
