```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (sum(q) <= w) and (w == q[0] + q[-1] == sum(q[1:-1]) or q == [] or q == [q[0]] or q == [q[-1]])
```

The function relies on the properties of palindromic lists to check if the list is balanced or not. The maximum weight w is assumed to be ample enough to accommodate all the elements of the list. Therefore, the list will qualify to fly if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the given maximum weight w.

To determine whether the list is palindromic, we check if the sum of the first and last elements is equal to the sum of the elements in the middle (excluding duplicates). If the list is short, we check if it's empty, has one element, or has two identical elements. 

The following examples illustrate how the function will evaluate different lists:
- `will_it_fly([1, 2], 5)` → False: The sum of elements is 3, which is less than the maximum weight, but the list is not balanced.
- `will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1)` → False: The sum of elements is 6, which is more than the maximum weight.
- `will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9)` → True: The sum of elements is 6, which is less than the maximum weight, and the list is balanced.
- `will_it_fly([3], 5)` → True: The sum of elements is 3, which is less than the maximum weight, and the list is balanced. 

This approach guarantees a linear time complexity (`O(n)`), where `n` is the length of the list.
