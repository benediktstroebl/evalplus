```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) == 1 or q == q[::-1]) and sum(q) <= w
```

The function `will_it_fly` uses two boolean conditions joined by the logical `and` operation to determine if the object `q` will fly:
1. The length of the queue `q` is equal to 1 or `q` is an even-length palindrome, i.e., `q == q[::-1]`. This checks if the queue is balanced.
2. The sum of the elements in queue `q` is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`.

These conditions ensure that the queue is balanced and its weight is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight. The function returns `True` if the conditions are met and `False` otherwise.
