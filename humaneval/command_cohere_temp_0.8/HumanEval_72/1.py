```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) == 1 or q == q[::-1]) and sum(q) <= w
```

The function `will_it_fly` uses two conditions to determine if an object will fly:
1. The object is balanced if it is a list with a length of 1 or if it is a palindrome. This is checked using the condition `len(q) == 1 or q == q[::-1]`.
2. The sum of the object's elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight. This is checked using the condition `sum(q) <= w`. 

These conditions are combined with the logical 'and' operation (`and`) to determine if an object will fly. As stated in the comment, examples of objects that would and would not pass the test are also provided. 

This solution uses a straightforward `if` statement to evaluate the conditions and returns `True` if the object will fly, and `False` otherwise. This way, the function captures all the necessary constraints and provides a clear and interpretable solution.
