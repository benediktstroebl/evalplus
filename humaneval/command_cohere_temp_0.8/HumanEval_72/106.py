```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (sum(q) <= w) and palindrome(q)

def palindrome(q):
    return q == q[::-1]
```

The `will_it_fly()` function returns `True` if the sum of elements in the list `q` is less than or equal to the maximum weight `w` and the list is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The `palindrome()` function determines if a list is a palindrome by checking if it is equal to its reversed version. 

The function relies on two fundamental concepts: a palindrome check and calculating the sum of elements in a list. These concepts are foundational to Python, helping users accomplish various tasks. The code encompasses the problem's specifics and delivers a definitive solution. It's optimized for the given use case and efficiently achieves the desired functionality.
