```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (sum(q) <= w) and (w >= max(q)) and all(q[i] == q[-(1 + i)%len(q)] for i in range(len(q) // 2))
```

The function relies on the properties of palindromic lists, which have equal elements at symmetric positions; for example, the list [1, 2, 3, 3] is a palindrome, but [1, 2, 3, 4] is not. The function checks if the sum of elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight (w) and whether the list is balanced, i.e., a palindrome, finally returning True if the conditions are met and False otherwise. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(will_it_fly([1, 2], 5))  # False
print(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1))  # False
print(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9))  # True
print(will_it_fly([3], 5))  # True
``` 
The function will correctly return False for the first two examples and True for the last two.
