```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return (len(q) == 1 or q == q[::-1]) and sum(q) <= w
```

The function will return True if the object `q` will fly, and False otherwise. The object `q` will be considered flying if it is balanced (`palindromic` list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`. The absolute value of the list is checked using the condition `len(q) == 1 or q == q[::-1]`, returning True if the list is of odd length or is symmetric. The function also checks if the sum of the list elements exceeds the maximum weight with the condition `sum(q) <= w`. If all the conditions are met, the function returns True, and the object will be considered flying. 

This code can be used as a reference for future coding problems or exercises related to list balancing and weight capacity.
