```python
def unique_digits(x):
    odd = [int(''.join(c for c in str(i) if c % 2 != 0)) for i in x if int(''.join(c for c in str(i) if c % 2 != 0)) <= max(x)]
    return sorted(odd)
```

The function `unique_digits` takes a list of integers `x` as input and returns a list of all elements that do not have any even digits. The function first converts each element in the list to a string and checks if any digit in the string is odd. It does this by iterating over each character in the string and using the modulo operator `%` to check if the digit is not divisible by two, meaning that it's odd. It collects all the odd integers into the list `odd`. Then, it checks if the converted integer is less than or equal to the maximum integer in the input list `x` in order to avoid collecting larger odd integers that may have smaller even integers as prefixes. Finally, it sorts the list of odd integers in ascending order using the `sorted` function and returns the final result.

The test cases are not provided in the original problem statement, so they cannot be generated here. However, you can add test cases to verify the correctness of the solution. Here's an example:
```python
# Test the function unique_digits
def test_unique_digits():
    # Test case 1
    input_list = [15, 33, 1422, 1]
    expected_result = [1, 15, 33]
    result = unique_digits(input_list)
    assert result == expected_result
    
    # Test case 2
    input_list = [152, 323, 1422, 10]
    expected_result = []
    result = unique_digits(input_list)
    assert result == expected_result
    
    # Add more test cases as needed
    # ...

test_unique_digits()
```

This test suite will help ensure that the function `unique_digits` performs as expected with a variety of inputs.  It will also help to increase the test coverage to handle different scenarios.  Once the tests are completed, they demonstrate the validity of the solution, guaranteeing that the function accurately computes the desired outcome.
