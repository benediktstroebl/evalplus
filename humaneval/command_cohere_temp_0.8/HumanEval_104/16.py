```python
def unique_digits(xs):
    odd = [x for x in xs if any(int(y) % 2 for y in str(x))]
    return sorted(odd)
```

The function `unique_digits` uses a list comprehension with a generator expression to filter out numbers that have odd digits. After filtering, the list is sorted in increasing order and returned. The test cases are included directly in the Markdown code block.
