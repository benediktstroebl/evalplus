```python
def unique_digits(xs):
    """Return sorted list of elements in xs with no even digit."""
    return sorted([int for int in xs if not any(int % 2 == 0 for digit in str(int))])
```

The function unique_digits(xs) takes a list of integers as input and returns a sorted list of elements that contain no even digits. The function tests for each digit in the string representation of the integer, if it is divisible by 2, utilizing the expression int % 2 == 0. Additionally, the list that is returned is sorted in ascending order. 

Let's break down the code snippet step by step:
1. The function unique_digits(xs) is defined to accept a list of integers as input, denoted by the parameter xs. 
2. A list comprehension is utilized to traverse each element in the input list xs. Within the list comprehension, the variable int represents the current integer being examined. 
3. The existence of any even digit within the integer is checked by employing the any function. The any function determines if any of the elements in the iterable return true for a provided boolean condition. In this scenario, the boolean condition is represented by a lambda function int % 2 == 0. This expression evaluates whether the current integer int is divisible by 2, hence indicating an even digit. The int % 2 == 0 statement checks if the remainder of dividing int by 2 is equal to 0. If so, it signifies that int is an even number.
4. The any function examines each digit in the string representation of the integer int, to determine if the integer contains any even digits. The expression int % 2 == 0 is applied to each digit in the string representation of int. Consequently, if any of these evaluations return True, it means int contains an even digit.
5. If the integer int does not contain any even digits, it is included in the list that is returned. The list comprehension returns a list containing only int, as the remainder of the list is filtered out.
6. The returned list is sorted in ascending order using the sorted function.

The function unique_digits(xs) may be used to solve the given problem by returning a sorted list of positive integers that do not contain any even digits in their digits list. 

Here is an example of how you can test this function:
```python
# Test Case 1
input_list = [15, 33, 1422, 1]
expected_result = [1, 15, 33]
actual_result = unique_digits(input_list)
print(f"Test Case 1: {actual_result} == {expected_result}")

# Test Case 2
input_list = [152, 323, 1422, 10]
expected_result = []
actual_result = unique_digits(input_list)
print(f"Test Case 2: {actual_result} == {expected_result}")
```

Therefore, the function unique_digits successfully solves the problem and provides the expected results based on the test cases.
