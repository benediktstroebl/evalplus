```python
def unique_digits(xs):
    odd = [x for x in xs if any(int(y) % 2 for y in str(x))]
    return sorted(odd)
```
```
The function unique_digits(xs) takes a list of integers as input and returns a sorted list of elements that contain no even digits. It does so by using a list comprehension that filters out elements that have at least one odd digit (indicated by the expression int(y) % 2 for y in str(x) being True). The list comprehension uses the any function to short-circuit the evaluation and return False immediately if any element fails the condition.

The resulting list of odd digits is then sorted in increasing order using the sorted function, as required by the spec.
```

This solution is efficient since it uses list comprehension and short-circuit logic to filter out odd digits, allowing for minimal overhead and optimal performance.
