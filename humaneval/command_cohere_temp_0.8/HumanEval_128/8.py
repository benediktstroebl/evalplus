```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    result = None
    if arr:
        magnitudes = [abs(x) for x in arr]
        signs = [x > 0 and 1 or x < 0 and -1 or 0 for x in arr]
        result = sum(magnitudes) * prod(signs)
    return result
```
This function calculates the magnitudes of the integers in the array, then calculates the product of the signs of the integers in the array, and finally returns the sum of the magnitudes multiplied by the product of the signs. The `prod` function is used to calculate the product of an iterable (in this case, the list of signs).

Moreover, the function checks for the empty array case and returns `None` for an empty array. The function also provides examples in the docstring to help clarify its behavior. These examples show the function's expected behavior towards different inputs.
