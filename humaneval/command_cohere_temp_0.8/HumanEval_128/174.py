```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    result = None
    if arr:
        magnitudes = [abs(x) for x in arr]
        signs = [x > 0 and 1 or x < 0 and -1 or 0 for x in arr]
        result = sum(magnitudes) * prod(signs)
    return result
```
This function calculates the magnitudes of the integers in the array and the product of the signs and returns the sum of the magnitudes multiplied by the product of the signs. It returns None for an empty array.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4]) # -9
prod_signs([0, 1]) # 0
prod_signs([]) # None
``` 
This would return the following respective outputs:
```
-9
0
None
```
Which demonstrates the correct behavior of the function.
