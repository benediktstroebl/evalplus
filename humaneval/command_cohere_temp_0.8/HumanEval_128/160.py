```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    result = None
    if arr:
        magnitudes = [abs(x) for x in arr]
        signs = [x > 0 and 1 or x < 0 and -1 or 0 for x in arr]
        result = sum(magnitudes) * prod(signs)
    return result
```
This function calculates the magnitude of each number in the array using the `abs()` function and stores them in the `magnitudes` list. It then determines the signs of each number in the array and stores them in the `signs` list. Finally, it returns the sum of the magnitudes multiplied by the product of all signs, represented by 1, -1, or 0.

To test this function, you can call it with three example scenarios and compare the returned results with the expected outputs. You can use the `None` check to handle an empty array gracefully.

I hope this solves your problem. Let me know if you need anything else!
