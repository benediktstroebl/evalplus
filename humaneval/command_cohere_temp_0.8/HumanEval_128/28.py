```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    result = None
    if arr:
        magnitudes = [abs(x) for x in arr]
        signs = [x > 0 for x in arr]
        result = sum(magnitudes) * prod(signs)
    return result
```
This function calculates the magnitude of each number in the array using the `abs()` function and stores them in the `magnitudes` list. It then determines the sign of each number in the array and stores them in the `signs` list. Subsequently, it returns the sum of the magnitudes multiplied by the product of all signs, represented by 1, -1, or 0.

You can use the function by calling it and passing in an array as an argument. The function will then return the desired result as described in the problem statement.
