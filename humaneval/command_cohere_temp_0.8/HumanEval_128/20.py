```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    result = None
    if arr:
        magnitudes = [abs(x) for x in arr]
        signs = [x > 0 and 1 or x < 0 and -1 or 0 for x in arr]
        result = sum(magnitudes) * prod(signs)
    return result
```
This function calculates the magnitude of each number in the input array and determines its sign (1, -1, or 0). These values are then used to calculate the product of signs and the sum of magnitudes. Ultimately, the problem's prompt returns the result of these calculations. 

Here's how the function works in steps:

1. The function initially checks if the input array `arr` is empty through the `if arr:` conditional statement. If `arr` is empty, the function returns `None`, according to the function's specification for an empty input.
2. If the array is not empty, the function calculates the magnitude of each number in the `arr` through a list comprehension using the built-in `abs()` function. This is done to later use these values for the calculation of the sum of magnitudes.
3. Subsequently, the function determines the sign of each number in the `arr` through another list comprehension. It uses a conditional statement `x > 0 and 1 or x < 0 and -1 or 0` to determine if each number is positive, in which case it assigns `1`, negative, in which case it assigns `-1`, or zero, in which case it assigns `0`. This assigns the correct sign value to each element.
4. With the previous calculations, the function now proceeds to calculate the sum of magnitudes and the product of signs through the formula `sum(magnitudes) * prod(signs)`. This is because the `prod()` function in Python, based on its Python Docs, is capable of accepting a list of values and calculating their product, in this case, the product of signs. 
5. Finally, the function returns the result of the calculations, based on the problem's prompt. 

Note that this function is designed to work for arrays containing integers only, as the `abs()` function returns the absolute value of a number, which is suitable for this particular problem. If the input array contains values other than integers, the function may yield incorrect results. For empty arrays, the function returns `None`, as per the problem's statement.  This function can be embedded within a test harness to verify its correctness based on the provided test cases and others.  It can be used for larger arrays through its functionality to handle large calculations without time constraints.
