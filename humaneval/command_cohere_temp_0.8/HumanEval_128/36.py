```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    result = None
    if arr:
        result = sum(x * y for x, y in zip(arr, arr[1:]))
    return result
```
This function uses a list comprehension with a generator expression and the `zip` function to calculate the product of the magnitudes and signs of each number in the array. The result is then returned as the result of the function. This solution is succinct and elegant, effectively leveraging Python's powerful list comprehension and zip capabilities to compute the desired product of signs and magnitudes. 

To validate the functionality of the code, you can create a test suite with examples grounded in the problem statement.

Here is an example of creating a test suite:
```python
def test_prod_signs():
    # Example 1
    assert prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4]) == -9

    # Example 2
    assert prod_signs([0, 1]) == 0

    # Edge Case
    assert prod_signs([]) is None

    # Test with negative numbers
    assert prod_signs([-2, 2, -3, 3]) == -18

    # Test with a single element
    assert prod_signs([5]) == 5

    # Test with 0
    assert prod_signs([0, 0, 0]) == 0
```
This test suite covers various scenarios, including positive, negative, zero, and empty arrays, ensuring the function `prod_signs` behaves as expected.

When you execute this code, the tests will automatically run, and upon completion, you will see feedback on whether the tests passed or failed. This is a robust approach to validate your code, assuring its correctness and adaptability to diverse scenarios represented by the test cases.
