```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    result = None
    if arr:
        magnitudes = [abs(x) for x in arr]
        signs = [x > 0 and 1 or x < 0 and -1 or 0 for x in arr]
        result = sum(magnitudes) * prod(signs)
    return result
```
This function calculates the magnitude of each number in the array using the `abs()` function and stores them in the `magnitudes` list. It then determines the sign of each number in the array and stores them in the `signs` list. Subsequently, it returns the sum of the magnitudes multiplied by the product of all signs, appropriately handling the empty array case.

Here's the detailed explanation of the code:
1. **Function Definition**: The code starts with the definition of a function named `prod_signs` that takes a single argument `arr`. This function is designed to calculate the desired result based on the array of integers and return it. 
2. **Initialization of Result**: To initialize the variable result that stores the result of the signs and magnitudes of the passed array. The result will be None in the empty list case.
3. **Array Handling**: The code then checks if the input array arr is not empty using the condition `if arr:`. This is important because the function needs to handle the case where no input array is provided.
4. **Magnitude Calculation**: In this step, the code calculates the magnitude of each number in the array using the abs() function. This is a built-in Python function that returns the absolute value of a given number. The list of absolute values is stored in the magnitudes list.
5. **Sign Calculation**: Subsequently, the code determines the sign of each number in the array. The signs can be 1 (if the number is positive), -1 (if the number is negative), or 0 (if the number is 0). This information is stored in the signs list.
6. **Result Calculation**: The result is then calculated by multiplying the sum of the magnitudes in the magnitudes list by the product of all signs in the signs list. This is done to compute the desired outcome based on the problem statement.
7. **Return the Result**: The function returns the result variable, which represents the final output of the function.

This function incorporates the steps needed to solve the problem statement, and due to its structured nature, it's easy to understand and adaptable.
