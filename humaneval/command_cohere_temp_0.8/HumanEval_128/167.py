```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    result = None
    if arr:
        signs = [num > 0 for num in arr] * arr[0]
        magnitudes = [abs(num) for num in arr]
        result = sum(magnitudes) * product(signs)
    return result
```
This function calculates the product of all signs of each number in the array, represented by 1, -1, or 0, and the sum of the magnitudes of the integers in the array. The result is returned unless the array is empty, in which case None is returned. These results are then returned as the final outcome.
