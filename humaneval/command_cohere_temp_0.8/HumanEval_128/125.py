```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    result = None
    if arr:
        magnitudes = [abs(x) for x in arr]
        signs = [x > 0 and 1 or x < 0 and -1 or 0 for x in arr]
        result = sum(magnitudes) * prod(signs)
    return result
```
This function calculates the magnitudes of the integers in the array, then calculates the product of the signs of the integers in the array, and finally returns the sum of the magnitudes multiplied by the product of the signs. The None is returned for an empty array.

Here is a Markdown code block with inline comments explaining the different steps and checks present in the Python code:
```python
# Function to calculate the requested value regarding the signs and magnitudes of an array
def prod_signs(arr):
    # Initializing the result to None as a placeholder in case the array is empty
    result = None
    # If the array is not empty, we can proceed with calculating the result
    if arr:
        # Creating two lists to hold the magnitudes of each integer in the array and the signs (-1, 0, 1) of each integer
        magnitudes = [abs(x) for x in arr]
        signs = [x > 0 and 1 or x < 0 and -1 or 0 for x in arr]
        # Calculating the sum of magnitudes and multiplying it with the product of signs
        result = sum(magnitudes) * prod(signs)
    # Returning the calculated result or None if the input array is empty
    return result
```
This code block describes the logic of the prod_signs function so that it can be easily understood and provides comments on the individual steps and checks present in the function.  It should help you understand the solution fully. Let me know if I can help with anything else!
