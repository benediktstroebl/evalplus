```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    result = None
    if arr:
        signs = [1 if num > 0 else -1 if num < 0 else 0 for num in arr]
        result = sum([num * sign for num, sign in zip(arr, signs)])
    return result
```
This Python script defines a function named `prod_signs` that takes an array of integers as input. It calculates the product of the signs of all the integers in the array, where 1 represents a positive sign, -1 represents a negative sign, and 0 represents no sign. Then, it returns the sum of the magnitudes of the integers multiplied by their respective signs. However, if the input array is empty, it returns `None`.

The script includes a docstring at the beginning to provide a detailed description of the function's purpose, inputs, and expected outputs, along with example prompts that illustrate its behavior. This docstring helps users understand the purpose of the function and how to use it correctly.
