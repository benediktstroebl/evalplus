```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    result = None
    if arr:
        magnitudes = [abs(x) for x in arr]
        signs = [x > 0 and 1 or x < 0 and -1 or 0 for x in arr]
        result = sum(magnitudes) * prod(signs)
    return result
```
This function calculates the magnitudes of the integers in the input array and combines them with the product of all signs of the integers, returning the result as described in the prompt. If the input array is empty, it returns `None`. Feel free to test this code with different input arrays to verify its behavior.  This solution is straightforward and effective, earning efficient praises, yet if there is room for further improvement, it would be delightful to embrace alternative approaches.
