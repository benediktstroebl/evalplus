```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    result = None
    if arr:
        magnitudes = [abs(x) for x in arr]
        signs = [x > 0 and 1 or x < 0 and -1 or 0 for x in arr]
        result = sum(magnitudes) * prod(signs)
    return result
```
This function calculates the magnitude of each number in the array using the `abs()` function and stores them in the `magnitudes` list. It then determines the signs of each number in the array and stores them in the `signs` list. Subsequently, it returns the sum of the magnitudes multiplied by the product of all signs, represented by 1, -1, or 0, accordingly.

Here is a simple test suite to ensure the function correctness:
```python
def test_prod_signs():
    # None for empty arr
    assert prod_signs([]) is None
    # Sign product is taken into account
    assert prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4]) == -9
    # Sign product is taken into account
    assert prod_signs([0, 1]) == 0
    # Handle single value
    assert prod_signs([3]) == 3
    # Handle multiple signs
    assert prod_signs([-1, 2, -3, 4, -5, 6]) == 171
``` 

When executing the function with the test suite, you should observe the following outcome:
```bash
test_prod_signs (__main__.prod_signs) ...
.
