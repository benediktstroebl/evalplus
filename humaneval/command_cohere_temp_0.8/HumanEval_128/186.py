```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    result = None
    if arr:
        magnitudes = [abs(x) for x in arr]
        signs = [x > 0 and 1 or x < 0 and -1 or 0 for x in arr]
        result = sum(magnitudes) * prod(signs)
    return result
```
This function calculates the magnitudes of integers in the array and the product of their signs before returning the sum of the magnitudes multiplied by the product of all signs, ensuring proper handling of None for empty arrays.
