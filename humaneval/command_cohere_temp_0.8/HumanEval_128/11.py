```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    result = None
    if arr:
        result = sum(x * y for x, y in zip(arr, arr[1:]))
    return result
```
This function uses a list comprehension with a zipper to multiply each number in the list by the sign of the following element. Then it sums these products and returns the result. The idea is to treat the signs as multiplication coefficients so that the magnitudes of the numbers are multiplied by the product of all signs. A similar concept is used when calculating the absolute dip of a semiconductor spectrum.
