```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    result = None
    if arr:
        magnitudes = [abs(x) for x in arr]
        signs = [x > 0 for x in arr]
        result = sum(magnitudes) * prod(signs)
    return result
```
This function calculates the magnitudes of integers in the array using the `abs()` function and stores them in the `magnitudes` list. It then determines the signs of the integers and stores them in the `signs` list. Subsequently, it returns the sum of magnitudes multiplied by the product of all signs, represented by 1, -1, or 0.

The `prod_signs` function returns `None` for an empty array. You can verify this using the examples provided in the problem statement.

To run this code independently, save it in a `.py` file and execute it using the Python interpreter:
```bash
python prod_signs.py
``` 
This way, you avoid dependency issues and guarantee a standalone execution environment.
