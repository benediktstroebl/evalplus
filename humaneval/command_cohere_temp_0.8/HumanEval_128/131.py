```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    result = None
    if arr:
        result = sum(x * y for x, y in zip(arr, arr[1:]))
    return result
```
This function avoids unnecessary conditional checks by directly handling the case where `arr` is empty, and then proceeding to sum the product of adjacent elements in the list. This optimizes the solution and reduces the codebase.
