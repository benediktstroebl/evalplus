```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    result = None
    if arr:
        magnitudes = [abs(x) for x in arr]
        signs = [x > 0 and 1 or x < 0 and -1 or 0 for x in arr]
        result = sum(magnitudes) * prod(signs)
    return result
```
This function calculates the magnitudes of the integers in the array and the product of the signs and then multiplies them together. If the array is empty, it returns None.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 2, -4]
print(prod_signs(arr))  # -9

arr = [0, 1]
print(prod_signs(arr))  # 0

arr = []
print(prod_signs(arr))  # None
``` 
This would output:
```
-9
0
None
``` 
The function passes the given tests as the first example returns -9, the second returns 0, and the third returns None which is the expected output.
