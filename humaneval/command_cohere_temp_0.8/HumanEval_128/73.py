```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    result = None
    if arr:
        magnitudes = [abs(x) for x in arr]
        signs = [x > 0 and 1 or x < 0 and -1 or 0 for x in arr]
        result = sum(magnitudes) * prod(signs)
    return result
```
This function calculates the magnitudes of the integers in the input array and the product of the signs, and then returns the sum of the magnitudes multiplied by the product of the signs. If the input array is empty, it returns `None`.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 2, -4]
print(prod_signs(arr))  # -9

arr = [0, 1]
print(prod_signs(arr))  # 0

arr = []
print(prod_signs(arr))  # None
```
This would output:
```
-9
0
None
```

This Python script defines a function `prod_signs` that solves the problem as described in the markdown code block. The function performs the necessary calculations and returns the result, or `None` for an empty input array, as specified in the problem statement.
