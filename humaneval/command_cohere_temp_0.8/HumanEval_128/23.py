```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    result = None
    if arr:
        magnitudes = [abs(x) for x in arr]
        signs = [x > 0 and 1 or x < 0 and -1 or 0 for x in arr]
        result = sum(magnitudes) * prod(signs)
    return result
```
This function calculates the magnitude of each number in the array using the `abs()` function and stores them in the `magnitudes` list. It then determines the sign of each number in the array and stores them in the `signs` list. Subsequently, it returns the sum of the magnitudes multiplied by the product of all signs, represented by 1, -1, or 0, accordingly.

Here is a test suite to ensure the correctness of the implementation:
```python
def test_prod_signs():
    # None for empty arr
    assert prod_signs([]) is None
    # Sign and magnitude multiplication for single number
    assert prod_signs([5]) == 5
    # Multiple numbers, sign and magnitude multiplication
    assert prod_signs([1, 2, 3, -4, 5, -2]) == -135
    # All zeros
    assert prod_signs([0, 0, 0]) == 0
    # Mixed signs and magnitudes
    assert prod_signs([2, -2, 2, -2, 2, -2]) == -24
    # Single number with sign
    assert prod_signs([-11]) == -11
```
This would ensure that the `prod_signs` function behaves as expected. Feel free to modify the tests accordingly to validate different scenarios. Let me know if you would like me to explain any part of the code in more detail.
