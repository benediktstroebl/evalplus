```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    result = None
    if arr:
        signs = [1 if i > 0 else -1 if i < 0 else 0 for i in arr]
        result = sum([i * j for i, j in zip(arr, signs)])
    return result
```
This function simplifies the process by directly calculating the product of signs and the sum of magnitudes simultaneously through zipping and summing each pair. This eliminates the need for a separate count of positive integers. Furthermore, it checks for NULL input and returns None if the input is empty. 

Here's the inline test case that can verify the function:
```python
assert prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4]) == -9
assert prod_signs([0, 1]) == 0
assert prod_signs([]) == None
```
