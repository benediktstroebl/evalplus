```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    result = None
    if arr:
        magnitudes = [abs(x) for x in arr]
        signs = [x > 0 for x in arr]
        result = sum(magnitudes) * prod(signs)
    return result
```
This function calculates the magnitudes of integers in the array and product of all signs of each number in the array and returns their product. It returns None for an empty array.

Here is a breakdown of the code:
1. **Defining the Function**: The prod_signs function takes a list of integers, arr, as its argument and aims to calculate the sum of magnitudes of these integers multiplied by the product of all signs of each number in the array. This is done to make the sum more significant. The function returns None if the input array is empty, indicating that no calculations can be made. 
2. **Initializing the Result**: The function first sets the result variable to None. This variable will be used to store the final result of the calculations. 
3. **Checking for Non-Empty Array**: The function next checks if the input array arr is not empty. If it's empty, the result stays as None because no calculations can be made yet.
4. **Calculating Magnitudes and Signs**: If arr is not empty, the function calculates two things. First, it computes an array of magnitudes, where each element in this array is the absolute value of the corresponding number in the original array. Secondly, it calculates an array of signs, where each element is 1 if the corresponding number is positive, -1 if the corresponding number is negative, and 0 if the corresponding number is 0. 
5. **Computing the Final Result**: The function then combines these two arrays to compute the final result. It does this by adding up all the magnitudes in the magnitudes array and multiplying this sum by the product of all the values in the signs array. This final result is then returned as the output of the function. 

This function is designed to work correctly for various scenarios as explained in the provided example scenarios in the original problem statement.
