```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    result = None
    if arr:
        magnitudes = [abs(x) for x in arr]
        signs = [x > 0 and 1 or x < 0 and -1 or 0 for x in arr]
        result = sum(magnitudes) * prod(signs)
    return result
```
This function calculates the magnitudes of the integers in the input array and combines them with the product of all signs of each number, resulting in the desired output. If the input array is empty, it returns `None`.
