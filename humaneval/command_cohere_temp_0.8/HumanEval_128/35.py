```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    result = None
    if arr:
        magnitudes = [abs(x) for x in arr]
        signs = [x > 0 and 1 or x < 0 and -1 or 0 for x in arr]
        result = sum(magnitudes) * prod(signs)
    return result
```
This function calculates the magnitudes of the integers in the array and the product of the signs and returns the sum of the magnitudes multiplied by the product of the signs.

Here is a breakdown of the steps of the code:
1. The function prod_signs takes an array arr as input.
2. It initializes a variable result to None, which will hold the final result.
3. It checks if arr is not empty using the condition if arr:.
4. If it's not empty, it creates two lists, magnitudes and signs.
5. The magnitudes list contains the absolute values of each element in the input array, calculated by the list comprehension [abs(x) for x in arr].
6. The signs list contains the signs of each element in the input array, determined by the condition x > 0 and 1 or x < 0 and -1 or 0 for x in arr.
7. It calculates the sum of the magnitudes sum(magnitudes) and the product of the signs prod(signs).
8. Finally, it multiplies the sum of magnitudes by the product of signs and stores the result in result.
9. If the input array is empty, it leaves the result as None.

Note that this function assumes that the input array contains only integers. If the array contains other types of elements, you may need to modify the function to handle those cases. 

This code solves the problem using two arrays containing sums and signs, and then multiplying them to get the final result.
