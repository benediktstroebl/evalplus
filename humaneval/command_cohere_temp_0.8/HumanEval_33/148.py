```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    l_copy = l.copy()
    sorted_third = [e for e in l if e%3 == 0]
    sorted_third.sort()
    for e in sorted_third:
        l_copy[e%3] = e
    return l_copy
```

The script uses a copy of the original list to avoid changing the original list in case the indicies being modified are also in the original list. The list `sorted_third` stores the values from the original list which are divisible by three. Then, using a for loop this list is used to replace the corresponding values in the copy of the original list. The resulting list is then returned. 

Here's a test suite that can be used to validate the functionality of the function:
```python
def test_sort_third():
    assert sort_third([1, 2, 3]) == [1, 2, 3]
    assert sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]) == [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    assert sort_third([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) == [0, 3, 6, 1, 4, 7, 2, 5, 8, 9]
    assert sort_third([10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) == [10, 6, 3, 4, 7, 2, 5, 8, 9, 1]
