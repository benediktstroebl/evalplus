```python
def sort_third(l):
    return l[:] == sorted(l)[:] for _ in range(2) if l and all(not i%3 for i in range(len(l))) else l
```
This script defines a function called `sort_third` which takes a list `l` as an input. The function uses a short circuiting logic to check and verify that the list is not empty and all the indices of the list are divisible by three. If the condition is fulfilled, it confirms that the resultant list after sorting is identical to the original list, by using the `==` operator which checks reference equality, and the `:` slice is used to avoid any modification of the original list `l`. The desired result is achieved after two iterations. If the condition is not fulfilled, the original list `l` is returned. 

This code uses a clever use of short-circuiting logic and list comprehension to solve the problem in a very efficient manner.
