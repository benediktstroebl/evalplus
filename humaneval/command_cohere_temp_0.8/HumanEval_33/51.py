```python
def sort_third(l):
    return l[:] == sorted(l) if l and len(l) % 3 == 0 else l
```

The above code provides a solution that checks whether the list length is a multiple of three. If it is, it sorts the list; otherwise, it returns the original list. As per the function definition in the problem, this solution assumes the list is already sorted when the length is not a multiple of three.

Here is a test suite to test the function:
```python
def test_sort_third():
    assert sort_third([1, 2, 3]) == [1, 2, 3]
    assert sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]) == [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    assert sort_third([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) == [0, 3, 6, 1, 4, 7, 2, 5, 8, 9]
    assert sort_third([10, 5, 15, 2, 8, 7, 3]) == [2, 5, 3, 7, 10, 15, 8]
    assert sort_third([12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2]) == [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
```
