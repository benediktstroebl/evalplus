```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    l_sorted = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3 != 0]
    l_sorted += [sorted(y for y in l if i % 3 == 0)]
    return l_sorted
```

This script defines a function `sort_third` which takes a list `l` as an argument and returns a new list `l_sorted` such that `l_sorted` is identical to `l` at indices that are not divisible by three, while the values at indices that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indices of `l`, but sorted. 

Here is an example:
```python
>>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
[1, 2, 3]
>>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```

This example shows the correct output for the function based on the test cases provided in the original problem description.
