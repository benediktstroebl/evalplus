```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    l_copy = l.copy()
    return [element for ind, element in enumerate(l) if ind % 3 != 0 or element < l_copy[ind] or l_copy[ind] == element] \
           + [element for ind, element in enumerate(sorted(l)) if ind % 3 == 0 and l_copy[ind] != element]
```
The problem is solved by creating a copy of the list (`l_copy`) and using two list comprehensions. The first comprehension sets elements at 
indices that are not divisible by three to their original values in the copy if they are equal in the original list, or if the 
original list has the element at that index but not the copy, or if the copy has the element but not the original list. 
The second comprehension sets the elements at indices that are divisible by three to the sorted values in the original 
list, but only for elements that have different values in the original and copy lists. This ensures that the original 
list is not modified and that the desired output is achieved. 

Here is an example of how you can test this function:
```python
test_list = [1, 2, 3]
expected_result = [1, 2, 3]
result = sort_third(test_list)
assert result == expected_result
```
This verifies that the function sorts the list in the required way.
