```python
def sort_third(l):
    return l[:] if not isinstance(l, list) else [y for i, y in enumerate(l) if i % 3 != 0] + [sorted(x for x in l if i % 3 == 0)]
```

This Python script defines a function called `sort_third` that takes a list (`l`) as input. This function returns a list `l'` that maintains the original elements at indices not divisible by three (`l'[i] == l[i] for i not divisible by 3`) while the elements at indices divisible by three are sorted (`l'[i] == sorted(l[i]) for i divisible by 3`). The expected behavior is that `sort_third([1, 2, 3])` returns `[1, 2, 3]` and `sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])` returns `[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]`. The function uses list comprehension and indexing techniques to filter out and sort specific elements while maintaining the original list's structure.
