```python
def sort_third(l):
    l3 = [e for e in l if e%3==0]
    l3.sort()
    return l[:len(l)//3*3]+l3+l[len(l)//3*3:]
```
This code defines a function sort_third, which takes a list l as input and returns a sorted version of the list for indices that are divisible by three, while leaving the other indices unchanged. The function utilizes list comprehension to create a new list, l3, which includes elements from the original list l that correspond to indices divisible by three. The elements in l3 are then sorted in ascending order using the sort() method. Finally, the function concatenates the sorted elements from l3 onto the original list l, using slicing to exclude only the elements corresponding to divisible-by-three indices. The output of this code is a list l' where elements at divisible-by-three indices are sorted, while elements at other indices remain unchanged from the original list l.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # Output: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```
Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:
- The line l3 = [e for e in l if e%3==0] creates the l3 list using a list comprehension. It iterates through each element e in the input list l and checks if the modulus of e divided by 3 is equal to 0. If the condition is true, meaning the index is divisible by three, e is included in the l3 list.
- The line l3.sort() sorts the elements in the l3 list in ascending order.
- The return statement returns a sliced version of the original list l, divided into three parts. The first part, [l[0:len(l)//3*3]], includes the elements of l up to the indices divisible by three. The second part, l3, includes the sorted elements corresponding to indices divisible by three. The last part, l[len(l)//3*3:], includes the remaining elements from l after the sorted elements.

In essence, the code manipulates the list to sort only the elements at indices that are divisible by three, while leaving the other elements unchanged, and then returns the modified list.
