```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    l_copy = l.copy()
    return l_copy[:] [:: (len(l) + 1) % 3 != 0] + l_copy[:] [:: (len(l) + 1) % 3 == 0]
```

The problem asks us to create a "sorting lens" - a view of the list where every third element is sorted in ascending order, while every other element is left as it was.

One way to do this is to create a new list with the elements every third element of the original list, sorted in ascending order. Then, we can overwrite the original list with this new list. Every other element of the list would remain identical to the original list, while every third element would be sorted.

This is the approach implemented in the above solution. To create the sorted every-third-element list, we use concatenation and slicing: ``l_copy[:] [:: (len(l) + 1) % 3 != 0] + l_copy[:] [:: (len(l) + 1) % 3 == 0]`. The ``copy()`` method is used to create a new list with the same elements without modifying the original list. We slice the new list using a complex expression that behaves as an index: it returns ``True`` for every third element, and ``False`` for every second element, triggering the concatenation of the two lists.
