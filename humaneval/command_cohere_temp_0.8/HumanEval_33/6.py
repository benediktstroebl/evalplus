```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    l_new = []
    for i in range(0, len(l), 3):
        try:
            temp = l[i:i+3]
            temp.sort()
            l_new.extend(temp)
        except:
            # In the case that we end the loop with a leftover that is less than three elements, append it to the list.
            l_new.extend(l[i:i+3])
    return l_new
```

This algorithm utilizes a list comprehension to iterate through the list in chunks of three, which makes it inefficient for large lists, since list comprehensions in Python are not optimized for large datasets. Additionally, the try-except block is necessary to handle the case where the iteration does not end on a list delimiter. 

To efficiently solve this problem, you can utilize the already existing sort method in python, combined with the slice notation, to sort every third element. Below is an example of how you can do this:
```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if not (len(l)%3 == i%3) or x < l[i] for i in range(len(l))]
```

This works because the condition for the list comprehension redirects the flow of iteration to include an element x if either (1) the list is not divisible by three or (2) the element x is less than the corresponding element in the original list. The result is a sorted list of integers, where every third element is sorted in ascending order.
