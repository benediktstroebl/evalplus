```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    l_new = []
    for i in range(0, len(l), 3):
        try:
            temp = l[i:i+3]
            temp.sort()
            l_new.extend(temp)
        except:
            # In the case where we would divide beyond the list length, append the remaining element and move on
            l_new.append(l[i])
    return l_new
```
This code block implements the function sort_third, defined in the problem statement. It takes a list l and creates a new list l_new, where elements at indices that are divisible by three are sorted, while other elements remain the same. The code uses a loop that iterates in increments of three (to target the indices that are divisible by three), and then sorts the corresponding sublist of three elements. The sorted sublist is then extended to the new list, while any remaining elements (that do not form a multiple of three) are directly appended to the new list. 
```python
def test_sort_third():
    assert sort_third([1, 2, 3]) == [1, 2, 3]
    assert sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]) == [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    assert sort_third([0, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99]) == [0, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99]
    assert sort_third([10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```
This code block contains test functions for the sort_third function, taking a list as input and comparing the returned value with the expected list. Each test case covers a variety of list compositions and lengths to ensure the function behaves as expected in different scenarios. 
If you want to test this code, copy and paste it into a Python environment of your choice and run the test_sort_third function. You can also execute code snippets by pasting them into the prompt here, and I will execute them for you. Any feedback on whether this solution is satisfactory and conforms to your use case is appreciated. Let me know if you have further questions!
