```python
def sort_third(l):
    return l[:] if not l or len(l) % 3 else sorted(l[i] for i in range(0, len(l), 3))
```

The problem asks for a list that is identical to the input list in all indices that are not divisible by three, while the values at the indices that are divisible by three are sorted. If the list is empty or has no indices that are divisible by three, we simply return the unchanged input list `l[:]`. Otherwise, we sort the values at the indices that are divisible by three by creating a list comprehension that iterates in steps of three, sorting each chunk.
