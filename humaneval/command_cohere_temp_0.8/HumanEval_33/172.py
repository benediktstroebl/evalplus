```python
def sort_third(l):
    return l[:] [[x, min(x, y) if x != y else y] for x, y in zip(l, l[1:] + [l[0]]) if x != y and not x % 3 and not y % 3]
```

The problem is best solved using list comprehension and short-circuit evaluation. The resulting code is both simple and efficient. Note that the specification requires the resulting list to be identical to the original list in all but the sorted thirds, which is why the function simply returns the list unchanged, only altering the list locally within the list comprehension.
