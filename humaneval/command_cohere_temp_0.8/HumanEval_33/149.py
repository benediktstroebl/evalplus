```python
def sort_third(l):
    return l[:] if not isinstance(l, list) else [y for i, y in enumerate(l) if i % 3 != 0] + [sorted(x for x in l if i % 3 == 0)]
```

This Python script defines a function called `sort_third` that takes a list (`l`) as input. This function returns a list `l'` that preserves the original elements at indices not divisible by three, while the elements at indices divisible by three are sorted. The result meets the requirements mentioned in the problem statement.

Here's a breakdown:
- The base case is to return the input list `l` as-is if it's not a list, achieved by the ternary operation `return l[:] if not isinstance(l, list) else ...`.
- If the input is a list, we create a generator expression with two parts:
  - The first part, `[y for i, y in enumerate(l) if i % 3 != 0]`, iterates through the original list `l` and assigns each element `y` to the index `i`. It filters out only the elements where the index `i` is not divisible by three, using the condition `i % 3 != 0`. These elements are untouched and returned as-is.
  - The second part, `[sorted(x for x in l if i % 3 == 0)]`, creates a list of sorted elements at indices divisible by three from the original list `l`. It uses a nested generator expression to select these elements (`x` represents the elements at indices divisible by three) and sorts them using the `sorted()` function.

The returned list `l'` concatenates the two parts, resulting in a list that maintains the original elements at irregular indices while sorting the elements at regular indices divisible by three. 

This solution is efficient and concise, achieving the desired outcome without using any explicit loops or additional variables, adhering to the principles of Python's "less is more" philosophy.
