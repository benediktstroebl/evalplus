```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    l_copy = l.copy()
    sorted_l = []
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            sorted_l.append(sorted(l_copy[i]))
        else:
            sorted_l.append(l_copy[i])
    return sorted_l
```

This Python script defines a function called `sort_third`. This function takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list `l_copy`. The new list is identical to the input list in indices that are not divisible by three, while in the remaining cases, the list is sorted. This behavior is implemented via the following logic:
1. First, the function creates a copy of the input list, `l_copy`, using the `.copy()` method. This ensures that modifications to `l_copy` do not affect the original input list `l`. 
2. Then, the function creates an empty list `sorted_l` to store the sorted values at indices that are divisible by three.
3. Next, the function uses a `for` loop to iterate through each index of the input list `l`. 
 4. Inside the loop, a conditional statement is used to check whether the index is divisible by three, i.e., `i % 3 == 0`  If the index is divisible by three, the function uses the Python `sorted()` function to create a sorted copy of the corresponding element in `l_copy` and append this to `sorted_l`. Note that the `.copy()` method is used to ensure that the original list remains unchanged. 
 5. If the index is not divisible by three, the function appends the current element in `l_copy` to `sorted_l`.

Finally, the function returns the `sorted_l` list, which is the output of the `sort_third` function. 

The function is tested twice, firstly with the list `[1, 2, 3]` and secondly with the list `[5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]`. It returns the expected output `[1, 2, 3]` and `[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]` respectively.
