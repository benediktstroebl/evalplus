```python
def sort_third(l):
    return l[:] if not isinstance(l, list) else [y for i, y in enumerate(l) if i % 3 != 0] + [sorted(x for x in l if i % 3 == 0)]
```

This Python script defines a function called `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as an input. This function returns a list `l'` that maintains the original elements at indices that are not divisible by three, while the elements at indices that are divisible by three are sorted in ascending order. The script incorporates a concise list comprehension for indexing and sorting, enhancing readability and efficiency. The function operates by checking if the index is divisible by three, then sorting the element at that index, and finally returning the modified list.
