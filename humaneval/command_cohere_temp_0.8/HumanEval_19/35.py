```python
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    numbers = [int(char) for char in numbers.split()]
    numbers.sort()
    return ' '.join(map(str, numbers))
```
This Python script defines a function called `sort_numbers` which takes a string containing a sequence of numbers and sorts it in ascending order. The function splits the input string into individual numbers, converts them to integers, sorts the list of integers, and then joins the sorted numbers back into a string. This process ensures that the sequence of numbers is sorted, and the function returns the sorted string. 
The script encapsulates this behavior within a function, making it reusable and modular. By passing different input strings to the function, you can sort and rearrange numerical sequences as needed, thereby facilitating easy number sorting in a concise and intuitive manner. Fuzz Testing:
To test the robustness of the `sort_numbers` function against edge cases and invalid inputs, you could employ fuzz testing. This involves providing the function with various random or purposefully corrupted inputs and verifying that it handles these cases gracefully without crashing or producing unexpected results. Here's an example of incorporating fuzz testing using the `unittest.mock` module:
```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import Mock, call

def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    return ' '.join(sorted(numbers.split()))

class FuzzTesting(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_sort_numbers_fuzz(self):
        # Generate a list of random inputs
        random_inputs = [
            '123',  # Straightforward input
            '89abc',  # Non-numeric characters present
            '07',    # Starts with 0
            'ninja', # Non-numeric characters throughout
            '1',     # Single digit
            '999999999999999999999999',   # Long sequence of digits
        ]

        # Mock the sorted function to avoid actual sorting (efficiency optimization)
        with unittest.mock.patch('builtins.sorted') as mock_sorted:
            # Expect the sort_numbers function to be called with the random inputs
            mock_sorted.side_effect = lambda x: x
            for input_ in random_inputs:
                sort_numbers(input_)  # Call the function with the random input

    def test_sort_numbers_validates_input(self):
        # Test case to ensure the function raises a ValueError for invalid input
        self.assertRaises(ValueError, sort_numbers, 'abc')
```
Fuzz testing is a technique that involves feeding random or varied inputs to a function to expose potential flaws or unexpected behavior. In the provided example, a list of random inputs is generated to test how the `sort_numbers` function responds to different scenarios, including invalid input. 

The `unittest.mock` module is used to patch the `sorted` function, preventing it from actually sorting the data, and the `side_effect` is utilized to ensure the original input is returned. This allows the focus to remain on testing the function's behavior, regardless of whether the sorting operation succeeds. 

Furthermore, the test case `test_sort_numbers_validates_input` ensures the function raises a `ValueError` for invalid input, reinforcing the requirement that the input should only contain numeric characters. 

By integrating fuzz testing into the test suite, the `sort_numbers` function's robustness is comprehensively assessed, helping to uncover potential issues and guarantee more dependable code.
