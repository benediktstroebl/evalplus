```python
def sort_numbers(input_string: str) -> str:
    """
    Sorts a space-delimited string of numbers from smallest to largest.
    Valid inputs are 'zero' to 'nine'.
    """
    numbers = input_string.split()
    sorted_numbers = ' '.join(sorted(numbers))
    return sorted_numbers
```

This script takes an input string, splits it into a list of numbers, sorts that list, and then joins the numbers back into a string. This ensures that the numbers are sorted correctly from smallest to largest. 

Let's break down the code step by step:
1. **Function Signature**: 
   ```python
   def sort_numbers(input_string: str) -> str:
   ```
   This line defines a new function named `sort_numbers` that takes a single argument called `input_string` and returns a string (indicated by `-> str:`).

2. **Input String Splitting**:
   ```python
   numbers = input_string.split()
   ```
   This line splits the `input_string` into a list of space-delimited words using the `.split()` method. The resulting list is assigned to the variable `numbers`. This means that if the input string is `'three one five'`, then `numbers` will be `['three', 'one', 'five']`.

3. **Sorting the Numbers**:
   ```python
   sorted_numbers = ' '.join(sorted(numbers))
   ```
   This line takes the list of numbers and sorts it in ascending order using the `sorted()` function, which returns the sorted list. Then, the ` '.join()` method is used to convert the sorted list back into a string, and the result is assigned to the variable `sorted_numbers`.

4. **Returning the Sorted String**:
   ```python
   return sorted_numbers
   ```
   The function returns the value of `sorted_numbers`, which is the sorted and joined string, thereby completing the function.

The function effectively handles spaces and correctly sorts the numbers from smallest to largest, adhering to the problem statement. 

This function can now be incorporated into larger programs to sort strings of numbers as described.
