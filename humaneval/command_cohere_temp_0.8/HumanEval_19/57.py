```python
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    numbers = [int(char) for char in numbers.split()]
    numbers.sort()
    return ' '.join(map(str, numbers))
```
This Python script defines a function called `sort_numbers` which takes a string containing a sequence of numbers and sorts it in ascending order. The function splits the input string into individual numbers, converts them to integers, sorts the list of integers, and then joins the sorted numbers back into a string. This behavior is demonstrated in the provided test case, where the output is the sorted sequence 'one three five' for the input 'three one five'.
