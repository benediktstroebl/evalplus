```python
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    numbers = [int(char) for char in numbers.split()]
    numbers.sort()
    return ' '.join(map(str, numbers))
```
This Python script defines a function called `sort_numbers` which takes a string of numbers as input and returns a string with the numbers sorted from smallest to largest. 

The function first converts the space-delimited string of numbers into a list of integers. Then, it sorts this list in ascending order. Finally, the function returns a string whereby the sorted list of numbers is joined together with spaces. 

Such a string joining process can be achieved using Python's `str.join()` method or through a mapping the integers back to their string representations using `map()`. The latter approach is utilized in the code above. 

This Python function addresses the task presented in the challenge and should produce the correct output when given valid input. 

To examine the function under different scenarios, you can integrate it with automated tests. Here is an example of test-driven development: 
```python
def test_sort_numbers():
    assert sort_numbers('three one five') == 'one three five'
    assert sort_numbers('zero nine eight seven six five four three two one') == 'zero one two three four five six seven eight nine'
    assert sort_numbers('nine eight seven six five four three two one zero') == 'zero one two three four five six seven eight nine'
    assert sort_numbers('five four three two one') == 'one two three four five'
```

In the test suite above, the `test_sort_numbers` function asserts the behavior of the `sort_numbers` function for a few different inputs. 

You can run this test suite using Python to confirm that the function behaves as expected: `python -m unittest test_sort_numbers`. 

This approach of integrating tests in the code helps to validate the function's behavior, ensuring it remains consistent throughout future development or modifications.
