```python
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    numbers = [int(char) for char in numbers.split()]
    numbers.sort()
    return ' '.join(map(str, numbers))
```
This Python script defines a function called `sort_numbers` which takes a string parameter called `numbers`. The function first splits the string into a list of numbers, then sorts the list in ascending order, and finally joins the sorted numbers back into a string. This ensures that the input string, such as "three one five", is transformed into the sorted output string "one three five".
