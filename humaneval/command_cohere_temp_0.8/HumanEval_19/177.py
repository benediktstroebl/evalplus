```python
def sort_numbers(input_string: str) -> str:
    """
    Sorts a space-delimited string of numbers from shortest to longest.
    Valid input includes any combination of the numbers 'zero' to 'nine'.
    Returns the sorted string.
    """
    numbers = input_string.split()
    numbers.sort()
    return ' '.join(numbers)
```

This script takes an input string, splits it into a list of numbers, sorts that list, and then joins the numbers back into a string. While the provided test case sorts the numbers from 'one' to 'ten', the function is capable of sorting other combinations, such as 'four' and 'nine'. Ensuring that the input is solely comprised of the numbers 'zero' to 'nine' would be a sensible addition to both the problem description and the unit tests.
