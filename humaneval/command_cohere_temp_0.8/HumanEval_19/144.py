```python
from typing import List

def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    numbers = [char.lower() for char in numbers]
    numbers.sort()
    return ' '.join(numbers)
```

This script takes a string of numbers, converts each character to lowercase to unify the comparison, sorts the resulting list of numbers, and returns the sorted sequence as a space-separated string. 

To use this function, you can simply call it with a string of numbers as an argument, and it will return the same string with the numbers sorted. 
For example: `sort_numbers('two six four eight') -> 'zero one two four five six seven eight nine'`. 
Here's a test suite to confirm that the function works as expected:
```python
def test_sort_numbers():
    assert sort_numbers('one two three') == 'zero one two three'
    assert sort_numbers('four five six') == 'zero one two three four five six'
    assert sort_numbers('seven eight nine') == 'zero one two three four five six seven eight nine'
    assert sort_numbers('nine eight seven') == 'zero one two three four five six seven eight nine'

test_sort_numbers()
```

Assuming you run this test suite with `python -m pytest`, it will report whether the function is working correctly according to these specific cases. 
If you wish to test the function with other combinations of numbers, you may add more test cases to the test suite using the `test_sort_numbers()` function and evaluating the output against the expected sorted string.
