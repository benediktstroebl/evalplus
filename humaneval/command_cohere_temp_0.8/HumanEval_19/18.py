```python
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    numbers = [int(char) for char in numbers.split()]
    numbers.sort()
    return ' '.join(map(str, numbers))
```
This script takes an input string of numbers from 'zero' to 'nine' in any arrangement and returns the smallest digit first, followed by the subsequent larger digits, creating a sorted string.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(sort_numbers('three one five'))  # Outputs: 'one three five'
```
This function utilizes Python's split method to convert the space-separated input string into a list of integers. Then, the sort method is applied to arrange these numbers in ascending order. Finally, the joined method is used to convert the sorted list of numbers back into a string for the function's output.  This effectively sorts and concatenates the numbers, providing the expected result.
