```python
from typing import List

def sort_numbers(input_numbers: str) -> str:
    """ Input is a space-delimited string of numberals from 'zero' to 'nine'.
    Valid choices are 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight' and 'nine'.

```

This script takes an input string of numbers that are space-separated and sorted them in ascending order using the `sorted` function. The output is the smallest to largest sorted string.

Here are some example inputs and outputs to test the function:
```
input: 'nine eight seven six five four three two one zero'
output: 'zero one two three four five six seven eight nine'

input: 'five three one nine'
output: 'one three five nine'

input: 'seven six four two zero'
output: 'zero two four six seven'
``` 

This function should correctly solve the problem based on the provided test cases.
