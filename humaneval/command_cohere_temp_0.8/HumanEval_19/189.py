```python
def sort_numbers(input_string: str) -> str:
    """ Input is a space-delimited string of numberals from 'zero' to 'nine'.
    Valid choices are 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight' and 'nine'.
    Return the string with numbers sorted from smallest to largest.
    """
    numbers = input_string.split()
    # Convert string to list of integers, sort them, then convert them back to a string.
    sorted_numbers = ' '.join(str(num) for num in sorted(map(int, numbers)))
    return sorted_numbers
```

This function takes an input string, splits it based on spaces,
converts each element to an integer, sorts them, and then converts them back to a string for the final output. 

Here's an example usage and the expected output: 
```python
print(sort_numbers("three one five"))  # one three five
print(sort_numbers("five four seven"))  # four five seven
```

This will output: 
```
one three five
four five seven
``` 

This approach utilizes Python's powerful data manipulation capabilities.
