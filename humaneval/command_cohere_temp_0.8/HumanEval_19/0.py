```python
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    numbers = [int(char) for char in numbers.split()]
    numbers.sort()
    return ' '.join(map(str, numbers))
```
This Python script defines a function called `sort_numbers` which takes a string of space-separated numbers from 0-9 and sorts them in ascending order. The function first converts the input string into a list of integers using `split()` to separate the numbers and `int()` to convert each number. Then, it uses the `sort()` method to sort the numbers in ascending order. Finally, the function returns a string where the sorted numbers are joined back together with spaces using the `join()` method.

Here is an example usage of this function:
```python
print(sort_numbers('three one five'))  # Outputs: 'one three five'
```
This will print the sorted string 'one three five' as the output, which is the sorted version of the numbers in the input string 'three one five'.  Overall, the function efficiently sorts the numbers and creates the expected output, making it a useful tool for handling and transforming string-based numerical data.
