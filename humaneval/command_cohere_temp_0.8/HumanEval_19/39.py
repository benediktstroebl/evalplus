This script takes an input string of numbers that forms part of the function signature to avoid confusion with valid input. The function sorts the numbers and returns the sorted version with the numbers joined with a space as an output string. The function sorts the numbers from smallest to largest as requested in the prompt. This solution adheres to the problem constraints and passes the provided tests.
