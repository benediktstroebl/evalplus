```python
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    numbers = [int(char) for char in numbers.split()]
    numbers.sort()
    return ' '.join(map(str, numbers))
```
This Python script defines a function called `sort_numbers` which takes a string of numbers as input and returns a string with the numbers sorted from smallest to largest. 

The function splits the input string into a list of integers, sorts that list, and then joins the sorted integers back into a string. This algorithm sorts the numbers in the input string and produces a new string with the numbers arranged in ascending order. 

This code is self-contained and can be run without any additional dependencies or imports. It properly sorts the numbers according to the problem statement and requirements.

This code approach adheres to Python's PEP 8 style guide, which encourages the use of meaningful naming conventions, descriptive variable names, and a consistent coding style. This promotes code readability and maintainability.

Note that this code blocks the function from handling improper input gracefully, and incorrect or unexpected inputs may cause errors or unexpected behavior. It is advised to include error handling or input validation to improve the function's robustness.
