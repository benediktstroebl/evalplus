```python
def is_happy(s):
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    letters_count = [0] * 256  # Assuming ASCII
    for letter in s:
        letters_count[ord(letter)] += 1
    return all(count % 3 == 0 and count != 0 for count in letters_count[::3])
```

The happyness of the string is assessed in this solution by tallying the frequency of ASCII letters in the string and verifying that each letter is followed by a count that is a multiple of 3 and isn't zero, which indicates that the letters are spread out evenly and frequently. 

The following are some example inputs and expected outputs:
```
is_happy('abcd') -> True
is_happy('aabb') -> False
is_happy('adb') -> True
is_happy('xyy') -> False
``` 
You can complement your understanding by attempting to manually verify the happiness of each string in accordance with the spec.
