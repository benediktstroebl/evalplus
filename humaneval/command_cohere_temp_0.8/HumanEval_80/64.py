```python
def is_happy(s):
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    letters_set = set()
    for i in range(len(s)-2):
        if len(set([s[i], s[i + 1], s[i + 2]])) != 3:
            return False
    return True
```

The problem is solved iteratively in the `is_happy` function. It first checks if the string length is at least 3, if not, it returns `False`. Then, it checks if every 3 consecutive letters are distinct. For that, it builds a set of letters at the beginning of the string and compares it to the set of letters in every following 3-letter window. If the sets differ for any window, the function returns `False`, else it returns `True`. 

This approach avoids unnecessary computations and passes the test cases effectively.
