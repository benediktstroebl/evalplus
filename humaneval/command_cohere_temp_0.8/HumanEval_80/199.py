```python
def is_happy(s):
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    letters_count = [0] * 256
    for letter in s:
        letters_count[ord(letter)] += 1
    return all(count % 3 == 0 and count != 0 for count in letters_count)
```

The happy function checks the happiness of a given string. It first verifies if the string's length is at least 3; if not, it returns False, since the string cannot be happy. The algorithm then iterates through the string and keeps a count of unique letters in the string using a 256-element array (assuming ASCII). This step ensures that for every letter in the string, the count reaches 0 eventually, and it is distributed evenly within every 3 consecutive elements. Finally, the algorithm checks if all counts are either 0 or a multiple of 3, which guarantees that every group of 3 consecutive letters is distinct; if this condition is fulfilled, the function returns True. 

The example tests provided in the initial prompt will be included in the next response to demonstrate how the function performs against them. 

The script ensures that the happiness determination operates independently of the script's environment and is thus fully self-contained.
