```python
def is_happy(s):
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    letters_set = set(s)
    return len(letters_set) == len(s) - 2
```

The function `is_happy()` takes a single argument `s`, which is the string to be checked for happiness. 

The function first checks if the string's length is at least 3 using the `len(s) < 3` condition. If the length is less than 3, it returns `False` since a happy string must have at least three letters to form consecutive pairs.

Next, it uses a set `letters_set` to store the unique letters in the string `s`. The happiness condition states that every consecutive trio of letters should be distinct, so we subtract 2 from the set's length to account for the repetitions of each letter in the trio.

Finally, the function returns `True` if every 3 consecutive letters are distinct, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is a test suite to ensure its correctness:
```python
# Test cases
test_cases = [
    "abcd", "adb", "xyz", "uvw", "beta", "code",
    "ca", "aaa", "bbb", "aaa bb", "cbb",
    "Happy", "Unhappy",
    "abcd dedf", "abcf", "abcdef"
]

# Validation
assert all(is_happy(test_case) for test_case in test_cases)
```

The above test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases, to ensure that the `is_happy()` function is correctly determining whether a given string is happy or not. 

The `all()` statement iterates through each element in the list of test cases and checks if each result of the `is_happy()` function is `True`. 

If all the values are `True`, the assertion passes and indicates that the function is functioning correctly. 

Any counterexample would cause the assertion to fail and provide an error, helping to identify whether the function needs to be revised.
