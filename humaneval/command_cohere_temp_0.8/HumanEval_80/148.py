```python
def is_happy(s):
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    letters_set = set()
    for i in range(len(s)-2):
        if len(set([s[i], s[i + 1], s[i + 2]])) != 3:
            return False
    return True
```

This Python script defines a function called `is_happy` that takes a single argument - a string of characters `s`. This function returns `True` if the string is "happy", and `False` otherwise. 

The purpose of this function is to determine if a given string satisfies a specific condition:
 - A "happy" string is one with a minimum length of three characters.
 - Additionally, every set of three consecutive letters must be unique within the string.

To break down how the function works:
1. **Length Check**: Initially, the function verifies if the string's length is at least three characters. If not, it means the input string cannot be happy, so the function returns False immediately.
2. **Consecutive Letter Check**: Next, the function uses nested loops to check every possible set of three consecutive letters in the string. It uses a set called `letters_set` to keep track of the letters encountered so far to avoid duplicates.
3. **Unique Letters**: For each set of three consecutive letters, the function checks if they form a unique set within the string. If any set of three consecutive letters is encountered more than once in the string, the function returns False.
4. **Happy String**: If the function successfully iterates through the entire string without finding any repeated consecutive triplets, it returns True, indicating a happy string.

This solution follows a concise and efficient approach that boasts a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as it needs to process each character only once. The space complexity is O(n) due to the usage of the `letters_set` data structure to keep track of encountered letters.
