```python
def is_happy(s):
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    letters_set = set()
    for i in range(len(s)-2):
        if len(set([s[i], s[i + 1], s[i + 2]])) != 3:
            return False
    return True
```

This code defines a function `is_happy` that takes a string `s` as input and checks whether it is happy as described in the prompt. 

It first checks if the string's length is at least 3, and if not, it returns `False`. This ensures that the string length is at least 3 to be considered happy.

Then, it utilizes the `letters_set` object to iterate over each group of 3 consecutive letters in the string, and uses set membership to check if each set of 3 consecutive letters is distinct. If any group of 3 letters is not unique, it returns `False`. If it passes this condition, it returns `True`.

This code will accurately determine whether a given string is happy or not and is compatible with the test cases provided in the prompt.
