```python
def is_happy(s):
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    letters_dict = {}
    letters_list = []
    for i in range(len(s)-2):
        letters_list.append(s[i:i+3])
    for l in letters_list:
        if l not in letters_dict:
            letters_dict[l] = 1
        else:
            letters_dict[l] += 1
    for count in letters_dict.values():
        if count > 1:
            return False
    return True
```

The following is an explanation of how the code works:
1. The `is_happy` function takes a single argument - a string `s`, and returns `True` if the string is "happy" as per the problem definition, and `False` otherwise.
2. It starts by checking if the string's length is at least 3 using the `len(s) < 3` condition. Strings shorter than this are not considered happy, so the function returns `False`.
3. It initializes a dictionary called `letters_dict` to store the frequencies of each triplet of letters, and an empty list called `letters_list` to store the consecutive letters of the input string.
4. The loop `for i in range(len(s)-2)` iterates over the input string `s`, excluding the last two characters. For each triplet of consecutive letters, it appends them to the `letters_list`.
5. After creating the `letters_list`, the code iterates through each triplet of letters in the list and counts the occurrences of each triplet in the `letters_dict`. If a triplet is encountered for the first time, it's added to the dictionary with a count of 1. If the triplet is already in the dictionary, its count is incremented.
6. The function then iterates through the values of the `letters_dict` and checks if any count is greater than 1. If so, it returns `False` because duplicate consecutive letters are present in the string.
7. If the loop completes without finding any duplicate consecutive letter triplets, it means the string is "happy," and the function returns `True`.

The tests this code should pass are:
```python
test_is_happy_positive_cases = {
    "abcd": True,
    "adb":  True,
    "xyy":  False,
    "aabb": False,
}

test_is_happy_negative_cases = {
    "a": False,
    "aa": False,
    "zza": False,
    "abbb": False,
    "bacd": False,
}
``` 

The tests are commented out, as they are not a part of the original problem statement and thus are not reproducible without the test suite.
