```python
def is_happy(s):
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    letters_set = set(s[0:3])
    if len(letters_set) < 3:
        return False
    for i in range(3, len(s)):
        if s[i] not in letters_set:
            letters_set.add(s[i])
        else:
            return False
    return True
```

The following simple steps illustrate how the algorithm works:
1. The method verifies whether the string's length is at least 3. If not, it returns False since happiness cannot be established with fewer than three characters.
2. The first three letters are extracted from the string and added to a set to simulate uniqueness verification.
3. The set is checked to see if it has a minimum of 3 elements. It returns False if not, since the first three letters must always be distinct.
4. The algorithm checks whether each of the following letters is distinct from the first three. It adds them to the set and returns False if they are not. The set will have at least four elements at this point, and the subsequent letters will be added to it.
5. If the above conditions are satisfied, True is returned, indicating that the string is "happy." 

This algorithm efficiently determines happiness with a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the input string s.
