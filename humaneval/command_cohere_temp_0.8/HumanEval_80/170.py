```python
def is_happy(s):
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    letters_set = set()
    for i in range(len(s)-2):
        if len(set([s[i], s[i + 1], s[i + 2]])) != 3:
            return False
    return True
```

The problem asks us to create a function that checks if a given string is "happy". The function first checks if the length of the string is at least 3, if not it returns False as combinations of two letters or a single letter cannot be happy. If the string length is greater than or equal to 3, it checks if every trio of consecutive letters is unique, if not it returns False, if so, it returns True. The given code uses a set in range iterations to check for unique triples to achieve a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the string and uses len() to check for the minimum required length of the string, resulting in a worst-case time complexity of O(1). It is important to mention that this problem can be optimized to O(n) with a single traversal using shifts and sliding windows.  This solution offers a straightforward way to implement the more complex approach, and it handles the basic edge cases correctly, which is a happy face for happy users.
