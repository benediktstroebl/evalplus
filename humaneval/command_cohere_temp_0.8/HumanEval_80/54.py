```python
def is_happy(s):
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    letters_set = set(s[0:3])
    if len(letters_set) < 3:
        return False
    for i in range(3, len(s)):
        if s[i] in letters_set:
            return False
    return True
```

The problem asks us to create a function `is_happy` that checks if a given string is "happy". A happy string is one where the length is at least 3 and each set of 3 consecutive letters are distinct. The Python script I have provided defines a function `is_happy` that takes a string as an input and returns either `True` or `False` depending on if the string is happy or not. It checks if the string length is at least 3 using the `if` condition. It then checks if each set of 3 consecutive letters are distinct by creating a set of the first 3 letters and checking if the set length is smaller than or equal to 3. If it is, then it returns `False` as the set of 3 letters should have more than 3 elements to cover all permutations of 3 letters. Otherwise, it checks each subsequent set of 3 letters and returns `False` if any of these sets are not distinct. Overall, the script defines a function that correctly checks the happiness of a string.
