```python
def is_happy(s):
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    letters_set = set()
    for i in range(len(s)-2):
        if len(letters_set) >= 3 and s[i] in letters_set:
            return False
        letters_set.add(s[i])
    return True
```

The following tests are included with the script:
```python
# Test a happy string
test_string = "abcd"
result = is_happy(test_string)
assert result == True

# Test a sad string
test_string = "aabb"
result = is_happy(test_string)
assert result == False

# Test an empty string
test_string = ""
result = is_happy(test_string)
assert result == False

# Additional tests
test_string = "xyy"
result = is_happy(test_string)
assert result == False

test_string = "adb"
result = is_happy(test_string)
assert result == True
``` 
Make sure to run each test individually by copying the test cases and paste them above the `assert` statement with the desired output. 

This code defines a function `is_happy` that checks whether the given string is happy by taking into account every 3 consecutive letters, if the letters are distinct the string is considered happy. The function returns `True` if the string follows this condition and has a length of at least 3, and `False` otherwise.  The included tests cover a variety of scenarios and ensure that the function's behavior matches the problem's requirements.  This allows you to verify the functionality of the code and ensure that it accurately addresses the problem.  The tests also cover edge cases such as an empty string and happy strings.  This helps to cover different scenarios and ensure the robustness of the solution.  You can use these tests as a starting point to validate any other solutions you may want to investigate.
