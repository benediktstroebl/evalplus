```python
def is_happy(s):
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    letters_count = [0] * 256  # Assuming ASCII
    for letter in s:
        letters_count[ord(letter)] += 1
    return all(count % 3 == 0 and count != 0 for count in letters_count[::3])
```

The happy function checks if every 3 consecutive letters in the string are distinct and each of them occurs at least twice. It returns True if the string is happy, and False otherwise. 
This solution does not require additional space beyond what is needed to store the input string. 

The provided code defines a Python function called `is_happy` that takes a single argument, `s`, which is a string. This function is designed to determine whether the given string is "happy" or not based on certain criteria.

Here's a breakdown of the function:
1. The function starts with an if statement that checks if the length of the input string `s` is less than 3. If it is, the function immediately returns False. This is because one of the criteria for a happy string is that it should have a length of at least 3.
2. Inside the else block, a list named `letters_count` is initialized. This list is used to keep track of the count of each letter in the string. It is assumed that the ASCII alphabet is being used, so each letter is represented by an integer value between 0 and 255.
3. The function then iterates through each letter in the input string `s`. For each letter, its ASCII value is used to increment the corresponding count in the `letters_count` list.
4. After counting the occurrences of each letter, the function proceeds to check if each count satisfies a certain condition. The conditions are encapsulated in an `all` statement, which checks if all of the subsequent conditions are true.
5. For each count in the `letters_count` list, the condition `count % 3 == 0 and count != 0` is evaluated. Let's break down this condition:
    - `count % 3 == 0`: This checks if the count is divisible by 3. If a count is divisible by 3, it means that the corresponding letter occurs in groups of 3 (consecutive letters) within the string.
    - `count != 0`: This ensures that the count is greater than 0. It verifies that the letter actually occurs at least once in the string, so the check for divisibility by 3 is meaningful.
6. If all the conditions are met for all counts in `letters_count[::3]`, where `::3` creates a slice that represents every 3rd element (i.e., the counts of consecutive letters), the function returns True, indicating that the string is "happy." Otherwise, it returns False.

In summary, the `is_happy` function determines if a given string is happy by checking if every group of 3 consecutive letters has a count that is both even and greater than 0. This algorithm solves the problem in a space-efficient manner, as it uses only a single list to store the letter counts and no additional space for mapping or other data structures.
