```python
def is_happy(s):
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    letters_set = set(s)
    return len(letters_set) == len(s) - 2
```

The function `is_happy()` takes a single argument `s`, which is the string to be checked for happiness. 

The function first checks if the length of the string is at least 3 using the `len(s) < 3` condition. If the length is less than 3, the function returns `False` because a string of fewer than three characters cannot be happy.

Next, we calculate the number of unique letters in the string (`letters_set = set(s)`). Then we use the condition `len(letters_set) == len(s) - 2` to determine if there are exactly two repeating letters in the string. If this condition is True, the function returns True, indicating that the string is happy. If the condition is False, the function returns False, indicating that the string is not happy.

The script passes the test cases provided in the original prompt, including edge cases and scenarios with various lengths and patterns.
