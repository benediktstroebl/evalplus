```python
def is_happy(s):
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    letters_set = set(s[0:3])
    for i in range(3, len(s), 3):
        if len(set(s[i:i+3])) != 3:
            return False
    return True
```

The problem asks us to determine if a string is happy. A happy string is one where the length is at least 3 and each set of 3 consecutive letters are distinct. The code defines a function `is_happy` which uses set comprehension to check if every group of 3 letters is unique. It returns `True` if the string follows this pattern, and `False` otherwise. 

**Note:** This solution dominates the algorithm as it takes O(n) time, where n is the length of the string, and is the worst-case time complexity. However, this is a concise and effective solution for the problem.
