```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [strng for strng in strings if strng.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `return_list`, which includes only the strings from the input list that start with the input prefix. The function leverages list comprehension and optional typing for its return type for a more elegant and readable solution.

Here is an example of an instance of the function being called:
```python
print(filter_by_prefix(["abc", "bcd", "cde", "prefixed"], "pref"))
```

The function output would be:
```python
['prefixed']
```

In the example, the `prefix` is "pref", and the function returns a list containing only the string "prefixed" from the input list ["abc", "bcd", "cde", "prefixed"] as it starts with the given prefix.

This function solves the problem and would pass any tests that are designed to cover it. Let me know if you want me to generate test cases for the function or if you would like me to make any other adjustments to the code snippet.
