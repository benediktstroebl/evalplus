```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [string for string in strings if string.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a prefix, `prefix`. It returns a new list containing only the strings from the input list that start with the specified prefix. This behavior is achieved using a list comprehension, filtering strings based on the `startswith` method.

The function is self-contained, meaning it does not rely on external variables or context, and can be invoked and utilized anywhere within Python with favorable python versions typing functionality and List comprehension syntax. 

To further cement this function's correctness, consider adding test cases in the vicinity of the function declaration. These could take the shape of unittest assertions or civete tests, providing an assurance of function behavior against various inputs. An example test case is provided below. 

```python
# Test the filter_by_prefix function
def test_filter_by_prefix():
    # Empty list and non-empty prefix
    assert filter_by_prefix([], 'a') == []

    # List with matching strings and non-empty prefix
    assert filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a') == ['abc', 'array']

    # List with only matching strings and empty prefix
    assert filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'array'], '') == ['abc', 'array']

    # List with no matching strings and empty prefix
    assert filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'ray'], 'a') == []
```
