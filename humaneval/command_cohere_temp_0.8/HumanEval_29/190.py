```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [string for string in strings if string.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `return_list`, which contains only the strings from `strings` that start with the `prefix`. The list comprehension performs the filtering based on the start equality. 

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```python
>>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
['abc', 'array']
```

The example includes a list of strings and a prefix string and verifies that the result only contains the elements that start with the specified prefix.
