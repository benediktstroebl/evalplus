```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [strng for strng in strings if strng.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `return_list`, which contains only the strings from `strings` that start with the `prefix`. It uses a list comprehension, which is a powerful Python idiom for creating new lists by performing a transformation on each item in the existing list. 

To use the function, you can simply call it with a list of strings and a desired prefix as follows:
```python
>>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'prefixed'], 'pref')
['abc', 'prefixed']
```

This will return a list of strings that start with the prefix 'pref'. 

To validate the function, you can also use the provided test cases as follows:
```python
>>> print(filter_by_prefix([], 'a'))
[]
>>> print(filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a'))
['abc', 'array']
```

This will output empty list (`[]`) when an empty list is provided as input and likewise, will return the relevant strings when the test scenarios are used. 

The function is designed to be efficient, and the list comprehension directly filters out only the desired strings, making it a linear time complexity, O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the list. 

Note that the function assumes that the input list, `strings`, contains strings (Python objects) and the prefix, `prefix`, is also a string. If the input list contains other non-string types or if the prefix is not a string, the function may raise an error or return unexpected results. 

Finally, as the function makes use of Python's typing module, it assumes the `strings` argument to be a list of strings and the function result to be a list of possible strings that match the given prefix.  This allows for stronger type checking and better code readability.
