```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `return_list`, which contains only the strings from `strings` that start with the `prefix`. It uses a list comprehension, `return_list = [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]`, to iterate over each string in the input list and check if it starts with the input prefix. If it does, the string is included in the resultant list. If it does not, it is excluded from the list. 

This solution passes the given tests because:
- If the input list, `strings`, is empty, the function returns an empty list, as there are no strings to filter. 
- If the input list contains strings that start with the prefix, those strings will be included in the resultant list. 
- If the input list contains strings that do not start with the prefix, those strings will be excluded from the resultant list. 

This solution is concise and efficient in solving the problem statement and can be easily utilized in other parts of the project that may need string filtering based on a prefix. 

The markdown code block with this code would be formatted as follows:
```
```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]
```
```
This solution incorporates the function `filter_by_prefix` and can be reused in other scripts that need a list filtration based on a prefix. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
