```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [string for string in strings if string.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `List[str]`, containing only the strings from the input list that start with the input prefix. This is achieved using a list comprehension, filtering out the elements that have a prefix that doesn't match the input `prefix`. This is the underlying logic: `return [string for string in strings if string.startswith(prefix)]`. 

The list comprehension loops over each `string` in the `strings` list and builds a new list with the strings starting with the `prefix`. The `string.startswith(prefix)` expression evaluates to `True` if the `string` starts with the `prefix` and is used in the list comprehension to select the strings that satisfy this condition. 

The function's docstring describes its purpose, provides a concise example, and exemplifies usage with specified test cases. This enhances its readability and facilitates its understanding and utilization. 

You can employ this function to filter a list of strings based on a provided prefix, effectively facilitating your data processing needs.
