```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [strng for strng in strings if strng.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `return_list`, which contains only the strings from `strings` that start with the `prefix`. It uses a list comprehension, which is a concise way to create a new list by applying an operation to each item in the existing list.

The result is a filtered list that includes only the strings that start with the specified prefix. This allows you to efficiently extract and retain relevant strings from a large list based on a common prefix. 

This solution should address the problem statement and can be added to the existing markdown code block with the updated function and an additional test case for the new case. 
Here is an example of such an addition: 
```python
def test_filter_by_prefix():
    # Empty list and non-empty prefix
    assert not filter_by_prefix([], "a")

    # List with one matching element
    assert filter_by_prefix(["abc"], "a") == ["abc"]

    # List with multiple matching elements
    assert filter_by_prefix(["abc", "array", "bite"], "a") == ["abc", "array"]

    # List with non-matching elements and one matching element
    assert filter_by_prefix(["abc", "bit", "array"], "a") == ["abc", "array"]
``` 

This test case will validate the new function and its behavior against the new case.
