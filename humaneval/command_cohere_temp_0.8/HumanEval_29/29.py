```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `List[str]`, containing only the strings from the input list that start with the specified prefix. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each string in the input `strings` and checks if it starts with the `prefix`. If a string starts with the prefix, it's included in the resulting list. If not, it's excluded from the list. This functionality allows you to filter a list of strings efficiently based on a specific starting prefix. 

The function is designed to handle both empty input lists and cases where the prefix doesn't match any strings in the list, in which cases it would return an empty list.

To manage real-world scenarios, the function expects the `strings` list to be non-empty, and the `prefix` to be a string.

This versatile function can be applied to various scenarios, such as filtering a list of file paths to those that correspond to a specific directory, or selecting email addresses that start with a specific username.
