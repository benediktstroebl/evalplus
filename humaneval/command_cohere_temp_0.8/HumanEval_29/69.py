```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [strng for strng in strings if strng.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `return_list`, which includes only the strings from the input list that start with the input prefix. The function uses a list comprehension, which is a concise way to create a new list by performing a transformation on each item in an existing list.

To use the `filter_by_prefix` function, you can simply call it with your list of strings and the desired prefix as shown in the given example:
```python
>>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
['abc', 'array']
``` 

This will return a list that only includes the strings 'abc' and 'array', which are the only elements in the provided example that begin with the 'a' prefix. 
The stringification process in this function is straightforward, since the intention is to compare string prefixes, the input list contains strings, and the output list is also comprised of strings. 

This implementation is straightforward, intuitive, and suitable for the problem at hand. It has a medium level of complexity, and it's suitable for most coding scenarios.  It's important to note that, if needed, this function can be further optimized. For example, using convolutional optimization, as in the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm, if it becomes a recurring operation or if the list gets large.
