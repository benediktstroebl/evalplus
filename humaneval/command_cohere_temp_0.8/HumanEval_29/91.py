```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [strng for strng in strings if strng.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `return_list`, which includes only the strings from the input list that start with the input prefix.

The logic is implemented using a list comprehension, which is a concise way to perform operations on each item in a list. Here, the list comprehension checks each element in the `strings` list to see if it starts with the `prefix`. If it does, the string is included in the `return_list`. The resulting list is then returned as the function output. 

This approach allows the function to efficiently filter the list based on the prefix while maintaining readability and clarity in the code. 
The function is also annotated with the `typing` module to specify the types of the input and return values, which helps ensure type safety and provide better documentation. In the code snippet, the function `filter_by_prefix` takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a prefix, `prefix`, as input. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the input list. For each string, it checks if the string starts with the provided prefix using the `startswith` method. If it does, the string is included in the resulting list, which is returned as the output of the function. 

The function annotated with type hints, indicating that it accepts a list of strings, `List[str]`, and a prefix string, `str` as inputs, and it returns a list of strings, `List[str]`. These type hints provide information about the expected types of arguments and the return value, enhancing code readability and enabling better documentation and usage. 

The function is designed to be reusable and efficient, and it can be easily applied to various scenarios where filtering based on a prefix is required.  It eliminates the need for explicit loops and conditions, making the code more concise and readable.  The approach taken in the function is both efficient and effective in solving the problem and is consistent with Python's philosophy of expressiveness and conciseness.
