```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `return_list`, which contains only the strings from `strings` that start with the `prefix`. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each string in `strings` and returns the ones that start with the input `prefix`. 

Here's an example of how you can use the `filter_by_prefix()` function with specific test cases to verify its functionality:
```python
def test_filter_by_prefix():
    # Test case 1: Empty input list, non-empty prefix
    assert not filter_by_prefix([], "a")

    # Test case 2: List with matching strings, non-empty prefix
    assert filter_by_prefix( ["abc", "bcd", "cde", "array"], "a") == ["abc", "array"]

    # Test case 3: List with non-matching strings, non-empty prefix
    assert not filter_by_prefix( ["xyz", "bcd", "cde", "array"], "a")

    # Test case 4: Empty input list, empty prefix
    assert filter_by_prefix([], "") == []

    # Test case 5: Empty input list, empty string
    assert not filter_by_prefix([], "")

test_filter_by_prefix()
```

In this example, the `test_filter_by_prefix()` function provides test cases to validate the behavior of the `filter_by_prefix()` function. Each test case verifies whether the function returns the expected results for specific inputs.

The first test case, `assert not filter_by_prefix([], "a")`, checks if the function correctly returns an empty list when an empty list of strings is provided with a non-empty prefix. 

The second test case, `assert filter_by_prefix( ["abc", "bcd", "cde", "array"], "a") == ["abc", "array"]`, ensures that the function returns only the strings from the input list that start with the specified prefix, in this case, "a". 

The third test case, `assert not filter_by_prefix( ["xyz", "bcd", "cde", "array"], "a")`, verifies that the function correctly handles non-matching strings in the input list, as none of the strings start with "a". 

The fourth test case, `assert filter_by_prefix([], "") == []`, confirms that the function returns an empty list when both the input list and the prefix are empty. 

The last test case, `assert not filter_by_prefix([], "")`, ensures that the function recognizes that an empty string is different from no prefix and returns an empty list. 

Feel free to add more test cases to cover other scenarios and corner cases in your specific context.
