```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [string for string in strings if string.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `return_list`, which includes only the strings from the input list that start with the input prefix. The functionality is demonstrated by the following example:
```python
>>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
['abc', 'array']
```

The `filter_by_prefix` function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the input `strings` list. For each string, it checks if the string starts with the input `prefix` by using the `startswith` method. If the string starts with the prefix, it is included in the resulting list. The list comprehension iterates freely over the list and filters elements based on the prefix condition, resulting in an efficient and concise solution. 
The function's type hinting also specifies that the input list should be of type `List[str]` and the output list should be of the same type, ensuring compatibility and proper typing information. In addition, the function includes a docstring, providing a brief description of its purpose, the expected input format, and an example to demonstrate how to use it. 
This improves code readability and makes it easier for developers to understand and use the function correctly in their applications. Glossary:
- **List**: A list is a versatile collection of objects in Python, allowing the storage of multiple elements in a single variable.
- **Type Hinting**: Type hinting is the process of adding optional annotations to variable names or function signatures to specify the expected types of values they can accept.
- **List Comprehension**: List comprehension is a concise and expressive way to create new lists by applying an expression to each item in an existing list and optionally filtering the items based on a condition.
- **Startswith**: The startswith method is used to check if a string starts with a specified prefix substring. It returns `True` if the prefix is found at the beginning of the string, and `False` otherwise. 
- **Docstring**: A docstring is a string literal that serves as documentation for a Python function, method, or class and is traditionally multi-line text indented twice to signal its intent. 
Overall, the provided code offers a clear and efficient solution to the problem, with a focus on readability and functionality. Glossary terms introduce additional insights into the techniques used and promote better understanding of the code's inner workings.
