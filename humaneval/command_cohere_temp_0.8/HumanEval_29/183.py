```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [strng for strng in strings if strng.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `return_list`, which contains only the strings from the input list that start with the given prefix. The function uses a list comprehension, which is a concise way to create a new list by performing a transformation on each item in an existing list.

The concise nature of the list comprehension affords the function a logical reading direction from left to right, making it easier to understand. It also ensures that the function remains performant, as it is not introducing any additional loops that could impact its speed.

The function does not modify the input list, instead, it returns a new list containing the filtered strings. This is in line with the standard behavior of Python functions and ensures that the original list is preserved unchanged. 

The function handles empty input lists gracefully, as shown in the example below:
```python
>>> filter_by_prefix([], 'a')
[]
```
This empty list, `[]`, is returned directly, as the input list is devoid of strings that match the given prefix. 

The function also works correctly with a variety of input lists and prefixes, as shown in the example below:
```python
>>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
['abc', 'array']
``` 
In this example, the function returns a list of just two strings: 'abc' and 'array'. These are the only strings in the input list that start with the 'a' prefix. 

This makes the function versatile and adaptable to various use cases, as its behavior remains consistent regardless of the specific inputs it is tasked to process.
