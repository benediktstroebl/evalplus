```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [strng for strng in strings if strng.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `List[str]`, that contains only the strings from the input list that start with the input prefix. The function uses a list comprehension, which is a concise way to create a new list by applying an operation to each item in the existing list.

The underlying logic behind the list comprehension in the `filter_by_prefix` function is as follows:
```python
return [strng for strng in strings if strng.startswith(prefix)]
```

Here's an explanation of each step:
1. `strng for strng in strings` — This is a list comprehension, which creates a new list of elements from the list of strings, iterating through each element (referred to as `strng`) in the process.
2. `if strng.startswith(prefix)` — This is the filtering condition. The `startswith()` method checks if the string `strng` starts with the given prefix, and it returns `True` if it does, and `False` otherwise. 
3. `[]` — This is an empty list that is returned when there are no matches (i.e., when the list of strings is empty or none of the strings start with the given prefix). 

The function returns a list of matching strings, which makes it easy to integrate with other Python applications and enables chaining and other advanced functionality in the Python ecosystem.

The function includes type hints, specifying that the input parameter `strings` is of type `List[str]` and the return type is also `List[str]`. These annotations help to provide clearer code documentation and enable editor support and code analysis tools to provide more accurate feedback and auto-completion.

You can continue to build upon this code snippet to solve a wide range of problems and analyze the behavior of the filter_by_prefix function on different inputs and edge cases, ensuring that your solution is correct, efficient, and reliable.
