```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [strng for strng in strings if strng.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `return_list`, which contains only the strings from the input list that start with the input prefix. The function leverages list comprehension and the `startswith` method to efficiently filter the desired strings from the input list based on the provided prefix. 

To test this function, you can use the following code:
```python
import unittest

class TestFilterByPrefix(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_empty_list_no_match(self):
        result = filter_by_prefix([], 'a')
        self.assertEqual(result, [])

    def test_list_with_matching_strings(self):
        result = filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
        self.assertEqual(result, ['abc', 'array'])

    def test_list_with_multiple_prefixes(self):
        result = filter_by_prefix(['apple', 'appetizer', 'orange', 'watermelon'], 'app')
        self.assertEqual(result, ['apple', 'appetizer'])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This test suite contains three distinct test functions aimed at validating various scenarios of the `filter_by_prefix()` function. In the `test_empty_list_no_match` function, an empty list is passed as input, and thus, the function returns an empty list as well. In the `test_list_with_matching_strings` function, a list containing various strings, including some starting with the prefix "a", is passed. The function's output is compared to the expected list, confirming the correct filtering of strings with the "a" prefix. Lastly, the `test_list_with_multiple_prefixes` function checks the function's ability to filter strings that share a different prefix, "app", from the provided list. 

Executing this code will generate a detailed test report, allowing you to promptly identify any gaps or errors in the function's implementation. 

This script provides a self-contained function that solves the problem statement and incorporates a complete test suite to ensure its correctness. You can use this code to effectively solve the problem and validate its accuracy against various test cases.
