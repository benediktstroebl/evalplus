```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `return_list`, which contains only the strings from the input list that start with the input prefix. 

To achieve this, it uses a list comprehension, which is a powerful Python idiom for creating new lists by performing a transformation on each item in the existing list. In this case, the transformation is to filter strings that start with `prefix`. 

The `s.startswith(prefix)` expression within the list comprehension returns True if the string `s` starts with the prefix `prefix`, and only those strings for which this expression is `True` get included in the returned list. 

The function includes type hints, which are a feature of Python that allow you to specify the types of variables, and return meaningful informative documentation, via the `return` statement, on the expected output of the function. 

The expected output is nicely demonstrated by example in the accompanying docstring, which is a block of documentation text enclosed in triple-quoted strings (usually starting with three backticks) that appears directly after the function definition. 

Overall, the function is elegantly written, demonstrates Python's expressive list comprehension, and benefits from idiomatic Python enhancements such as type hints and docstrings.
