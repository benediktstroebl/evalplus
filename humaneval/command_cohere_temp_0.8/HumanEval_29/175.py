```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [strng for strng in strings if strng.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `return_list`, which includes only the strings from the input list that start with the input prefix. The function utilizes list comprehension and a recursive typing module, `List`, for concise type annotations. 

To ensure the function performs as designed, let's conduct tests using Python's built-in `unittest` module: 
```python
import unittest

class TestFilterByPrefix(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_empty_strings(self):
        self.assertEqual(filter_by_prefix([], 'a'), [])

    def test_single_match(self):
        self.assertEqual(filter_by_prefix(['abc'], 'a'), ['abc'])

    def test_multiple_matches(self):
        self.assertEqual(filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'array', 'bcde'], 'a'), ['abc', 'array'])

    def test_no_matches(self):
        self.assertEqual(filter_by_prefix(['bc', 'def', 'ghij'], 'a'), [])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This test suite includes four individual test functions, each of which tests the `filter_by_prefix` function in a specific scenario. The `unittest.main()` function is crucial for discovering and running tests automatically. To run the tests, ensure the Python test runner is installed and execute the script via the command line:
```bash
python test_filter_by_prefix.py
```

For detailed insights, you can view the output on the console after running the command; it'll display detailed information about which tests succeeded or failed, their assertions, and other related information. 

This way, you can be confident that the function works correctly across various scenarios and delivers expected results.
