```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [strng for strng in strings if strng.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `List[str]`, that includes only the strings from the input list that start with the input prefix. The function is self-contained and can be used to solve the problem as stated. It also passes the tests provided since it follows the expected behavior of the problem. You can verify this by running the following code:
```python
>>> filter_by_prefix([], 'a')
[]
>>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
['abc', 'array']
``` 
The expected output above corresponds to the test cases provided in the original problem description.
