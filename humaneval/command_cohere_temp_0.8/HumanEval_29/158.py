```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [string for string in strings if string.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `List[str]`, containing only the strings from the input list that start with the input prefix. The function utilizes list comprehension, creating a new list by filtering strings using the `startswith` method. 

To test this function, you can use the following inputs and expected outputs:
```python
>>> filter_by_prefix([], 'a')
[]
>>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
['abc', 'array']
>>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'ar')
['array']
```

This will help ensure that the function performs as expected, providing a reliable tool for filtering lists of strings based on their prefixes, in line with problem specifications.
