```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `return_list`, which contains only the strings from `strings` that begin with `prefix`. It uses a list comprehension, `return_list = [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]`, to iterate over each string in `strings` and check if it starts with the specified `prefix`. If a string starts with `prefix`, it's included in the resulting list. If not, it's excluded from the list. 

The function is self-contained, meaning it doesn't require any external dependencies or additional functionality to work. It's designed solely to solve the problem of filtering a list of strings based on a provided prefix, making it concise and modular. 

To verify the correctness of the function, you can perform the following:
```python
# Test Case 1
input_list = ['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array']
prefix = 'a'
expected_result = ['abc', 'array']

result = filter_by_prefix(input_list, prefix)

assert result == expected_result
```

```python
# Test Case 2
input_list = ['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array']
prefix = 'b'
expected_result = ['bcd']

result = filter_by_prefix(input_list, prefix)

assert result == expected_result
```

These tests ensure that the `filter_by_prefix` function produces the expected results for different test cases. 

This function can be easily incorporated into larger projects or utilized as a standalone function in a variety of scenarios where list filtering is required.
