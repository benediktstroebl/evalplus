```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `List[str]`, that includes only the strings from the input list that start with the input prefix. The function utilizes list comprehension and a generator expression to filter out the eligible strings. To ensure compatibility, the function is also annotated with the `typing` module.

To test this function, you can use the following sample inputs and expected outputs:
```python
>>> filter_by_prefix([], 'a')
[]
>>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
['abc', 'array']
>>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'ar')
['array']
```

This updated method employs the list comprehension approach, which is both more concise and easier to understand. Additionally, the function annotation with `typing` ensures compatibility with typing modules, a growing trend in modern Python development.
