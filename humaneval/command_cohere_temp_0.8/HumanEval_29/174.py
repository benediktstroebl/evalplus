```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [strng for strng in strings if strng.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `return_list`, which includes only the strings from the input list that start with the input prefix. The function uses a list comprehension, which is a concise way to create a new list by applying an operation to each item in the existing list. 

To use the `filter_by_prefix` function, you can call it with a list of strings and a desired prefix as shown in the below example:
```python
>>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'prefixed'], 'pref')
['prefixed']
``` 

In this example, it returns the string 'prefixed' which is the only string in the provided list that has a prefix matching the given prefix, 'pref'. 

You can also provide an empty list or no input argument for the `strings` parameter. In this case, the function would return an empty list as shown in the example below:
```python
>>> filter_by_prefix([], 'a')
[]
``` 

This function is straightforward and robust, benefiting from Python's powerful list comprehension and type-checking features. It handles empty input gracefully and efficiently filters strings based on the prefix match requirement. 

This function includes typehints on the function signatures, which are useful for documenting the expected input and output types of the function, and improve the readability of the code. 

These improvements make the code more readable and maintainable, and help ensure that the function is correctly typed which will reduce the chances of running into errors due to type mismatches.
