```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a prefix, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `List[str]`, containing only the strings from the input list that start with the specified prefix. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the input list and checks if it starts with the provided prefix using the `startswith` method. If the string starts with the prefix, it is included in the resulting list. If it does not, it is excluded from the list. 

The function is designed to be self-contained, meaning it can be dropped into any Python project, and it will happily operate on any passed-in list of strings, helping to streamline coding tasks related to filtering lists. 

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```python
>>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
['abc', 'array']
>>> filter_by_prefix(['123', '456', '789', '1000'], '1')
['123', '1000']
```

This shows that the function correctly filters out only those strings that have the given prefix. 

The function handles the edge cases of an empty input list or when the prefix is not found in any strings, by returning an empty list or no strings respectively. Therefore, the function is robust and adaptable in various scenarios.  This functionality is useful in many scenarios, such as filtering large datasets by specific subsets or validating user inputs in interactive applications. 

The function's efficient use of the `startswith` method and list comprehension ensures it executes quickly, making it suitable for large lists and real-time applications.  This is essential for maintaining a high-performance standard in the programming field.
