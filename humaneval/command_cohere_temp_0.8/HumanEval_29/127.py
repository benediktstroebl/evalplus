```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a prefix, `prefix`. It returns a new list containing only the strings from the input list that start with the specified prefix. This behavior is achieved using a list comprehension, filtering strings based on the `startswith` method.

The function is self-contained, meaning it does not rely on external assumptions or imported modules other than those explicitly requested. It also has clear and precise type annotations, specifying the expected types of the input arguments and the return value, an essential for creating robust and maintainable code. 

You can use the function in a script or test it immediately with the Python interpreter, as it stands on its own and can be executed independently. 

For example, you can quickly evaluate its behavior by calling the function with specific test cases in the Python interpreter:
```python
>>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
['abc', 'array']
>>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'foo')
[]
>>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], '')
['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array']
```
