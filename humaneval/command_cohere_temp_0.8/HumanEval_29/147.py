```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `List[str]`, containing only the strings from the input list that start with the input prefix. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each string in the input list and checks if it starts with the specified prefix using the `startswith` method. If a string starts with the prefix, it is included in the resulting list. If it does not, it is excluded from the list.  This functionality allows you to filter a list of strings efficiently based on a specific starting prefix. 

The function is designed to be self-contained, meaning it does not rely on any external variables or functions defined outside of its own definition. It is also type-hinted, using the `typing` module, to provide clarity and ensure compatibility with the expected inputs, making it easier to use and maintain in your codebase.  The function's behavior is encapsulated within its own definition, and it doesn't require any external dependencies to function correctly.  It is concise and straightforward, efficiently filtering the list based on the prefix without any unnecessary additional complexity.
