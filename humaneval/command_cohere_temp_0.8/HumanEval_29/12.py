```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [strng for strng in strings if strng.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `return_list`, which contains only the strings from the input list that start with the input prefix. The behavior of the function is explained through its type annotations, comments, and a docstring.

To validate the functionality of the function, here are some test cases in markdown code blocks:
```python
>>> filter_by_prefix([], 'a')
[]
>>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
['abc', 'array']
>>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'ar')
['array']
``` 
And the test cases demonstrate the expected behavior of the function.
