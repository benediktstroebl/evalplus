```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a prefix, `prefix`. It returns a new list containing only the strings from the input list that start with the specified prefix. This is a common operation when you need to filter a list of strings based on a certain condition and is generally considered a useful utility function to have.  The function hint `List[str]` tells us that the function returns a list of strings, and the list comprehension simplifies the logic of filtering. This function can be tested as follows:
```python
# Test case illustrating the usage of the function
assert filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a') == ['abc', 'array']

# Test case with an empty list and a non-empty prefix
assert filter_by_prefix([], 'a') == []

# Test case with a list containing a single element
assert filter_by_prefix(['abc'], 'a') == ['abc']

# Test case with a list containing multiple elements and a matching prefix
assert filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'abd', 'abe', 'abf'], 'ab') == ['abc', 'abd', 'abe', 'abf']
```

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios and can help assure that the function works correctly.  This function is optimized for efficiency because the list comprehension creates a new list object that is only as big as needed - this is an in-place operation and is efficient in terms of memory and performance. It also avoids creating intermediate lists that can waste memory.  This function is self-documenting because its name and parameter names clearly describe its functionality which makes it easy to understand and use without extensive additional documentation.  This function has a uniform interface because the input and output types are consistent with the `List[str]` type hint, which makes it easier to integrate with other parts of an application that may consume or produce similar lists of filtered strings.  It is amenable to parallelization because the filter operation within the list comprehension is trivially parallelizable, and parallel approaches to this function would benefit from distributing the workload across multiple cores or machines. 

This function can be further enhanced with additional features:
1. **Support for Case-Insensitive Filtering**: Currently, the function only matches strings that start with the specified prefix based on the string's lowercase prefix. For case-sensitive filtering, if you want to instead match based on the string's prefix, regardless of case, you can modify the function to use the `lower()` method on the prefix value but leave the string matching behavior unchanged.
```python
def filter_by_prefix_case_insensitive(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.lower().startswith(prefix.lower())]
```
This modified function uses the `lower()` method to convert both the prefix and each string in the list to lowercase before performing the startswith operation, effectively making the filtering case-insensitive. 
2. **Support for Multiple Prefixes**: You could also modify the function to filter strings that contain any of a set of prefixes. 
```python
def filter_by_any_prefix(strings: List[str], prefixes: List[str]) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if any(s.startswith(prefix)
