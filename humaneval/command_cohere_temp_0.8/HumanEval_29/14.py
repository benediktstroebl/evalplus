```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [strng for strng in strings if strng.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `return_list`, which contains only the strings from `strings` that start with the `prefix`. It uses a list comprehension, which is a concise way of expressing a for loop in Python. 

To test this function, you can use the following inputs and expected outputs:
```python
>>> filter_by_prefix([], 'a')
[]
>>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
['abc', 'array']
```

These tests verify that the function correctly filters strings that start with the given prefix.
