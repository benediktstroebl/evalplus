```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [strng for strng in strings if strng.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `return_list`, which contains only the strings from the input list that start with the given prefix. The functionality is illustrated by the following example:
```python
>>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
['abc', 'array']
```

The unit tests for this function can be written as follows:
```python
def test_filter_by_prefix():
    # Empty list, empty prefix
    assert filter_by_prefix([], '') == []

    # List starts with prefix
    assert filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a') == ['abc', 'array']

    # List starts with prefix, ignore case
    assert filter_by_prefix(['ABC', 'bcd', 'cDe', 'arrAy'], 'a') == ['ABC', 'arrAy']

    # List starts with prefix, non-alphabetic characters
    assert filter_by_prefix(['123$@abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a') == ['123$@abc', 'array']

    # Prefix is in the list, but does not start with it
    assert filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'ar') == ['array']

    # List does not start with prefix
    assert filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'f') == []
```

This test suite contains several individual tests to verify the function works as expected. Each test is an assertion that asserts the actual output against the expected output. When the code is run, the tests are automatically checked, and corresponding feedback is shown, for example:
```
....

means that all tests were executed and passed. This provides assurance that the function `filter_by_prefix` works as expected.
