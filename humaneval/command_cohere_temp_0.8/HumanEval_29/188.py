```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `List[str]`, containing only the strings from the input list that start with the input prefix. This behavior is achieved through the use of a list comprehension, which iterates over each string in the input list and creates a new list containing only the strings that start with the specified prefix. 

To test this function, you can call it with various inputs and compare the results to expected outputs. Below is an example of how you can test this function using Python's `unittest` module:
```python
import unittest

class TestFilterByPrefix(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_empty_list(self):
        self.assertEqual(filter_by_prefix([], 'a'), [])

    def test_one_match(self):
        self.assertEqual(filter_by_prefix(['abc'], 'a'), ['abc'])

    def test_multiple_matches(self):
        self.assertEqual(filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'array', 'alpha'], 'a'), ['abc', 'array', 'alpha'])

    def test_no_matches(self):
        self.assertEqual(filter_by_prefix(['bcd', 'cde', 'pie'], 'a'), [])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this test suite, we create a test case for each situation we need to examine, including the scenarios already anticipated in the original problem statement (`test_empty_list`, `test_one_match`, `test_multiple_matches`, and `test_no_matches`). To verify that the output of the `filter_by_prefix` function is as expected, we use the `self.assertEqual()` method. 

To run these tests, you can save the Python script in a file and execute it. The test suite will then run, and any failures or errors will be reported. This provides reassurance that the function continues to operate properly as intended when the code is modified or when other test cases are added in the future.  This approach provides a structured and automated way to ensure that the code behaves as expected and to catch any regressions that may occur during code changes or updates. ）（ Nakhōka arimasuka? ) if you have any questions or need any further assistance.
