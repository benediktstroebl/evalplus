```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [strng for strng in strings if strng.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `List[str]`, that includes only the strings from the input list that start with the input prefix. The function uses a list comprehension, which is a concise way to create lists in Python.

The basic syntax for list comprehension is `[f(x) for x in xs]`, which translates to "Create a new list f(x) for each item x in the list xs". The resulting list will only contain items that match the condition specified in the if statement.

In this case, the list comprehension creates a new list where each element is the result of starting the tracing process from the corresponding item in the input list `strings`. The function then returns the new list where each element is a string that starts with the input prefix.
