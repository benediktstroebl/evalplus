```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [strng for strng in strings if strng.startswith(prefix)]
```

This function takes a list of strings, `strings`, and a string, `prefix`, as input and returns a new list, `List[str]`, containing only the strings from the input list that start with the input prefix. The function utilizes list comprehension to iterate over each string in `strings` and the `startswith` method to check if each string starts with `prefix`. The appropriate strings are included in the new list, which is then returned. 

To ensure the functionality of the program, here is a test-driven development (TDD)-inspired test case that can be used:
```python
def test_filter_by_prefix():
    # Test case: Empty input list
    empty_list = []
    empty_result = filter_by_prefix(empty_list, "a")
    assert empty_result == []

    # Test case: List with one matching string
    one_match = ["abc"]
    one_match_result = filter_by_prefix(one_match, "a")
    assert one_match_result == ["abc"]

    # Test case: List with multiple strings, one matching
    multiples = ["abc", "bcd", "cde", "array"]
    multiples_result = filter_by_prefix(multiples, "a")
    assert multiples_result == ["abc", "array"]

    # Test case: Prefix not in list
    no_match = filter_by_prefix(multiples, "xyz")
    assert no_match == []
```

This test case covers multiple scenarios, including an empty list, a list with one matching string, a list with multiple strings, and a case where the prefix doesn't exist in the list. 

The function is compiled with the test cases into a complete program: 
```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [strng for strng in strings if strng.startswith(prefix)]

def test_filter_by_prefix():
    # Test case: Empty input list
    empty_list = []
    empty_result = filter_by_prefix(empty_list, "a")
    assert empty_result == []

    # Test case: List with one matching string
    one_match = ["abc"]
    one_match_result = filter_by_prefix(one_match, "a")
    assert one_match_result == ["abc"]

    # Test case: List with multiple strings, one matching
    multiples = ["abc", "bcd", "cde", "array"]
    multiples_result = filter_by_prefix(multiples, "a")
    assert multiples_result == ["abc", "array"]

    # Test case: Prefix not in list
    no_match = filter_by_prefix(multiples, "xyz")
    assert no_match == []

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_filter_by_prefix()
```

By including the test cases in the main function, the program ensures that the `filter_by_prefix` function behaves as expected across different scenarios.
