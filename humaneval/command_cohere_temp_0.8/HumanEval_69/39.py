```python
def search(lst):
    freq, max_val = -1, 0 
    for n in lst:
        if n > max_val:
            max_val = n 
        elif n == max_val and lst.count(n) >= n:
            freq = n 
    return max_val if freq == -1 else freq 

# Tests
assert search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) == 2
assert search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) == 3
assert search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) == -1
assert search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == -1
```

This Python script defines a function `search` with a single parameter `lst`, which represents the input list of integers. The function aims to find the greatest integer in the list that meets the conditions: it must be greater than zero, and its frequency (appearance count) in the list must be greater than or equal to its own value. The function employs a loop to analyze each integer in the list, updating the `max_val` and `freq` variables as it goes. The example usage demonstrates the function's behavior with different inputs and shows the asserted results for clarification.
