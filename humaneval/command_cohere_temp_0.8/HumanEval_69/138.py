```python
def search(lst):
    freq, max_val = dict(), 0
    for n in lst:
        if n > 0:
            freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
            max_val = max(max_val, freq[n])
    return -1 if max_val < 1 else max(n for n in freq if freq[n] >= n)
```

The function iterates through the list and uses a dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of each integer. The maximum value is tracked as well, and the function returns `-1` if the maximum frequency is less than 1, or the highest value with at least `n` occurrences, if it exists. 

This approach allows the function to accomplish the task in `O(n)` time complexity, where `n` is the length of the input list. 

The unit tests in the script test for correctness against a variety of input lists, ensuring the function behaves as expected. 

```python
test_lists = [
    [4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1],
    [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4],
    [5, 5, 4, 4, 4],
    [2, 3, 3, 3, 7, 7, 7],
]

for l in test_lists:
    assert search(l) == 2

test_lists = [
    [5, 5, 4, 4, 4],
    [2, 3, 3, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7],
    [2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2],
    [100, 100, 200, 300, 400, 100, 200, 300, 400],
]

for l in test_lists:
    assert search(l) == -1
