```python
def search(lst):
    freq, max_val = dict(), 0
    for n in lst:
        if n <= 0:
            continue
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        max_val = max(max_val, freq[n])
    return -1 if max_val < 1 else max(n for n in freq if freq[n] >= n)
```
The function iterates through the list and uses a dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of each integer. The maximum value is tracked on each iteration, ensuring it is updated whenever a new frequency is found. Finally, the function returns -1 if no positive integer is found with a frequency >= itself, or returns the maximum such integer. 

Here is a simple test case for the provided code:
```python
def test_search():
    assert search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) == 2
    assert search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) == 3
    assert search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) == -1
    assert search([0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]) == -1
test_search()
```
This test case checks the function with different lists, ensuring it returns the correct result. 

Let me know if you would like me to explain any part of the solution or provide additional tests to ensure its robustness!
