```python
def search(lst):
    freq, max_val = 0, max(lst)
    for n in lst:
        if n >= freq:
            freq = n
        if n > max_val: 
            max_val = n
    return -1 if max_val == freq and max_val == 0 else max_val
```

The function iterates through the list, tracking the maximum value of the list (`max_val`) and the frequency of each integer in the list (`freq`). If the frequency of an integer is greater than or equal to its value, we return this integer `max_val`, assuming it's the greatest integer that satisfies the problem's condition. If no such integer exists in the list, the function returns -1. This approach ensures that it correctly identifies the greatest integer that fulfills the condition and returns -1 when no such integer exists. 

The previous approach's complexity was `O(n^2)`, with a space complexity of `O(n)`, owing to the maximum value tracking. This version is more space efficient as it only iterates through the list once and doesn't require an additional list to store the frequencies.
