```python
def search(lst):
    freq, max_val = dict(), 0
    for n in lst:
        if n <= 0:
            continue
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        max_val = max(max_val, freq[n])
    return -1 if max_val < 1 else max(n for n in freq if freq[n] >= n)
```
The solution employs a dictionary (`freq`) to record the frequency of each integer in the list. Initially, the `max_val` variable is set to the value of the first integer in the list, or zero if the list is empty. Then, it iterates through the list, updating the frequency value of each integer and concurrently updating `max_val` to the maximum value between itself and the frequency of the current integer. Finally, the function returns -1 if `max_val` is less than 1, implying there are no positive integers with a frequency greater than or equal to itself. Otherwise, it returns the maximum value of the positive integers that satisfy this condition.
