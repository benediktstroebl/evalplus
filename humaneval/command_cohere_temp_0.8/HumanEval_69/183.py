```python
def search(lst):
    freq, max_val = dict(), 0
    for n in lst:
        if n > 0:
            freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
            max_val = max(max_val, freq[n])
    return -1 if max_val < 1 else max(n for n in freq if freq[n] >= n)
```
The `search` function takes a list of positive integers `lst` as input. It initializes a dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of each integer in the list and a variable `max_val` to store the maximum value found so far (greater than zero) with a frequency equal to or greater than itself.

The loop iterates through each integer in the list. If the integer is greater than zero, its frequency is updated in the `freq` dictionary. The `max_val` variable is updated with the maximum value found so far, ensuring that the frequency of the current maximum value is equal to or greater than itself.

After processing all integers, the function returns -1 if `max_val` is less than 1, indicating that no valid integer was found. Otherwise, it iterates through the keys of the `freq` dictionary and returns the maximum integer that has a frequency equal to or greater than itself.

The code successfully solves the problem statement and returns the greatest integer that is greater than zero and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. If no such integer is found, it returns -1.
