```python
def search(lst):
    freq, max_val = dict(), 0
    for n in lst:
        if n > 0:
            freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
            max_val = max(max_val, freq[n])
    return -1 if max_val < 1 else max(n for n in freq if freq[n] >= n)
```
The `search` function takes a list of positive integers `lst` as input. It initializes a dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of each integer in the list and a variable `max_val` to keep track of the maximum frequency encountered. It then iterates through the list, updating the frequency of each integer and recalculating `max_val` as necessary. 

After processing the list, the function checks if the maximum frequency is less than 1. If so, no integer in the list satisfies the condition, and it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the highest integer that meets the requirement by iterating over the keys of the `freq` dictionary and returning the maximum integer with a frequency greater than or equal to itself.
