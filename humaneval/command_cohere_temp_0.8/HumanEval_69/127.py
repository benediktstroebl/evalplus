```python
def search(lst):
    freq, max_val = 0, max(lst)
    for n in lst:
        if n >= freq:
            freq = n
        if n > max_val:
            max_val = n
    return -1 if max_val == freq and max_val == 0 else max_val
```

The function `search` iterates through the list, keeping track of the maximum value while also counting the frequency of each number. If a number is greater than or equal to its frequency, it's updated in the respective variables. The final maximum value is returned if it's greater than zero and tied with its frequency, as dictated by the problem's criteria, hence the -1 return value for the last test case. 

Here is some additional scaffolding to host the function and demonstrate it through tests:
```python
import unittest

class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_search(self):
        self.assertEqual(search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]), 2)
        self.assertEqual(search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]), 3)
        self.assertEqual(search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]), -1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Running this test file using `python -m unittest test.py` will execute the tests and show the respective pass/fail status.
