```python
def search(lst):
    freq, max_val = 0, max(lst)
    for n in lst:
        if n >= freq:
            freq = n
        if n > max_val: 
            max_val = n
    return -1 if max_val == freq and max_val == 0 else max_val
```
The function iterates through the list, keeping track of the variable `freq`, which records the frequency of the current integer, and `max_val`, which is gradually updated to the maximum value in the list. If a number is greater than or equal to its frequency, `freq` is updated accordingly. 

If the algorithm has progressed all the way through the list without identifying a number that satisfies the problem's criteria, the max_val == freq condition is used to determine whether the maximum value is equal to its frequency, and the base case of max_val == 0 is used to return -1. If a suitable number is discovered during the loop, it is returned. 

This approach is efficient because it takes advantage of the list's linear structure, and the variables `freq` and `max_val` enable efficient frequency and maximum value tracking, respectively.
