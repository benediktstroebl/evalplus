```python
def search(lst):
    freq, max_val = dict(), 0
    for n in lst:
        if n <= 0:
            continue
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        max_val = max(max_val, freq[n])
    return -1 if max_val < 1 else max(max_val, max(lst))
```

The function `search` uses a dictionary `freq` to count the frequency of each integer in the list. Then, it determines the maximum value of the frequency of all list integers (`max_val`) at the start of the iteration to ensure the maximum is found. Subsequently, it checks if there is no element in the list whose frequency is greater than or equal to its value, it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns either the maximum frequency value or the maximum value in the list, ensuring the answer is greater than zero.
