```python
def search(lst):
    freq, max_val = -1, 0
    for n in lst:
        if n > 0:
            max_val = max(max_val, n)
            freq = lst.count(n)
        if freq >= n:
            return n
        if freq > max_val:
            max_val, freq = max_val, freq
    return -1
```

This script defines a function `search` which uses a list of integers `lst` as input. It calculates the frequency of each number in the list and iterates through each element to determine if it meets the criteria of the problem. 

The script returns the largest integer `n` that satisfies the condition `n >= freq`, or returns `-1` if no such integer exists. 

The output is capped at the largest value in the list at the beginning of the loop, ensuring that it will never attempt to calculate a frequency of an empty set. This improves the efficiency and guarantees that the largest integer that satisfies the condition is returned, making the correctness proof easier.
