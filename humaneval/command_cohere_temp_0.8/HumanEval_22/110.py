```python
from typing import List, Any

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Filter given list of any Python values only for integers.
    """
    result = [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]
    return result
```

The above code assumes the presence of a module-level `values` list and a function `filter_integers` with a docstring description that appears after the function declaration. The function takes a list of items, and returns a list containing only the integer values from the input list. It does so by using a list comprehension that checks if each item in the input list is an instance of the `int` class, and assigns them to the `result` list. The output List is returned after the function. 

To ensure proper handling of non-integer types, the function uses Python's `isinstance()` function to check if each item in the list is an integer. This way, it can exclude elements of other types, such as strings, floats, dictionaries, and lists. 

To run the code successfully, make sure to have a `values` list at the module level. You can do this by adding it above the function declaration:
```python
values = [1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []]
```

This will allow you to test the `filter_integers` function with the following calls:
```python
print(filter_integers(values))
```
```bash
[1, 2, 3]
```

A more compact way of testing the function is by using the following code:
```python
print(filter_integers([1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []]))
```
```bash
[1, 2, 3]
```

This way, you can verify that the function correctly filters out integers from the given list.  If you run this code, it will print `[1, 2, 3]` as the output, indicating that only the integer values (1, 2, and 3) were filtered from the input list.
