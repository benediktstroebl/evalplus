```python
from typing import List

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]
    return result
```

The above code provides a function to filter out integers from a list of values of any type. As argued earlier, using `isinstance()` is both simpler and safer and allows us to stick to the `Type Hint` of the function, which is `List[int]`. 

The function uses a list comprehension to filter out only the integers from the input list. The resulting list only contains elements that are of the integer type.
