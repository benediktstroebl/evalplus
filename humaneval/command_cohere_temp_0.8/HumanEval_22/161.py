```python
from typing import List, Any

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Filter given list of any Python values only for integers.
    """
    result = [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]
    return result
```

The above code snippet takes a list of values of any type and returns a list of integers present in the input list. It utilizes the list comprehension technique to filter out non-integer elements efficiently. 

To ensure robustness for edge cases, unit tests can be added to verify the function's behavior. For example:
```python
def test_filter_integers():
    # Test case 1
    values = ['a', 3.14, 5]
    expected = [5]
    assert filter_integers(values) == expected

    # Test case 2
    values = [1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []]
    expected = [1, 2, 3]
    assert filter_integers(values) == expected

    # Test case 3
    values = [0, 5, 6, 7, 'foo', 'bar']
    expected = [0, 5, 6, 7]
    assert filter_integers(values) == expected
``` 

These tests cover a variety of scenarios, including numeric and non-numeric values, ensuring that the `filter_integers` function behaves as expected. 
However, if you intend to import this function in another script, it is advisable to handle empty input differently, such as simply returning an empty list `[]` instead of raising an error. This approach aligns with Python's "It's easier to return None than to raise an exception" philosophy. 

If you want to raise an exception, consider using `if values:` to check for empty input lists explicitly, and raise a customized exception, such as `ValueError` if an empty list is supplied.  This will provide clearer feedback to users or developers who might use your function and encounter such exceptional cases.
