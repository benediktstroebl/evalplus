```python
from typing import List

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]
    return result
```

The above code provides an improved version to handle the filtering of integers. It employs a list comprehension to iterate through the input list values and filter out elements based on the condition `isinstance(x, int)`. This allows the function to discern whether each element is an integer or not, thereby ensuring that only integers are retained in the resultant list.

The function then returns this filtered list, providing a clear and concise way to obtain a list of integers from the original input list.
