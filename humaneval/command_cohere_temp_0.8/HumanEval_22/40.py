```python
from typing import List, Any

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Filter given list of any Python values only for integers.
    """
    int_values = [val for val in values if isinstance(val, int)]
    return int_values
```

The function uses a list comprehension that checks if each value `val` in the input list `values` is an instance of the `int` type using the `isinstance()` function. If it is an integer, it is included in the `int_values` list, which is returned at the end of the function.

This solution should achieve the functionality described in the original problem statement and pass the tests provided. Let me know if you'd like to expand or adjust the unit tests to further validate this solution.
