```python
from typing import List

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Filter given list of any Python values only for integers.
    """
    return [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]
```

The above code assumes the given test cases in the problem description, where the function `filter_integers` is tested with lists of varying elements containing integers and other types, producing the expected filtered lists of integers. 
If you were to amend the question with specific test cases, I can amend the response accordingly. Let me know if you have any further questions!
