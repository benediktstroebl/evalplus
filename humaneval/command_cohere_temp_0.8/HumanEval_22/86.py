```python
from typing import List, Any

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Filter given list of any Python values only for integers.
    """
    return [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]
```

The above code assumes that the list could contain any type of values including integers, floats, strings, or even nested objects. The `filter_integers()` function then creates a new list with only the integers included from the provided list of values, using a list comprehension with a condition checking if each item `x` in the list is an instance of the integer type.

To run the code, you can save it as a `.py` file and execute the file in your terminal using python, and you should see the returned list of integers. 

To run the tests, you can use Python's built-in `unittest` module. The tests are defined using the `assert` statement, which checks if the actual output matches the expected output for the given input.
