```python
from typing import List

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Filter given list of any Python values only for integers.
    """
    return [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]
```

The function uses a list comprehension, which is a concise way to create a new list based on existing lists, to filter out non-integer items from the input list. It iterates over each item in the input list and creates a new list with only the integer values. The comment at the top of the code explains the purpose of the function and provides example test cases that demonstrate how it works. 

This solution is concise and efficient in filtering integers from a list of various data types in Python.
