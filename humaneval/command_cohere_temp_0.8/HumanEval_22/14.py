```python
from typing import List, Optional

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Filter given list of any Python values only for integers.

    :param values: List of any Python values.
    :return: List of integers contained in the input list.
    """
    integers: List[int] = []
    for value in values:
        if isinstance(value, int):
            integers.append(value)
    return integers
```

The function `filter_integers` takes a list of values as input and returns a list of integers present in the input list. It achieves this by iterating through each value in the input list using a for loop. For each value, it checks if the value is an instance of the integer class using the `isinstance()` function. If true, it includes the value in the `integers` list and finally returns this list. 

This approach ensures that only actual integers are included in the resulting list, as specified by the problem statement.

The function includes a docstring that describes its purpose, input, and output for better readability and maintainability. 

This solution has a minimum number of dependencies and uses type annotations to provide more information about the expected input type and the return type. 

It is a concise and efficient solution that is easy to read and does not require any additional libraries. 
The tests demonstrate the correct behavior of the function with different input scenarios.  it would look something like this:
```python
def test_filter_integers():
    # Test case 1
    input_list = ['a', 3.14, 5, 'bb', 6, 'xx']
    expected_result = [5, 6]
    result = filter_integers(input_list)
    assert result == expected_result

    # Test case 2
    input_list = [1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, [], []]
    expected_result = [1, 2, 3]
    result = filter_integers(input_list)
    assert result == expected_result

    # Test case 3
    input_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
    expected_result = list(range(10, 101))
    result = filter_integers(input_list)
    assert result == expected_result
```
