```python
from typing import List, Optional

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Filter given list of any Python values only for integers.

    :param values: List of any Python values.
    :return: List of integers contained in the input list.
    """
    result: List[int] = []
    for value in values:
        if isinstance(value, int):
            result.append(value)
    return result
```

The function `filter_integers` takes a list of values as input and returns a list of integers contained in the input list. The function checks if each value in the list is an instance of the integer class using the `isinstance` function. And since Markdown doesn't support nested code blocks, the function header and the comment are added to provide clarity regarding the function's purpose. To preserve simplicity, the comprehensive error handling and the specifications were not included in this code snippet.
