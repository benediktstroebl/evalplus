```python
from typing import List, Any

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]
    return result
```

The above code directly uses a list comprehension to produce a list of integers from the input list `values`. The expression `isinstance(x, int)` is used to determine if each element `x` in the `values` list is an instance of the `int` class, which indicates that it is an integer value, and if so, includes it in the `result` list. 

Here is a simple test case to test the above function:
```python
def test_filter_integers():
    # Arrange
    test_values = [1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []]

    # Act
    result = filter_integers(test_values)

    # Assert
    assert result == [1, 2, 3]
``` 

The function passes this test case because the list `[1, 2, 3]` contains only integers, and the other non-integer elements are filtered out. 

This approach follows the [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-20/#zen-of-python) philosophy of "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication," as it uses a simple and straightforward list comprehension to achieve the desired result.
