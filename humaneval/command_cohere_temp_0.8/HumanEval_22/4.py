```python
from typing import List

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Filter given list of any Python values only for integers.
    """
    result = [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]
    return result
```

The above code assumes that you want to filter a list of values down to just the integers. The `filter_integers` function takes a list of values as an argument and returns a new list that only includes integers. This is a common task in programming, especially when dealing with data cleaning or transformation. 

To test this, we can call the function with various inputs to demonstrate its behaviour:
```python
>>> filter_integers(['a', 3.14, 5])
[5]
>>> filter_integers([1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []])
[1, 2, 3]
```

This should return the expected output as outlined in the problem statement. 

If you need any adjustments to be made to the code, feel free to let me know!
