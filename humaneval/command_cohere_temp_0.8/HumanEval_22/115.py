```python
from typing import List

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `filter_integers` that takes a list of values of any type specified in the type annotation `List[Any]` and returns a list of integers. The function utilizes a list comprehension to iterate through each value in the input list, and checks if each value is an instance of the int class, which denotes an integer value. If it is, the value is included in the resultant list. The function then returns this list, containing only the integer values from the input list. 

To ensure the functionality of the `filter_integers` function, it is important to establish comprehensive test cases that cover a variety of scenarios. The following are two such test cases:
```python
def test_filter_integers():
    # Test case 1: Input list contains a mixture of values, including integers and non-integers
    values = ['apple', 2, 'orange', 5, 'banana', 7, 'grape']
    expected_result = [2, 5, 7]
    result = filter_integers(values)
    assert result == expected_result

    # Test case 2: Input list contains only integers
    values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    expected_result = values
    result = filter_integers(values)
    assert result == expected_result
```

These tests verify that the function correctly filters out only the integer values from the input list, regardless of whether the list contains a mixture of different value types or is comprised entirely of integers. 
However, it's worth noting that the function as provided in the initial reply is not correct, as it does not account for any edge cases such as empty lists or lists containing only non-integer values. Adding edge case analysis and covering the cases where the list is empty, list contains only non-integer values, and list mixed with integers and non-integer would provide a more comprehensive test suite.
