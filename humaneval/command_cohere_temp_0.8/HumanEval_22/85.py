```python
from typing import List

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `filter_integers` that takes a list of values of any type specified in the type hint `List[Any]` and returns a list of integers. The function utilizes a list comprehension to iterate through each value in the input list, and checks if the value is an instance of the int class, which denotes an integer value. If it is, the value is included in the resultant list. The function then returns this list, containing only the integer values from the input list. 

To ensure the functionality of the `filter_integers` function, it is essential to incorporate comprehensive testing. Traditionally, testing in Python involves the utilization of a testing framework like `unittest` or `pytest`. Nevertheless, due to the limited context and the requirement for a self-contained script, it is more appropriate to adopt a simplified testing approach.

For this scenario, I will utilize a rudimentary strategy to test the function's behavior against diverse inputs and expected outputs. Here's how we can test the function:
```python
# Test Case 1
values = ['a', 3.14, 5]
expected_result = [5]

# Test Case 2
values = [1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []]
expected_result = [1, 2, 3]

# Test the function with different inputs and expected outputs
assert filter_integers(values) == expected_result
```

In the test code, we have two different test scenarios `Test Case 1` and `Test Case 2` that are executed. Each test scenario consists of the input `values` and the expected `result` computed with the `filter_integers` function. Using the `assert` statement, we can compare the actual result of the function when invoked with the `values` against the expected `result`.

Please note that this testing approach is suited for simplicity in this context, but for more complex scenarios, it is recommended to use dedicated testing frameworks like `unittest` or `pytest` to create more robust test cases and organize them in a more structured manner. 
If you want to have a more comprehensive test suite, the aforementioned testing frameworks can be incorporated to design more advanced test cases, including edge scenarios and scenarios where the input list contains special integers such as `None` or `NaN`.
