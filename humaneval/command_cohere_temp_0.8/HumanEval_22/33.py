```python
from typing import List

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Filter given list of any Python values only for integers.
    """
    result = [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]
    return result
```

The above code directly addresses the problem statement by filtering `List[Any]` for elements that are instances of int using a list comprehension and the `isinstance()` function. It is also typed, making it more robust against potential issues and easier to understand.
