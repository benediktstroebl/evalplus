```python
from typing import List, Any

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Filter given list of any Python values only for integers.
    """
    result = [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]
    return result
```

The above code assumes that you want to filter a list of values down to just the integers. The `filter_integers` function takes in a list of values of any type and returns a list of integers. It works by using a list comprehension that checks if each value in the input list is an instance of the `int` class, and if so, includes it in the result list. Finally, it returns the result list, which contains only the integers from the input list.  This way, the function ensures that only integers are retained from the input list, and any non-integer values are excluded.  It is also typed, making it more readable and allowing tools to help enforce the correctness of the code.
