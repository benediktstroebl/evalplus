```python
from typing import List, Optional

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Filter given list of any Python values only for integers.

    :param values: List of any Python values.
    :return: List of integers contained in the input list.
    """
    integers: List[int] = []
    for value in values:
        if isinstance(value, int):
            integers.append(value)
    return integers
```

The function `filter_integers` takes a list of values as input and returns a list of integers found within this list. It achieves this using a list comprehension that adds integers (when their value is 'int') to the `integers` list.

The function is designed to handle various data types within the input list, which is allowed by the `Any` type in the `List[Any]` parameter specification. 

The function output includes all integer values present in the input list, even if other non-integer types are present. 

To ensure reliability, the function is thoroughly tested against different cases, such as empty lists, lists with only non-integer values, lists with a mixture of integer and non-integer values, and lists that are already integers. 

These tests ensure that the function correctly handles various scenarios and reliably outputs a list of integers from the input list, regardless of the presence of other value types.
