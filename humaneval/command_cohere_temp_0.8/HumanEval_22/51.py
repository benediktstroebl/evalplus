```python
from typing import List

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `filter_integers` that takes a list of values of any type specified in the type hint `List[Any]` and returns a list of integers. The function utilizes a list comprehension to iterate through each value in the input list, and checks if the value is an instance of the integer class `isinstance(x, int)`. If it is, the value is included in the resultant list. The function then returns the list of integers.

To properly test this function, we need to check that it correctly filters out non-integer values from a variety of input lists and only returns integers. We can use the `assert` statement to check that the output of the function for a specific input list is equal to the expected output.

Here is an example of how to test this function:
```python
def test_filter_integers():
    # List with only integers
    values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    expected = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    result = filter_integers(values)
    assert result == expected

    # List with integers and non-integer values
    values = [1, 2, 3, "abc", 4, 5.0]
    expected = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    result = filter_integers(values)
    assert result == expected

    # List with only non-integer values
    values = ["a", "b", "c", [], {}]
    expected = []
    result = filter_integers(values)
    assert result == expected
```

This test suite covers multiple scenarios, ensuring that the `filter_integers` function works correctly for different input lists. Specifically, it checks the functionality against three distinct cases:
1. A list comprising only integers, where the expected output is the same as the input.
2. A list containing a mix of integers and non-integer values, guaranteeing that only the former are retained.
3. A list consisting solely of non-integer values, indicating an empty output. 

By employing the `assert` statement to compare the function's output against the expected values, we can verify the function's proper operation. If the inputs and expected outputs are appropriately defined, the test suite provides a robust mechanism to validate the function's behavior.
