```python
from typing import List, Any

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Filter given list of any Python values only for integers.
    """
    integers = [val for val in values if isinstance(val, int)]
    return integers
```

The function calls upon a list comprehension that loops through each value in the input list (`values`). It checks if each individual value `val` is an instance of the `int` class, using the `isinstance()` function. If this condition is met, `val` is included in the `integers` list. The function then returns the `integers` list, which contains only the integer values from the input list. 

This approach ensures that any non-integer values in the input list are ignored and only the integer values are filtered and returned. 

To validate the functionality of the function, you can use the following tests:
```python
def test_filter_integers():
    # Positive test cases
    assert filter_integers([1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []]) == [1, 2, 3]
    assert filter_integers([3, 9, 'abc', 10.0, '', []]) == [3, 9, 10]

    # Edge case: Empty list
    assert filter_integers([]) == []

    # Negative test case: List with only non-integer values
    assert filter_integers([1, 'abc', 10.0, [], ()]) == []
```

To test the function, you can use a variety of input lists and verify that the output contains only the expected integer values, while any non-integer values are filtered out.  This way, you can confidently assert that the function behaves as designed, across a variety of scenarios.  If you encounter any unexpected behavior, it indicates a coding error or a potential bug, pointing you toward avenues for further improvement.
