```python
from typing import List

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `filter_integers` that takes a list of values of any type specified in the type hint `List[Any]` and returns a list of integers. The function utilizes a list comprehension to iterate through each value in the input list, and checks if each value is an instance of the int class, which denotes an integer value. If it is, the value is included in the resultant list. The function then returns this filtered list of integers.

To properly utilize the `filter_integers` function and demonstrate its functionality, it is typically employed with illustrative test cases. When the function is invoked with a test case of `[1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []]`, it yields `[1, 2, 3]`, showcasing its ability to extract integer elements from an input list comprising various data types.

The code snippet employs type hints, which enhance code readability and maintainability. These hints provide information about the expected types of parameters and return values in the function signature, enabling developers to create appropriate inputs and understand the output. 

In addition, the function includes a docstring, a string literal that serves as an explanation and documentation for the function. The docstring conveys the purpose of the function, the values it accepts, and the type of values it returns. It also provides example usage of the function with detailed output expectations. These examples are enclosed in triple quotes (`'"""`) to create code blocks in the docstring that illustrate the function's behavior when utilizing different input values.
