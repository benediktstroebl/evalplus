```python
from typing import List

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]
    return result
```

The above code provides a function to filter out integers from a list of values of any type. 

The function uses a list comprehension to check if each element in the input list is an instance of the int class, and then returns a new list that only includes the elements that passed this check. 

This solution adheres to the type hinting feature available in Python since version 3.8 through the "typing" module and allows better handling of variable types. 

The function returns a list of integers if any are found in the input list, or an empty list if no integers are present. 

The previous code is a solution to the problem in a self-contained Python script, as you requested.
