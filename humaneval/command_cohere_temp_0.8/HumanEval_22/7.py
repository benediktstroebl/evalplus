```python
from typing import List, Optional

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Filter given list of any Python values only for integers.
    """
    result: List[int] = []
    for value in values:
        if isinstance(value, int):
            result.append(value)
    return result
```

The function `filter_integers` takes a list of values of any type and returns a list of integers by filtering out values that are not of type `int`. It uses **typing** for stronger type-checking and includes a docstring for developer guidance. The function is designed to be efficient and does not require any additional modules. 

To ensure the accuracy of the function, test cases should be added to verify its performance. Below is a markdown code block with example usage and tests to verify the correctness of the `filter_integers` function:
```python
"""
Example Usage:
>>> filter_integers(['a', 3.14, 5])
[5]
>>> filter_integers([1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []])
[1, 2, 3]
"""

#. Testing with a sample list of values
Test Case | Result | Comment
---|---|---
[1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []] | [1, 2, 3] | Expected result is a list containing only integers
[1, 2, '3', 4, 'five'] | [1, 2, 4] | Values are filtered based on the type int
[False, True, None, '', 'abc', 0, 5, 6.78] | [0, 5] | Handles different types of values and values with zero

#. Edge Cases
Test Case | Result | Comment
---|---|---
[ ], [] | [] | Empty input list should return empty output list
None | [] | Handling None input
```

These test cases cover different scenarios that the `filter_integers` function should handle properly. By running these tests, we can confirm that the function works as expected and provides the correct output for a variety of input scenarios.  Any of these test cases can be executed by modifying them in the markdown code block and running them in the Python environment.
