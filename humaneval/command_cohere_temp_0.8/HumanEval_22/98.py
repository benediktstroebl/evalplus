```python
from typing import List

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Filter given list of any Python values only for integers.
    """
    int_list = [item for item in values if isinstance(item, int)]
    return int_list
```

This function uses a list comprehension, which is a powerful Python technique, to filter out items that are not of type integer. The condition `isinstance(item, int)` checks if each item in the list is an integer, and filters out the ones that are.

The function returns a list of integers if there are any in the input list, or an empty list if the input list does not contain any integers. You can test this function by calling it with different input lists and verifying that it returns the expected results. Adding tests to the code snippet below can also help ensure that the function continues to work correctly in the future:
```python
import unittest

class TestFilterIntegers(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_filter_correct_types(self):
        self.assertEqual(filter_integers([1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []]), [1, 2, 3])

    def test_filter_only_strings(self):
        self.assertEqual(filter_integers(['a', 'b', 'c']), [])

    def test_empty_list(self):
        self.assertEqual(filter_integers([]), [])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
``` 

This will ensure that the function stays valid in the future, maintaining its responsiveness to changes in the code or dependencies, and saving you from potential issues caused by unintended side effects.  By executing this test suite you can verify that the function behaves as expected with different test cases.
