```python
from typing import List

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]
    return result
```

The above code provides an improved solution. The function `filter_integers` accepts a list of various Python values and returns a list that contains only the integers. It utilizes a list comprehension that iterates through each element `x` in the input `values` list. For each element, it checks if the element `x` is an instance of the `int` class using the `isinstance()` function. If this condition is met, the element `x` is included in the `result` list. The function then returns the `result` list, which contains only the integers from the input list. 

This solution is more concise and retains the functionality of the provided solution while avoiding the use of a lambda function and shortening the lines using multi-line statements.
