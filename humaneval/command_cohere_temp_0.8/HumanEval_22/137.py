```python
from typing import List

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]
    return result
```

The above code directly uses a list comprehension to produce a list of integers from the input list. 

To perform the check if a element is an integer, the `isinstance()` function is used, which determines the type of the elements in each iteration and filters out elements based on the specified type, which in this case is `int`. 

Please note, that this `filter_integers` function works identical to the function described in the original markdown code block, but the comments in the code block explicitly describe the purpose of the function and guide the user to understand its functionality and logic, which is aligned with the best practices. 

The resulting list `result` only includes elements that are of int type.
