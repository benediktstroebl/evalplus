```python
from typing import List

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Filter given list of any Python values only for integers.
    """
    return [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]
```

The above code directly addresses the problem statement by filtering `List[Any]` for elements that are instances of int using a list comprehension and the `isinstance()` function.

To validate the functionality of the function, you can add test cases as command-line inputs using doctest semantics like I've done below:
```python
>>> filter_integers(['a', 3.14, 5])
[5]
>>> filter_integers([1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []])
[1, 2, 3]
```

These test cases were inspired by the ones you provided in the original problem statement. 
If they pass, it verifies that the function behaves as expected. 
This is a valuable practice as it ensures that the function remains correct with changes in its downstream environment or dependencies. 
It's a good practice to have tests for your functions, especially if they are standalone like this one. 
It not only helps you validate your own work but is also helpful to have a safety net as your codebase evolves over time. 
It's like an insurance policy for your code. 
If you add more tests, make sure to keep this function unchanged so that it passes all the tests. Gives you a clear picture of how this function is used and what values it can handle, which is helpful for debugging and updating. 
If we decide to change it, we do it with full awareness and confidence in the new design because we have tests to verify it. 
Hope this helps! Let me know if you need anything else.
