```python
from typing import List

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Filter given list of any Python values only for integers.
    """
    return [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]
```

The above code directly addresses the problem statement by filtering `List[Any]` for elements that are instances of int using a list comprehension and the `isinstance()` function.

To validate the functionality of the `filter_integers()` function, I added test cases that roughly mirror the ones from the markdown code block you provided:
```python
def test_filter_integers():
    # Test case 1
    assert filter_integers(['a', 3.14, 5]) == [5]

    # Test case 2
    assert filter_integers([1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []]) == [1, 2, 3]

    # Edge case: Empty list
    assert filter_integers([]) == []

    # Edge case: List with only integers
    assert filter_integers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    # Edge case: List with only non-integer elements
    assert filter_integers([ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']) == []

test_filter_integers()
```

By running this test suite, you can verify that the function behaves as expected across different scenarios. 

This solution is efficient and should work well for lists with a large number of elements, ensuring that only the integer elements are retained. If you would like to test the functionality on a large list of random integers and values, you can try using a module like `faker` to generate randomized test data. 

Let me know if you'd like me to integrate such tests or improve the robustness of the solution in any way!
