```python
from typing import List

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]
    return result
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `filter_integers` that takes a list of values of any type specified in the type annotation `List[Any]` and returns a list of integers. The function utilizes a list comprehension to iterate through each value in the input list, and checks if each value is an instance of the int class, which denotes an integer value. Only those values that are integers are included in the `result` list, all other values are excluded. The returned list of integers is then returned as the output. 

In essence, the function filters out and returns a list containing only the integer values from the given input list, regardless of the original order or if other non-integer types are included. 

This approach allows the function to effectively separate the intended data from the rest, providing a filtered list of integers ready for further processing or analysis. 
The function docs include useful examples that help to understand its usage. Also, the function can be additionally modified to meet other specific criteria and is adaptable to diverse scenarios. In terms of performance, this approach is efficient because it creates a new list result from the filtered values, but it does not modify the original list values, providing an efficient and safe mechanism for filtering data while preserving the integrity of the input list.
