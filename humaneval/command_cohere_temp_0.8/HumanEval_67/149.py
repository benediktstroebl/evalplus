```python
def fruit_distribution(s,n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split(' and '))
    return n - apples - oranges
```

This Python script provides a function called `fruit_distribution` operates on two parameters: a string `s` and an integer `n`. This function is designed to solve the problem statement presented in the question. It does so by parsing the string `s` to extract the counts of apples and oranges from the text format, using Python's native `int` type to convert the parsed counts, and then calculates the missing fruit count by subtracting the sums of apples and oranges from the total count `n`. This provides a clear and concise way to implement the given task's solution.
