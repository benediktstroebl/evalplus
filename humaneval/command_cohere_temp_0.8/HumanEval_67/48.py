```python
def fruit_distribution(s,n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split(' and '))
    return n - apples - oranges
```

This problem can be solved by splitting the input string into two integers that represent the number of apples and oranges. The function then returns the total number of fruits in the basket minus the number of apples and oranges. A test suite could be created to test various scenarios of inputs to ensure the function returns the expected output. Here is an example:
```python
def test_fruit_distribution():
    # Example 1
    assert fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19) == 8
    # Example 2
    assert fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges", 3) == 2
    # Example 3
    assert fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100) == 95
    # Example 4
    assert fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges", 120) == 19
``` 

This would ensure that the function `fruit_distribution` performs as expected.
