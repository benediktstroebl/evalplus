# TEST CASES
def test_fruit_distribution():
    assert fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19) == 8
    assert fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges", 3) == 2
    assert fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100) == 95
    assert fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges", 120) == 19
```

This code defines a function `fruit_distribution` that solves the problem as stated in the prompt. It uses `int` to convert the string representations of the numbers of apples and oranges into integer values and then subtracts these values from the total number of fruits to find the number of mango fruits. The `test_fruit_distribution` function provides test cases to verify the correctness of the `fruit_distribution` function. You can run these test cases to confirm that the function behaves as expected.
