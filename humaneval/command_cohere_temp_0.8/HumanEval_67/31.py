```python
def fruit_distribution(s,n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split(' and '))
    return n - apples - oranges
```

This Python script provides a function called `fruit_distribution` operationally designed to solve the problem statement. It takes two parameters, a string `s` and an integer `n`. The string `s` is presumed to be structured in the format "`number of apples` and `number of oranges`", and the integer `n` is supposed to represent the total number of fruits in the basket. 

The function splits the string into two integers, `apples` and `oranges`, using the "and" delimiter. These are presumed to represent the number of apples and oranges, respectively, in the basket. The function then returns the difference between the total number of fruits in the basket, `n`, and the sum of apples and oranges, thereby providing the number of mangoes in the basket.

The function is self-contained, meaning it does not rely on any external variables or functions within the provided code block. It is designed to be standalone and fully functional to solve the problem statement without any external dependencies.  It is also concise, implementing a clear and simple algorithm to compute the number of mangoes with a manageable code size and clear code structure. 

This code can be executed directly in any Python environment and is also readily integratable into larger frameworks or programs as a modular component without any modifications.
