    return n - apples - oranges

# TEST CASES
def test_fruit_distribution():
    assert fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19) == 8
    assert fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges", 3) == 2
    assert fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100) == 95
    assert fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges", 120) == 19
```
This code defines a function `fruit_distribution` that solves the problem as stated in the prompt. It dynamically extracts the number of apples and oranges from the input string, calculates the total number of mangoes using the given formula, and returns the result. 

The code also includes test cases to validate the behavior of the `fruit_distribution` function. Using the `assert` statement, these test cases verify that the function produces the proper outcomes for a variety of inputs.

Make sure to install the cohere-python-client library to run the code:
```
pip install cohere-python-client

The code is self-contained and does not rely on any external variables or dependencies, and it can be executed as a standalone Python script.
