```python
def fruit_distribution(s,n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split(' and '))
    return n - apples - oranges
```

The code solves the problem by taking the input string s that represents the number of apples and oranges and splits it into an integer array of apples and oranges using the 'and' delimiter. Then, the function subtracts the sum of the apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket (n) to return the number of mangoes in the basket.

Here is a test case to try it out:
```python
print(fruit_distribution("7 apples and 8 oranges", 24))
```
Which should output:
```bash
9
```

And here is a more exhaustive test case to verify the edge cases of the code:
```python
print(fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges",3))
print(fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100))
print(fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges",120))
print(fruit_distribution("7 apples and 8 oranges", 24))
```
Which will output:
```bash
2
95
19
9
```

This set of test cases should verify the functionality of the `fruit_distribution` function. If any of the test cases fail, it indicates a bug in the code that needs to be addressed.
