```python
def fruit_distribution(s,n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split(' and '))
    return n - apples - oranges
```

The code defines a function `fruit_distribution` that takes two parameters: a string `s` and an integer `n`. The string `s` represents the number of apples and oranges in the basket, and the integer `n` represents the total number of fruits in the basket. 

The solution splits the string into an array of apples and oranges using the `split` method and the string " and ". The code then returns the number of mangoes by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket `n`.

Here is a test case to test the code:
```python
test_case = dict(s = "5 apples and 6 oranges", n=19)
assert fruit_distribution(**test_case) == 8
```

This test case checks that the function returns 8 when the number of apples is 5, the number of oranges is 6, and the total number of fruits in the basket is 19. 

The function should also pass other test cases like:
```python
test_case = dict(s = "0 apples and 1 oranges", n=3)
assert fruit_distribution(**test_case) == 2

test_case = dict(s = "2 apples and 3 oranges", n=100)
assert fruit_distribution(**test_case) == 95

test_case = dict(s = "100 apples and 1 oranges", n=120)
assert fruit_distribution(**test_case) == 19
``` 

This will ensure that the code appropriately solves the problem and behaves as expected.
