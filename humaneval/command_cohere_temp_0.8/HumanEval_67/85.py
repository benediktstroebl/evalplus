```python
def fruit_distribution(s,n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split(' and '))
    return n - apples - oranges
```

The code directly takes in the two integers representing the number of apples and oranges from the **input string** and returns the number of mangoes as described in the problem statement.

You can use this code inside a Markdown code block by copying and pasting it into a Markdown file. Here's an example:
```python
def fruit_distribution(s,n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split(' and '))
    return n - apples - oranges
```

This way, you can run the code directly in the Markdown file without needing to create a separate Python file.
