```python
def fruit_distribution(s,n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split(' and '))
    return n - apples - oranges
```

The code uses the split method to split the string into two strings, one for apples and one for oranges. Then, using the map method, the code converts these strings into integers for more straightforward, efficient, and reliable calculations. Finally, it returns the number of mangoes based on the number of fruits in the basket and the number of apples and oranges. 

This approach ensures there are no unnecessary strings operations, which could lead to incorrect conversions, and it makes the code more efficient and easier to read. It also does not require any explicit looping and parsing of the strings with apples and oranges. 

The main logic of the code is to subtract the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits to find the number of mangoes, making it a clear and concise solution.
