```python
def fruit_distribution(s,n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split(' and '))
    return n - apples - oranges
```

The code directly takes in the input string and integer to calculate the number of mangoes with the given constraints. It splits the string into apples and oranges using the 'and' delimiter, converting the split strings into integers via the `map` function. Then, the function returns the total number of fruits minus the number of apples and oranges. The output of the given examples will be:
```
8
2
95
19
```

This approach is straightforward and works well for this particular problem and its input constraints. It's essential to consider more robust and generalized solutions for more complex tasks and various input conditions.

This problem can be solved in many other ways, including using the `re` module to parse the string and using the `sum` function to calculate the total number of fruits. Was this solution satisfactory, or would you like to try another approach? Feel free to ask for any clarifications or further suggestions to iterate toward an optimal solution.
