```python
def fruit_distribution(s,n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split(' and '))
    return n - apples - oranges
```

This Python script provides a function called `fruit_distribution` operationally designed to solve the fruit distribution problem statement, as outlined in the code block provided earlier. The function takes in two parameters, specifically, a string `s` and an integer `n`. The string `s` typically includes the aggregated number of apples and oranges indicated in the provided string, whereas the integer `n` represents the overall total of fruits in the basket. The function calculates the number of mangoes in the basket by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits, subsequently returning this calculated difference. 

The function utilizes Python's built-in `map` function to convert the string `s` into integers for the numbers of apples and oranges. This is done by splitting the string `' and '`. The function then returns the number of mangoes by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19) 
```
```bash
8
```
