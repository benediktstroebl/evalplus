```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    ans = arr.index(prev)
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] >= arr[i - 1] and arr[i] != prev:
            prev = arr[i]
            ans = i
        elif arr[i] < arr[i - 1] and arr[i] == prev:
            break
    else:
        ans = -1
    return ans
```

The problem asks us to find the largest index i in the array `arr` such that `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`. The given array will not contain duplicate values. The Python script defines a function `can_arrange` that takes in an array `arr` as input. The function uses a loop to iterate through the array, starting from index 1. It compares each element with the previous element. If the current element is greater than or equal to the previous element, the function assigns the current element as the new `prev` element and continues looping through the array to find the next element that is less than its previous element. The index of the new `prev` element is recorded in the variable `ans` whenever a new `prev` element is found. If the loop completes without finding a new `prev` element, it means there is no element in the array that satisfies the condition, and in this case, the function assigns -1 to the variable `ans`. Finally, the function returns the value of `ans`, which represents the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If no such element exists, then it returns -1.
