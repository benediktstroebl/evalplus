```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    max_idx = -1
    for idx, cur in enumerate(arr[1:], start=1):
        if cur <= prev:
            max_idx = idx
            break
        prev = cur
    return max_idx
```

The function `can_arrange` iterates through the array, comparing each element to the previous one. When an element is smaller than the previous one, the function assigns the current index to the `max_idx` and breaks the loop. If no such index is found, the function returns -1. This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the previous one.
