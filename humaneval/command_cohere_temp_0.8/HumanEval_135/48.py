```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    arranged = -1
    for idx, cur in enumerate(arr[1:], start=1):
        if cur <= prev:
            continue
        else:
            arranged = idx
            break
        prev = cur
    return arranged
```

The function `can_arrange` iterates through the array, maintaining a variable `arranged` which is set to the current index value if the criterion is met. If the current element is greater than or equal to the previous one, the loop continues, considering the next element. If an element is found that satisfies the condition, the function returns its index, and if no such element is found, the function returns -1. 

Here is a simple test suite that can be used to validate the function:
```python
def test_can_arrange():
    # Test cases with expected outputs
    assert can_arrange([1, 2, 4, 3, 5]) == 3
    assert can_arrange([1, 2, 3]) == -1
    assert can_arrange([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 5

    # Edge cases
    assert can_arrange([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) == -1
    assert can_arrange([10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5]) == -1
    assert can_arrange([]) == -1

test_can_arrange()
``` 
This should produce the following output:
```bash
.
