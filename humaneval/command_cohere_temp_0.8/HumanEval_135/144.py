```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    arranged = -1
    for idx, cur in enumerate(arr[1:], start=1):
        if cur <= prev:
            continue
        else:
            arranged = idx
            break
        prev = cur
    return arranged
```

The function `can_arrange` iterates through the list, maintaining a variable `arranged` which is set to the current index value if the criterion is not met. The loop starts from the second element (`arr[1:]`), as the first element has no preceding element to compare to. The loop increments the index (`idx`) with each iteration, controlling the loop using the `break` statement when the criterion is satisfied. If the loop completes without setting the `arranged` value, it means that no element in the list satisfies the required condition, and in this case, the function returns `-1`.

Here is a simple test suite for this function:
```python
def test_can_arrange():
    assert can_arrange([1, 2, 4, 3, 5]) == 3
    assert can_arrange([1, 2, 3]) == -1
    assert can_arrange([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == -1
    assert can_arrange([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) == -1
    assert can_arrange([10, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 11, 12]) == 6
    assert can_arrange([10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]) == -1

test_can_arrange()
``` 

This test suite contains various test cases that cover different scenarios, confirming the correctness of the `can_arrange` function.
