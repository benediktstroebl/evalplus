```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    ans = 0
    for idx, cur in enumerate(arr[1:], start=1):
        if cur > prev:
            return -1
        elif cur < prev:
            ans = idx
        prev = cur
    return ans
```

The function `can_arrange()` iterates over the array, comparing each element to the previous one. If a larger element is found, the function returns -1 immediately, indicating that no suitable element is found. If the loop completes without encountering any larger element, the current index is the largest index of an element that fits the requirement, and this value is returned. 

This approach ensures that the function finds the largest valid index without using any explicit sorting or complex data structures.  It can efficiently solve the challenge and deliver the required result.
