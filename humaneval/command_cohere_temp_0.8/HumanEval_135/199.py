```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    ans = 0
    for idx, cur in enumerate(arr[1:], start=1):
        if cur <= prev:
            continue
        prev = cur
        ans = idx
    return -1 if ans == 0 else ans
```

The function `can_arrange()` employs a loop to iterate through each element in the array, comparing it to the previous element. If the current element is greater than or equal to the previous one, it indicates that the current index cannot be the answer, and the loop continues. If the current element is less than the previous one, it means it can be the answer, so the variable `ans` is assigned the current index. Once the loop completes, the function returns -1 if `ans` is still 0, implying no suitable element is found. Otherwise, it returns the value of `ans`, representing the largest index of an element that fits the criteria.
