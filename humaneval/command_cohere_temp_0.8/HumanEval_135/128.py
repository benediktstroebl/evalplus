```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    arrange = 0
    for idx, cur in enumerate(arr[1:], start=1):
        if cur > prev:
            return -1
        elif cur >= prev:
            arrange = idx
        prev = cur
    return arrange
```

The function `can_arrange(arr)` uses a loop to examine each element in the array, starting with the second element, comparing it with the previous one. If any element is greater than the previous one, the function returns -1, indicating that no suitable element is found. Otherwise, the function iterates through the array, keeping track of the largest index `arrange` where the element is not greater than or equal to the previous one. The loop is terminated when the end of the array is reached or when a suitable element is found. 

Here is a simple test suite for this function:
```python
def test_can_arrange():
    assert can_arrange([1, 2, 4, 3, 5]) == 3
    assert can_arrange([1, 2, 3]) == -1
    assert can_arrange([0, 0, 0, 10, 5, 5, 3, 2, 1]) == 4
    assert can_arrange([7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1]) == -1
test_can_arrange()
```

The first two tests are straightforward, aligning with the problem's examples. The third test encompasses a more complex array, and the fourth test does the same for a different array.
