```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    max_idx = -1
    for i in range(n-1):
        if arr[i] >= arr[i+1]:
            max_idx = i+1
            break
    return max_idx
```

The function `can_arrange` iterates over the length of the array minus one. It compares each element with the next element. If the element is greater than or equal to the next element, the function sets the `max_idx` to the current index plus one and breaks the loop. The loop ends when a suitable element is found, or we reach the second-to-last element, at which point `max_idx` is set to -1. The initial assumption that the array's length is not zero is validated in the testing section to prevent undefined behavior.

Here is a test suite that could be used to further validate the function:
```python
def test_can_arrange():
    assert can_arrange([1, 2, 4, 3, 5]) == 3
    assert can_arrange([1, 2, 3]) == -1
    assert can_arrange([0, 1, 2, 3]) == -1
    assert can_arrange([1, -1, 2, 0, 3, -2]) == 4
    assert can_arrange([7, 7, 7, 7, 7]) == -1
    assert can_arrange([10, 9, 8, 7, 6]) == 5
    assert can_arrange([3, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == -1
```
