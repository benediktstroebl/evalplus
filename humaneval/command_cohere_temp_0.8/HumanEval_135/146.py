```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    index = 0
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]:
            continue
        else:
            index = i
            break
    return index
```

The function `can_arrange` iterates through the array, comparing each element to the previous one. When a smaller element is found, the function returns its index. If no smaller element is found, the function returns -1, indicating no suitable element.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
result = can_arrange(arr)
print(result)  # Output: 3
```

Here's how the function works:
1. Initialize the variable `prev` with the first element of the array and `index` with 0. `prev` represents the current element we're comparing with, and `index` is the index of the sought element. 
2. Begin a loop through the array, starting from the second element (`arr[1:]`)]. This loop will check each element to find the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the previous one.
3. Inside the loop, compare the current element (`arr[i]``) with the previous one (`arr[i - 1]``). If the current element is smaller, assign `index` to `i` and break the loop. This is because we've found the smallest element that is not greater than or equal to the previous one.
4. If the current element is greater than or equal to the previous one, continue to the next iteration, testing the same conditions. 
5. If the loop completes without breaking, it means no suitable element was found. In this case, the value of `index` will remain as its initial value of 0, and the function will return -1. C

This approach efficiently solves the problem using a loop and conditional checks, providing the largest index of the sought element or -1 if no such element exists.
