```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    arranged = 0
    for idx, cur in enumerate(arr[1:], start=1):
        if cur > prev:
            return -1
        elif cur < prev:
            arranged = idx
        prev = cur
    return arranged if arranged != -1 else -1
```
The function operates based on the iteration of the array indices, checking each element's relationship with the previous one. If a smaller element is found, its index is tracked in arranged, and if a larger one is observed, the function returns -1, indicating no arrangement possible. The tracked index is returned if arrangement is possible, or -1 if not. 

Here's an example usage of the function:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
result = can_arrange(arr)
print(result)  # Output: 3
```
Which will print 3, as the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the one before it is 3, found at the arrangement [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]. 

And here's another example: 
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3]
result = can_arrange(arr)
print(result)  # Output: -1
```
This will print -1, as there is no element that satisfies the condition, found at the arrangement [1, 2, 3].
