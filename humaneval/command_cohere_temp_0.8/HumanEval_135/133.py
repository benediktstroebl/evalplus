```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    index = 0
    for current in arr[1:]:
        if current > prev:
            return -1
        elif current == prev:
            continue
        else:
            prev = current
            index += 1
    return index
```

The function `can_arrange` loops through each value in the array, compares it to the previous value, and increments the index if the value is not greater than the previous one. If a value is greater, and therefore unfit to be arranged, the function returns -1. This implementation follows the problem's guidance that the array will not contain duplicate values. Thus, the function skips any duplicate values and identifies the largest index of the last suitable value. 

Here's an example usage that can be added to see the function in action:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
print(can_arrange(arr))  # Output: 3
```

This output indicates that the largest suitable index for arranging is 3, as the value 4 is greater than the value preceding it, and therefore shouldn't be considered for arrangement.
