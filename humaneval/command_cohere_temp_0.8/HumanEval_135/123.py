```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    arranged = -1
    for idx, cur in enumerate(arr[1:], start=1):
        if cur > prev:
            return arranged
        elif cur <= prev:
            arranged = idx
        prev = cur
    return arranged
```

This Python script defines a function named `can_arrange` that addresses the problem statement. It iterates through the array, comparing each element to the one preceding it. When a smaller element is encountered, the function assigns the current index as the arranged index and stops examining elements. If the entire array is sorted in ascending order, indicating no arrangement, -1 is returned. 

The provided example tests, against which the function is correctly designed to operate, demonstrate its behavior in real-world scenarios. When provided with a list of numbers that are not arranged, it identifies the index of the first out-of-order element.
