```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    index = -1
    target = arr[0]
    
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] > target:
            target = arr[i]
        elif arr[i] >= target:
            index = i
    
    return index
```

The function `can_arrange()` iterates through the array, using a variable `target` to track the element that precedes the index of the next largest value. The loop increments a variable `index` whenever the current element is greater than or equal to the `target`, indicating that the largest index has been found. The loop concludes with the value of `index` if it's greater than -1, which is the outcome if the condition for the largest index is met. If the condition is not met, the function returns -1. This method is efficient with both time and space as it uses only a single pass through the array and doesn't require any additional space.
