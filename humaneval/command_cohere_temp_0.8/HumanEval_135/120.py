```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    ind = len(arr) - 2
    while ind >= 0 and arr[ind] >= arr[ind + 1]:
        ind -= 1
    return -1 if ind == -1 else ind + 1
```

The function `can_arrange()` iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, checking if each element is greater than or equal to the preceding one. If the whole loop runs without encountering any violation of this condition, the function returns -1 to indicate no such element. Otherwise, it returns the largest index of the first element that is not greater than or equal to its preceding one.
