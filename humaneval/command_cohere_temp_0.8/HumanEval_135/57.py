```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    ans = 0
    for idx, cur in enumerate(arr[1:], start=1):
        if cur > prev:
            return -1
        elif cur < prev:
            ans = idx
        prev = cur
    return ans
```

The function `can_arrange()` iterates over the array, comparing each element to the previous one. If a larger element is found, the function returns -1 immediately, indicating that no suitable element is found. If the loop completes without encountering any larger element, the function returns the index of the last element processed, which is the largest index of an element that fits the criteria. This approach ensures efficiency and handles the cases outlined in the problem statement.
