```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    max_index = -1
    for i in range(n-1):
        if arr[i] > arr[i+1]:
            max_index = i
        if arr[i] >= arr[i+1] and i == n-1:
            max_index = -1
    return max_index
```

The function `can_arrange` iterates over the array checking each element against the element immediately preceding it. If a larger element is found at an index `i`, that index `i` is tracked in the variable `max_index`. The function will also check the last element of the array, in case it is greater than the previous element, and if so, the variable `max_index` is set to -1. The function will return -1 if there are no elements in the array. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
print(can_arrange(arr))
>> 3

arr = [1, 2, 3]
print(can_arrange(arr))
>> -1
``` 

This corresponds to the examples provided in the original problem statement.
