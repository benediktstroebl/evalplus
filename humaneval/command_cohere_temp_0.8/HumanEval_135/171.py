```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    ans = 0
    for idx, cur in enumerate(arr[1:], start=1):
        if cur > prev:
            return -1
        elif cur < prev:
            ans = idx
        prev = cur
    return ans
```

The function `can_arrange()` iterates through the array, comparing each element to the previous one. If an element is greater than or equal to the previous one, it returns -1 immediately since the condition cannot be met. Otherwise, it keeps track of the largest index `ans` where the element is smaller than the previous one, which would satisfy the condition. Finally, if the loop completes without encountering any such element, it means the entire array satisfies the condition, and the function returns the largest index `ans`.
