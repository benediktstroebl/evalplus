```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    ans = 0
    for idx, cur in enumerate(arr[1:], start=1):
        if cur > prev:
            return -1
        elif cur == prev:
            continue
        prev = cur
        ans = idx
    return ans
```

The function `can_arrange()` iterates through the array, comparing each element to the previous one. If an element is greater than the previous one, the function returns -1, indicating that no suitable element is found. If the element is equal to the previous one, it is skipped, and the loop continues. The variable `ans` keeps track of the largest index found so far, which is eventually returned. The usage example is also provided as console output to show the function in action. 

The following is the corresponding test suite code to ensure the robustness of the solution:
```python
def test_can_arrange():
    assert can_arrange([1, 2, 4, 3, 5]) == 3
    assert can_arrange([1, 2, 3]) == -1
    assert can_arrange([0, 0, 0, 10, 5]) == 4
    assert can_arrange([0, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5]) == 4
    assert can_arrange([3, 3, 4, 4, 5]) == -1

test_can_arrange()
```

This code provides multiple test cases that cover a wide range of scenarios which should be validated against the `can_arrange()` function.
