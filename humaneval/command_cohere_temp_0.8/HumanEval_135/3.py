```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    ans = -1
    arr.sort()
    for i in range(len(arr)-1):
        if arr[i] < arr[i+1]:
            return i
        if arr[i] > arr[i+1]:
            ans = i
    return ans
```
The function **can_arrange** sorts the input array and iterates through the array to find the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the preceding element. If no such element exists, it returns -1. The loop checks each element in the sorted array against its preceding element, and if the condition is met, the function returns the current index 'i'. If no suitable index is found, it returns the index where this condition is no longer met, indicating that the next element would violate the condition, hence -1 in this case. The sorting step is crucial for ensuring the correct index is identified.
