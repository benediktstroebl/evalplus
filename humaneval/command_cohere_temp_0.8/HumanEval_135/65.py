```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    max_idx = -1
    for i in range(n-1):
        if arr[i] > arr[i+1]:
            max_idx = i+1
            break
    return max_idx
```

The function `can_arrange` iterates over the length of the array minus one. It checks if each element is greater than the subsequent element and if so, it finds the largest index of such elements and breaks the loop. The loop ends when the largest index of a non-congruent element is found. If the loop has no breaks, meaning the elements are congruent from start to finish, the function returns `-1`. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
print(can_arrange(arr))     #Output: 3
```

And here is the expected output of the example: The largest index of an element not congruent to the one before it is 3 in the given example. 

Let me know if you would like me to explain anything differently or provide any further examples to make sure you have a thorough understanding of the solution!
