```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    max_idx = -1
    for idx, cur in enumerate(arr[1:], start=1):
        if cur <= prev:
            max_idx = idx
            prev = cur
    return max_idx
```

The function `can_arrange` takes an array `arr` as input and returns the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If no such element exists, it returns -1. The provided example usage demonstrates how the function can be used to solve the given problem.

Here is an example of how you may use this function with a sample input:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
result = can_arrange(arr)
print(result)  # Output: 3
``` 

The output will be 3, because the array element with the largest index that meets the requirement is 3, located at index 3.
