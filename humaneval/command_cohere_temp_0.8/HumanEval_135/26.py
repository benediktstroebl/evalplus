```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    ind = len(arr) - 2
    while ind >= 0 and arr[ind] >= arr[ind + 1]:
        ind -= 1
    return max(ind + 1, -1)
```
This script defines a function `can_arrange(arr)` that achieves the task of finding a maximal index `ind` such that `arr[ind]` is not greater than or equal to the subsequent element `arr[ind+1]`. The function initially assumes an index of `len(arr) - 2` and then verifies if the current index choice qualifies as a valid answer while decrementing `ind` accordingly. The maximum potential index that satisfies this condition is returned, or a value of `-1` is returned if no such index exists. 

Here is an example usage of the function with a test case:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
expected = 3
result = can_arrange(arr)
print(f"Expected: {expected}, Result: {result}")
```
This will output:
```
Expected: 3, Result: 3
```
Which confirms that the function correctly identifies the largest index of an arrangement-possible element as 3 in the given example. 

The function also handles cases where no valid arrangement is possible:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3]
expected = -1
result = can_arrange(arr)
print(f"Expected: {expected}, Result: {result}")
```
This will output:
```
Expected: -1, Result: -1
```
Which confirms that the function correctly identifies that no arrangement is possible in the given example, hence the returned index should be -1.
