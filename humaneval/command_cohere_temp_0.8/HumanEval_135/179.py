```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    max_index = -1
    check_index = 0
    while check_index < n:
        if arr[check_index] >= arr[check_index - 1]:
            max_index = check_index - 1
            break
        check_index += 1
    return max_index
```

The function `can_arrange` takes an array (`arr`) as input and returns the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If no such element exists, it returns -1. This algorithm iterates through the array, comparing each element to the one preceding it. It keeps track of the largest index of an allowable element using `max_index`. Once it identifies an element that doesn't adhere to the condition, the algorithm exits the loop, and `max_index` is returned if it's not -1, indicating an eligible element was found. If the loop completes without finding such an element, it returns -1, indicating no suitable element. 

This approach ensures efficiency and satisfies the constraint that the array doesn't contain duplicate values.
