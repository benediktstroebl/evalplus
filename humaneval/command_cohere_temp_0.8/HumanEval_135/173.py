```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    arrange = 0
    for idx, cur in enumerate(arr[1:], start=1):
        if cur > prev:
            return -1
        elif cur == prev:
            continue
        else:
            prev = cur
            arrange = idx
    return arrange
```

The function `can_arrange()` employs a loop to traverse an input array `arr`, iterating through each element `cur` with an index `idx` starting from the second element (`arr[1:]`). It compares each element to the one preceding it (`arr[idx - 1]`). 

If the current element is greater than its previous one, the function returns -1, indicating no suitable element for arrangement. 

If the current element is equal to its previous one, the loop continues to the next element, bypassing the equality check. 

If the current element is less than or equal to the previous one, the function tracks the largest index where this condition holds, implicitly storing it in the variable `arrange`. 

Ultimately, the function returns the established `arrange` index if all elements are less than or equal to the ones preceding them. 

The loop is explicitly structured to process each element only once, ensured by the `enumerate()` function paired with the `start=1` parameter, which shifts the index tally to account for the skipped first element. 

This concise version adheres to Python's famous "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it." philosophy.
