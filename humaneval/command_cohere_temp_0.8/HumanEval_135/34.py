```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    ans = -1
    for i in range(len(arr)-1):
        if arr[i]<arr[i+1]:
            ans = i+1
            break
    return ans
```
The function `can_arrange()` takes an array (`arr`) as input and returns the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If no such element exists, it returns -1. This is achieved by iterating over the array and checking each element against its subsequent element. Once a suitable element is found, the function returns its index plus one (assuming it's the largest eligible index). If no such element is found, the function returns -1. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
print(can_arrange(arr))  # Output: 3
arr = [1, 2, 3]
print(can_arrange(arr))  # Output: -1
```

This is to ensure that the array can be sorted without violating the ordering requirement for mergesort, where adjacent elements must be in the correct order.  If no such element exists, it implies that the entire array is already sorted in ascending order, so sorting is not necessary. Thus, the function returns -1 in this case. 

Note: this approach has a time complexity of O(n) since it requires iterating through the entire array once. Although this is sufficient for small arrays, alternative solutions may be preferable for efficiency purposes with larger arrays.
