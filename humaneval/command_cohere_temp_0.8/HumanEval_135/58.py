```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    index = 0
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]:
            continue
        else:
            index = i
            break
    return index
```

The function `can_arrange` takes an array `arr` as an input and returns the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If no such element exists, it returns -1. This algorithm traverses the array and compares each element with the previous one. If the condition is satisfied, the function continues to the next element. If the condition is not satisfied, the function returns the current index. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
print(can_arrange(arr))  # Output: 3

arr = [1, 2, 3]
print(can_arrange(arr))  # Output: -1
```

This demonstrates the function working as designed for the given problem statement.
