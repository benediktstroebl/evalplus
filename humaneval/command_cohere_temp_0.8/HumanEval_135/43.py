```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    index = 0
    for curr in arr[1:]:
        if curr <= prev:
            index += 1
            prev = curr
    return index if index < len(arr) else -1
```

This Python script defines a function named `can_arrange`, which takes an array `arr` as input. It aims to find the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. In other words, it searches for the first element that strictly increases the sequence. The function initializes a variable `index` to 0 and sets `prev` to the first element of the array. It then iterates through the remaining elements of the array, comparing each current element `curr` to the previous element `prev`. If `curr` is less than or equal to `prev`, the function increments `index` and updates `prev` to `curr`. This process continues until a suitable element is found or until the end of the array is reached. Finally, the function returns the value of `index` if a valid index is found, indicating the largest index of an eligible element. If no such element is found, it returns -1 to indicate failure. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
result = can_arrange(arr)
print(result)  # Output: 3
```

And another example:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3]
result = can_arrange(arr)
print(result)  # Output: -1
```

Above each example, the function is called with an array as input, and the resulting output is printed, demonstrating the function's functionality.
