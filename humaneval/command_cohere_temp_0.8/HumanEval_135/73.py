```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    index = 0
    for current in arr[1:]:
        if current > prev:
            return -1
        elif current == prev:
            continue
        else:
            prev = current
            index += 1
    return index
```

The function `can_arrange` iterates through the array, maintaining two variables: `prev` to hold the value of the element immediately preceding the current element, and `index` to track the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the previous one. As the loop unfolds, the `index` value is updated and returned once reaching the first valid element. If no valid element is found, the function returns -1. 

Here's an example usage explanation:
```python
print(can_arrange([1, 2, 4, 3, 5]))  # Outputs: 3
print(can_arrange([1, 2, 3]))  # Outputs: -1
```

This demonstrates the function's behavior. In the first example, the function returns 3 because it identifies the element at index 3 (with a value of 3) as the first non-consecutive element that is not greater than or equal to its preceding element. In the second example, the function returns -1 because the array contains consecutive values, and no element satisfies the requirement.  This succinctly illustrates the problem's stipulation in terms of providing a function that identifies the largest index of a non-consecutive element.  This could have practical applications in sorting or filtering algorithms where unique and ordered elements are necessary.
