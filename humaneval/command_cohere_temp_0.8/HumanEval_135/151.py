```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    n = len(arr) - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > arr[i+1]:
            return i
    return -1
```

This Python script defines a function named `can_arrange`, which takes an array `arr` as input. This function is designed to identify the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. In other words, it finds the largest index of the first element that is not improperly placed in the array. This function iterates through the array from the last element toward the first element, checking each element against its preceding element. If an element is greater than its preceding element, it indicates that it is not properly placed, and the function continues scanning until it finds the first element that is not greater than its preceding element. The function returns the index of this element, or if no such element is found, it returns -1 to indicate that there are no properly arranged elements in the given array. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
result = can_arrange(arr)
print(result)  # Output: 3
```
Here, the function returns 3, indicating that the element at index 3 (with a value of 3) is the first element that is not greater than or equal to the preceding element, satisfying the criteria of being properly arranged.

Another example usage is:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3]
result = can_arrange(arr)
print(result)  # Output: -1
```
In this case, the function returns -1, indicating that no element in the array satisfies the condition, as all elements are greater than or equal to the preceding ones.
