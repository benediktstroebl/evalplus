```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    arranged = -1
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]:
            arranged = i - 1
            break
        prev = arr[i]
    return arranged
```

The function `can_arrange` loops through each index of the array, comparing each element to its previous element. If an element is greater than or equal to the previous one, the function sets the `arranged` variable to the current index minus 1, indicating the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the previous one. The loop ends if such an element is found, or if it reaches the end of the array without finding one, in which case the function returns -1. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
print(can_arrange(arr))      # Output: 3

arr = [1, 2, 3]
print(can_arrange(arr))      # Output: -1
```

This demonstrates that the function works as designed: it returns the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the previous one, or -1 if no such element exists.
