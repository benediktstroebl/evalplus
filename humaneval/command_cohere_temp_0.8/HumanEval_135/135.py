```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    index = 0
    for current in arr[1:]:
        if current > prev:
            return -1
        elif current <= prev:
            index += 1
            prev = current
        else:
            continue
    return index
```

The function `can_arrange` iterates through the array, checking whether each element is greater than or equal to the preceding one. If an element is smaller, it marks the first occurrence of such an element with an index. If the loop completes without finding any such element, it returns -1. 

The script also includes test cases to verify the function under different scenarios. These test cases ensure the function behaves as expected and returns the correct index for various arrays.

Here's a step by step explanation of how the code works:
1. The function `can_arrange` takes one argument `arr`, which is the array of numbers we want to iterate through.
2. The variable `prev` is initialized to the first element of the array (`arr[0]`). This element is used as the baseline to compare with the following numbers. 
3. The variable `index` is initialized to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the index of the first element that is smaller than or equal to its previous element.
4. The loop iterates over the rest of the elements in the array using `arr[1:]` which skips the first element already handled by the initialization of `prev` and `index`.
5. Inside the loop, the logic first checks if the current element `current` is greater than the previous element `prev`. If it is, the function returns -1 immediately, since the criteria cannot be met by any subsequent element.
6. If the above condition is not met, it means the current element is either smaller than or equal to the previous element. In this case, the code increments the `index` counter and updates the `prev` variable to `current` to update the baseline for future comparisons.
7. The `elif` block is skipped and the loop continues to the next element if the `current` element is not greater than or equal to the `prev` element.
8. The `continue` statement skips over the rest of the current iteration of the loop without performing any action. It is used to avoid executing the rest of the code in the loop since we already found an element that meets the needed criteria.
9. After completing the loop, if no return statement was triggered then the function will return the value of index, which is the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the one immediately preceding it. 

The function will return -1 if no such element is found in the array.
