```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    ans = 0
    for idx, cur in enumerate(arr[1:], start=1):
        if cur > prev:
            return -1
        elif cur < prev:
            ans = idx
        prev = cur
    return ans
```
The code defines a Python function `can_arrange` that solves the problem as described in the prompt. It iterates through the array, keeping track of the previous element and checking if each current element is greater than or equal to the previous one. If an element is smaller, it indicates a valid position to arrange the array properly, and the function stores the largest such index. If no suitable element is found, it returns -1.
