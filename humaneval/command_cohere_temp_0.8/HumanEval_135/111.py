```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    max_idx = -1
    for idx, val in enumerate(arr):
        if val <= arr[idx - 1]:
            continue
        max_idx = idx
        break
    return max_idx
```

The function `can_arrange` checks each element in the array against the previous element and identifies the largest index of the first element that is greater than its previous element. The loop iterates through the array using the `enumerate` function to track both the index `idx` and the value `val` of each element. If an element is greater than or equal to the previous element, it is skipped. Once an element satisfies the condition, the function breaks out of the loop, assuming that all subsequent elements will also satisfy it, and assigns `max_idx` with the current index. The function returns `-1` if it doesn't find any suitable element. 

Here is an example of how you might use this function on the command line:
```python
can_arrange([1, 2, 4, 3, 5]) # 3
can_arrange([1, 2, 3]) # -1
``` 

This will return the expected outputs of 3 and -1 respectively, as expressed in the example technical description.
