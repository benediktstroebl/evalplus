```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    ind = len(arr) - 2
    while ind >= 0 and arr[ind] >= arr[ind + 1]:
        ind -= 1
    return -1 if ind == -1 else ind + 1
```
The function `can_arrange()` iterates through the array `arr` in reverse order and checks if there is a suitable element at each index. An index 'ind' is chosen as a candidate if the following condition is satisfied: `arr[ind] < arr[ind + 1]`. The loop continues until a candidate is found or the beginning of the array is reached. The initial assumption for the candidate index is the second-to-last index 'ind = len(arr) - 2'. The return statement returns `-1` if no suitable index is found, implying that the condition is not met for any element, or the incremented index if a suitable element is found.
