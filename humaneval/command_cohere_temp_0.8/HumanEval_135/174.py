```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    arrange = 0
    for idx, cur in enumerate(arr[1:], start=1):
        if cur > prev:
            return -1
        elif cur >= prev:
            arrange = idx
        prev = cur
    return arrange
```

The algorithm works by first setting the variable `arrange` to the first index of the first element in the list and `prev` to the first element. Then it iterates through the list with a loop, at each iteration, it checks the elements against the conditions and rearranges the indices. After completing the loop, the `arrange` variable will contain the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the one before it, according to the conditions specified in the prompt. If no such element exists, it returns -1.  This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list.
