            prev_tmp = arr[idx - 1]
            for i in range(idx + 1, len(arr_tmp)):
                if arr_tmp[i] > prev_tmp:
                    continues = False
                    break
            if continues:
                arranges.append(idx)

The function `can_arrange()` employs a loop to iterate through an input array `arr`. While iterating, it also maintains the value of the element immediately preceding the current element (`prev`). It identifies arrangements where each element is not greater than or equal to the preceding one. If such arrangements exist, it returns the index of the element with the largest index among these permissible arrangements. If no such arrangements are present, it returns -1 to signify no suitable arrangement. 

The function relies on two nested loops, the outer one iterates over the array and maintains the previous element, while the inner one checks for arrangements and identifies indices for permissible arrangements. This approach allows the function to efficiently identify the maximum index of elements that can be arranged without violating the problem statement's conditions. 

The function's time complexity is O(n^2) due to the nested loops, and its space complexity is O(n) as it creates temporary variables for the arrangement check. 

This solution may be supplemented with additional unit tests to ensure its robustness and verify its performance for various input scenarios.
