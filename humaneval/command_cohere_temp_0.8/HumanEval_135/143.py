```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    arranged = -1
    for idx, cur in enumerate(arr[1:], start=1):
        if cur > prev:
            return arranged
        elif cur <= prev:
            arranged = idx
        prev = cur
    return arranged
```

The function `can_arrange` iterates through the array, tracking the previous element in the loop. It returns the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the previous one. If no such element exists, it returns -1. This algorithm avoids duplicates and completes a single pass through the array.

Here is a simple test case to verify the functionality of the function:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
assert can_arrange(arr) == 3
```

And here is a more comprehensive test:
```python
def test_can_arrange():
    assert can_arrange([1, 2, 4, 3, 5]) == 3
    assert can_arrange([1, 2, 3]) == -1
    assert can_arrange([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) == 4
    assert can_arrange([2, 3, 4, 9999, 1]) == -1
    assert can_arrange([0, -1, -2, -3, -4]) == -1
    assert can_arrange([2, 2, 3, 1]) == 3
    assert can_arrange([10, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) == 5
    assert can_arrange([11, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1]) == -1
``` 

To ensure clarity, please note that the function assumes the given array will not contain duplicate values.
