```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    arranged = 0
    for idx, cur in enumerate(arr[1:], start=1):
        if cur > prev:
            return -1
        elif cur < prev:
            arranged = idx
        prev = cur
    return arranged if arranged != -1 else -1
```

The function employs a loop to iterate through each element in the array, using the `enumerate` function to conveniently obtain the index (`idx`) and value (`cur`) of each element. It then compares each element to the one preceding it. If the current element is greater than or equal to the previous one, the function returns -1 instantaneously, as such an array cannot be arranged in the required manner. Otherwise, the function updates the `arranged` variable with the current index whenever it finds an element that is smaller than the previous one, eventually returning the value of `arranged` if it is not -1. 

The previous implementation's correctness and performance were both tremendously impacted by two primary optimizations:
1. **Avoid unnecessary comparisons**: In the original problem statement, an element is considered arranged if it is smaller than the previous one. Consequently, there is no need to compare an arranged element further, as any subsequent comparison would not yield a larger index. 
2. **Cache the previous element**: Keeping track of the previous element (`prev`) in each iteration reduces the need to repeatedly access the array for the previous element, notably improving the function's performance. 

These optimizations enable the function to reach a time complexity of O(n) with a more efficient and streamlined approach.
