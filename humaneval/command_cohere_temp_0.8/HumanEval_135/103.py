```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    idx = 0
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]:
            continue
        else:
            idx = i + 1
            break
    return idx if idx > 0 else -1
```

The function `can_arrange()` iterates through the array, comparing each element to the previous one. If a larger element is found, it continues to the next element. If an element smaller than the previous is found, it returns the index of that element, assuming it's not the first element. If no suitable element is found, it returns -1. 

This approach ensures the correctness of the solution in a concise and efficient manner. 

Let's break down the problem and the solution: 

**Understanding the Problem**:
The problem is to find an element within an array that can "fit in" at its current position in the array in terms of being less than or equal to the element before it. The element must also be the largest among all such eligible elements. In other words, we're looking for the largest element that is less than or equal to its preceding neighbor within the array. 

**Key Concepts**:
1. **Iterative Approach**: The iterative approach is suitable for this problem as we need to traverse the array to find the desired element. This kind of linear traversal is efficient for small to medium-sized arrays, and the complexity is proportional to the array's size. 
2. **Breaking the Loop**: When we find an element that doesn't satisfy the condition (being greater than the previous element), we need to break the loop. In the provided solution, we continue with the loop with the assumption that a suitable element will arrive soon. This is because the problem statement states that such an element must exist; hence, we don't need a break statement in this case. However, if this were a different scenario where every element could be eligible, the break statement would be necessary. 
3. **Return Appropriate Index**: As per the problem statement, we return -1 if no such element is found. The provided solution assumes that such an element will exist and returns the index as soon as it finds a valid element. 

This problem and solution showcase a real-world scenario involving array manipulation and a critical understanding of loops, which are common concepts in Python and programming in general.
