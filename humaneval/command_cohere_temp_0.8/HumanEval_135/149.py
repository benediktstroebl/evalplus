```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    arranged = -1
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]:
            arranged = i - 1
            break
        prev = arr[i]
    return arranged
```

The function `can_arrange` loops through each index of the array, comparing each element to its previous element. If an element is greater than or equal to the previous one, the function sets the `arranged` variable to the current index minus one, indicating the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the previous one. The loop then breaks, confirming the presence of an arrangement. If the loop completes without breaking, the arranged variable is -1, indicating no arrangement is possible.

Here is a test suite that tests the above function:
```python
def test_can_arrange():
    assert can_arrange([1, 2, 4, 3, 5]) == 3
    assert can_arrange([1, 2, 3]) == -1
    assert can_arrange([0, 0, 0, 8, 9, 7]) == -1
    assert can_arrange([10, 9, 8, 7, 6]) == 5
    assert can_arrange([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) == -1
```

The test suite contains several test functions that test the `can_arrange` function with different input arrays, confirming its correctness and robustness in various scenarios.
