```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    arranged = -1
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]:
            continue
        else:
            arranged = i
            break
    return arranged
```

The function `can_arrange` iterates through the array, comparing each element to the previous one. If an element is smaller than the previous one, the arrangement is possible, and the function returns the current index. If the loop completes without breaking, no arrangement is possible, and the function returns -1.

This approach ensures that the function considers the elements in their current order without rearranging them and returns the largest possible index for arrangement or -1 if no arrangement is possible. 

This solution can be improved upon by utilizing Python's `max` function, which can provide a concise solution to this problem.

This problem can be approached by using the `max` function to find the maximum index of elements not greater than or equal to the previous one in the list. The `max` function yields the index of the first element that does not fulfill the condition, indicating the largest index that can be arranged. If no such element exists, `max` will return -1, providing a concise solution to the problem. 

Here is an example of how this approach can be implemented:
```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    return max(range(len(arr)), key=lambda i: arr[i] >= arr[i - 1])
```
