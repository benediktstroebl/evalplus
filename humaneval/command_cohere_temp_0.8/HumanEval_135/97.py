```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    ans = arr.index(prev)
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]:
            continue
        else:
            ans = i + 1
            break
    return max(ans, -1)
```

The function `can_arrange()` takes an array (`arr`) as input and iterates through it. The variable `prev` stores the value of the first element, and `ans` is initially set to the index of the first element, assuming that the array is in order. Then, using a `for` loop, it checks each element against the previous one, skipping those that are greater than or equal, and updating `ans` when it finds a suitable element. Finally, it returns the largest value of `ans` or -1 if no suitable element is found.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
print(can_arrange(arr))
# Output: 3

arr = [1, 2, 3]
print(can_arrange(arr))
# Output: -1
```

The example usage demonstrates the function's behavior as described in the problem statement: it returns the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the previous one, or -1 if no such element exists.
