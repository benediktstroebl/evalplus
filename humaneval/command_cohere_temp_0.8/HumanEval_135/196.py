```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    arranged = 0
    for idx, cur in enumerate(arr[1:], start=1):
        if cur <= prev:
            continue
        arranged = idx
        break
    return arranged if arranged != len(arr) and arr[arranged] <= arr[arranged - 1] else -1
```

The function employs a simple loop to iterate through the array, comparing each element to the one before it. The largest index of an element that isn't greater than or equal to the previous one is recorded as the answer. One nuance worth noting is that the function also checks if the element at the 'arranged' index is less than or equal to its preceding neighbor to ensure it's a valid arrangement. This adjustment prevents a faulty positive result for a non-arrangeable disposition. 

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and is an efficient solution to the problem.

The following test cases illustrate how the function behaves:
```python
arr1 = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
arr2 = [1, 2, 3]

print(can_arrange(arr1))  # Expected output: 3
print(can_arrange(arr2))  # Expected output: -1
```
