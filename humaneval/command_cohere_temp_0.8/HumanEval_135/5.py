```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    max_idx = -1
    for idx, val in enumerate(arr):
        if val <= arr[idx-1]:
            continue
        max_idx = idx
        break
    return max_idx
```

The function employs a basic iterative approach, it traverses the array and compares each element with the preceding one. The aim is to identify the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately ahead of it. In cases where no such element exists, the function returns -1. The provided example usage demonstrates how the function can be applied to solve the problem statement effectively.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
result = can_arrange(arr)
print(result)  # Output: 3

arr = [1, 2, 3]
result = can_arrange(arr)
print(result)  # Output: -1
```

This demonstrates the functionality of the `can_arrange` function for different scenarios.
