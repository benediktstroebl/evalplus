```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    idx = 0
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]:
            continue
        else:
            idx = i + 1
            break
    return idx if idx > 0 else -1
```

The function iterates through the array, comparing each element to the previous one. If they are not in the required order, it increments the index and breaks the loop. If the loop completes without breaking, it means the element was equal to or greater than the previous, so we return -1. The provided example tests in the code demonstrate how the function works. 

Here is a test case that aligns with the provided example: 

```python
test_cases = [
    ([1, 2, 4, 3, 5], 3),
    ([1, 2, 3], -1),
    ([1, 2, 2, 3, 5], 3),
    ([1, 3, 3, 7, 5], 4),
]

for arr, expected in test_cases:
    assert can_arrange(arr) == expected
``` 

This would output:
