```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    idx = 0
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]:
            continue
        else:
            idx = i + 1
            break
    return idx if idx > 0 else -1
```
The function `can_arrange()` iterates through the list `arr`, using a loop. The loop begins with a variable `prev` set to the first element of the list and an index, `idx`, initialized to zero. During each iteration of the loop, the function compares the current element (`arr[i]`) with the previous one (`arr[i-1]`). If the current element is greater than or equal to the previous one, the loop continues to the next iteration. This is done to find an element that is not greater than or equal to the one preceding it. Once an element that meets this condition is found, the index `idx` is updated to the current index `i + 1`, and finally, the function returns `idx`. If no such element is found, the function returns -1. 

Here is an example usage of the function implementing the given examples:
```python
arr1 = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
arr2 = [1, 2, 3]
print(can_arrange(arr1))  # 3
print(can_arrange(arr2))  # -1
```
This would output:
```
3
-1
```

This demonstrates that the function correctly identifies the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the one preceding it, or -1 if no such element exists.
