```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]:
            continue
        if arr[i] > prev:
            ans = i
        prev = arr[i]
    return -1 if ans == 0 else ans
```
The function `can_arrange()` takes an array (`arr`) as input and returns the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If no such element exists, it returns -1. The function uses a loop to traverse the array and maintains a variable `ans` to store the largest index found so far. It also uses a variable `prev` to store the previous element in the array. During each iteration, it checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the previous one. If not, it continues with the loop. If so, it checks if the current element is greater than the previous one and if so, it updates the answer. Finally, the answer is -1 if no valid answer is found.
