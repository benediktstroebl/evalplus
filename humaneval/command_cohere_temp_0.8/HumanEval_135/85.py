```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    ind = len(arr) - 2
    while ind >= 0 and arr[ind] >= arr[ind + 1]:
        ind -= 1
    return max(ind + 1, -1)
```
This script defines a function `can_arrange(arr)` that solves the problem as specified in the prompt. It iterates through the array from the end and assigns the index of the first element that is not greater than or equal to the previous element, or -1 if no such element exists. The function returns the largest index of an element that fits the criteria, or -1 if none is found. 

To follow the convention of the provided examples, a return value of 3 signifies that a valid arrangement can be achieved at index 3, while a return value of -1 indicates that no suitable element exists. Feel free to adapt this solution to your needs or explore different approaches to problem solving.
