```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    index = 0
    for curr in arr[1:]:
        if curr <= prev:
            index += 1
            prev = curr
        else:
            break
    return index if index < len(arr) else -1
```

The function `can_arrange` iterates through the array, comparing each element to the previous one. If an element is greater than or equal to the previous one, it continues the loop. If an element is smaller, it means it can be arranged at the beginning of the array, so it increments the index and updates the `prev` variable. Once the loop is broken, it means that there is no suitable element, and the function returns -1. 

To make the function robust and handle the edge case of an empty array, the loop includes a break statement, and the index validation includes a check for index length. 

This approach ensures that the function considers all relevant elements and efficiently identifies the arrangement opportunity, contributing to clean and understandable code. 
The function can be tested as follows:
```python
arr1 = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
arr2 = [1, 2, 3]

print(can_arrange(arr1))  # Output: 3
print(can_arrange(arr2))  # Output: -1
``` 
This showcases the functionality of the `can_arrange` function. 

The function effectively handles the edge case and provides the index of the first element that can be arranged without leading to an inferior arrangement.
