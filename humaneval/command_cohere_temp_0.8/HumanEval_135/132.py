```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    arranged = -1
    for idx, cur in enumerate(arr[1:], start=1):
        if cur <= prev:
            continue
        arranged = idx
        break
    return arranged
```

The function `can_arrange` iterates through the array, comparing each element to the previous one. When an element greater than the previous one is found, the loop continues and the index of the current element is recorded as the output. If the loop completes without breaking, it means no such element exists, and the function returns -1. 

To verify the correctness of the provided solution, we can create a test harness that runs the function with various inputs and ensures that it outputs the expected values. Here is an example:
```python
def test_can_arrange():
    # Test cases with expected outputs
    assert can_arrange([1, 2, 4, 3, 5]) == 3
    assert can_arrange([1, 2, 3]) == -1

    # Edge case: empty list
    assert can_arrange([]) == -1

    # Mixed cases
    assert can_arrange([1, 2, 4, 5, 1]) == 3
    assert can_arrange([1, 2, 3, 2]) == -1
    assert can_arrange([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) == 3
    assert can_arrange([3, 2, 1]) == -1

test_can_arrange()
```

This test suite contains different test cases that cover different scenarios which the `can_arrange` function is expected to handle. 

Note that the code assumes that the list is sorted in ascending order, as specified in the problem statement.
