```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    arranged = 0
    for idx, cur in enumerate(arr[1:], start=1):
        if cur > prev:
            return -1
        elif cur == prev:
            continue
        else:
            arranged = idx
            prev = cur
    return arranged
```

The function `can_arrange()` iterates over the entire array, comparing each element to the one preceding it. If an element is greater than its previous one, the function returns -1, indicating no suitable element for arrangement. If an element is equal to the previous one, it is skipped, and the search continues. Otherwise, the function identifies the largest index of an arranged element and returns it, considering that the last element is always arranged. This approach ensures effectiveness and clarity in finding the desired index in the given scenario.
