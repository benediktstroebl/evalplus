```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    index = 0
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]:
            continue
        else:
            index = i
            break
    return index
```

The function `can_arrange` takes an array `arr` as input and iterates through it. It checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the previous one, if so, it continues to the next iteration until it finds an element that doesn't meet this condition. When such an element is found, its index is returned, the loop is interrupted, and the function returns the index of this element as the result.

The following test cases illustrate the correctness of the function:
```python
arr1 = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
print(can_arrange(arr1))  # Expected output: 3

arr2 = [1, 2, 3]
print(can_arrange(arr2))  # Expected output: -1
```

The provided examples showcase how the function successfully identifies the correct index of elements that do not meet the specified condition and returns -1 when no such element is found.
