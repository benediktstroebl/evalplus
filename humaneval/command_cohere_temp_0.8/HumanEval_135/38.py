```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    max_idx = -1
    for i in range(n-1):
        if arr[i] > arr[i+1]:
            max_idx = i
        if arr[i] >= arr[i-1] and i-1 != -1:
            max_idx = i-1
    return max_idx
```

This function uses a simple iterative approach to find the index of the first element that does not meet the specified criteria. The loop goes through each element apart from the last and compares it with the next element. If the current element is greater than the next one, the function sets the `max_idx` to the current index, as this is the first element that satisfies the problem conditions. If the current element is equal to or greater than the previous one, the function checks if there is a previous element (excluding the case of an array with only one element) and if so, assigns the current index minus one to `max_idx`, as this is the first occurrence of such an element. The loop continues until the last element is checked, and if the conditions are not fulfilled by any element, the function returns -1 to indicate that there are no such elements in the array. 

The function`can_arrange` is designed to return the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the immediately preceding element in the given array. If no such element exists, it returns -1. This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies the index of the first problematic element and provides an indication when no such element is found.
