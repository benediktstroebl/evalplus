```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]:
            continue
        if arr[i] > prev:
            ans = i
        prev = arr[i]
    return -1 if ans == 0 else ans
```

The function `can_arrange()` iterates over the list `arr`, maintaining two variables: `prev`, which stores the value of the element preceding the current iteration, and `ans`, which stores the index of the first element greater than its preceding element. During each iteration, if the current element is greater than or equal to its preceding element, it is skipped, and the search continues. If the current element is greater than the preceding element and the value of `ans` is 0, it is reassigned to the current index `i`, indicating a new starting point for the arrangement. Finally, if the loop completes without encountering such an element, the function returns -1 to indicate that no valid arrangement exists. 

Here is a simple test case to verify the functionality of the provided solution:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
expected_index = 3

actual_index = can_arrange(arr)

print(f"For the array {arr}, the expected largest index of an element that can be arranged is {expected_index}. Did the function return the expected result?: {actual_index == expected_index}")
```

Output:
```
For the array [1, 2, 4, 3, 5], the expected largest index of an element that can be arranged is 3. Did the function return the expected result?: True
```

This test case correctly identifies index 3 as the largest index of an element that can be arranged correctly, so it passes. 

This approach assumes that the array contains at least one element. If the array is empty, the function will throw an IndexError. You can handle this scenario with a simple if condition to return -1 for an empty array. 
Here is the updated function: 

```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    if len(arr) == 0:
        return -1
    prev = arr[0]
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]:
            continue
        if arr[i] > prev:
            ans = i
        prev = arr[i]
    return -1 if ans == 0 else ans
``` 

Now, the function will return -1 for an empty array or for an array with no suitable element to arrange, respectively.
