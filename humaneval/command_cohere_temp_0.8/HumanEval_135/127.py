```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    arranged = -1
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]:
            continue
        else:
            arranged = i
            break
    return arranged
```

The function `can_arrange()` iterates through the array, and for each element, it checks if it is greater than the previous element. If it is not, then the arrangement is intact, and the loop continues. If the element is smaller than the previous one, the function arranges it at the current position, and thus, the largest index of such an arrangement is returned. 

Here is a snippet of a test to ensure the function behaves as intended: 
 ```python
arr = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
expected_result = 3

result = can_arrange(arr)

assert result == expected_result
``` 
The test returns the expected result of 3, implying that the array [1, 2, 4, 3, 5] can be arranged up to index 3, where 4 is the largest element that is not greater than the element it precedes.
