```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    arranged = -1
    for idx, cur in enumerate(arr[1:], start=1):
        if cur > prev:
            return arranged
        elif cur <= prev:
            arranged = idx
        prev = cur
    return arranged
```
This Python script defines a function called `can_arrange`, which takes an array (`arr`) as input. The purpose of this function is to identify the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. In other words, it finds the largest index of the first element that is not improperly arranged in the array. If such an element is not found, the function returns -1 to indicate that all elements are improperly arranged. The function iterates through the array, keeping track of the previous element and the current element, checking if each subsequent element is greater than or equal to the previous one. If it finds an element that violates this condition, it records the index and continues checking. The function returns the largest index of the first improperly arranged element, or -1 if none is found.
