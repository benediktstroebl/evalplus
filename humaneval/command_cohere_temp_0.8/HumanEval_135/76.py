```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    ans = 0
    for idx, cur in enumerate(arr[1:], start=1):
        if cur > prev:
            return -1
        elif cur == prev:
            continue
        else:
            prev = cur
            ans = idx
    return ans
```

The function `can_arrange()` iterates over the entire array, comparing each element to the previous one. If an element is greater than the previous one, the function returns -1 immediately, indicating that no suitable element is found. If the element is equal to the previous one, it is skipped, and the loop continues. Finally, when a suitable element is found (i.e., it is not greater than or equal to the previous one), its index is assigned to the variable `ans` and returned once the loop completes. 

This Python script accurately identifies the largest index of an element that fulfills the given conditions, thus correctly solving the problem.
