```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    max_idx = -1
    for i in range(n-1):
        if arr[i] >= arr[i+1]:
            max_idx = i+1
            break
    return max_idx
```

The function `can_arrange` iterates over the array from index `0` to `n-2`, where `n` is the length of the array. It checks if each element is greater than or equal to the subsequent element. If a suitable element is found, its index is assigned to the `max_idx` variable and the loop exits. The function returns `-1` if no suitable element is found. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
result = can_arrange(arr)
print(result)  # Output: 3
```

This would output:
```
3
```

Since the target element (index 3) is the first index that satisfies the criterion, where the value 4 is not greater than or equal to the preceding element.
