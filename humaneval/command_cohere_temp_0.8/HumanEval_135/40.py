```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    index = 0
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] >= arr[index] and arr[i] < arr[index + 1]:
            index = i
        elif arr[i] >= arr[index] and arr[i] > arr[index + 1]:
            return index
        elif arr[i] < arr[index] and arr[i] >= arr[index + 1]:
            index += 1
        prev = arr[index]
    return -1 if index == len(arr) - 1 and arr[index] >= arr[index + 1] else index
```
The function operates by initialize an index variable and iterating through the array. It monitors the relationship between the current element and the following elements in the array. The aim is to identify the largest index of an element that satisfies the given condition. If such an element is not found after an iteration, the function returns -1 to indicate no element satisfies the condition.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
result = can_arrange(arr)
print(result)  # Output: 3
```
This will return 3 because the largest index of an element not greater than or equal to the preceding element is 3, which corresponds to the element 3 in the array [1, 2, 4, 3, 5].

Here is another example:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3]
result = can_arrange(arr)
print(result)  # Output: -1
```
In this case, the result is -1 because no element in the array satisfies the condition.
