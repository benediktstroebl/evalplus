```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    ans = 0
    for idx, cur in enumerate(arr[1:], start=1):
        if cur > prev:
            return -1
        elif cur < prev:
            ans = idx
        prev = cur
    return ans
```
The solution uses a loop and optionally the enumerate function to iterate through each element in the array. The variable `ans` is used to keep track of the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the previous element. If no such element is found, the function returns -1. The variable `prev` is used to keep track of the previous element encountered. 

The loop first compares each element to the first element of the array (`arr[0]`), as it has no preceding element to compare to. Then, it compares each element to the previously considered element, `prev`. This way, the loop will correctly identify the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the previous element, or it will return -1 if no such element exists. 

The solution is tailored to the problem statement, assuming no time complexity constraints, and provides an efficient and effective way to achieve the desired outcome.
