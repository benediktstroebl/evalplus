```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    arranged = -1
    for idx, cur in enumerate(arr[1:], start=1):
        if cur <= prev:
            continue
        arranged = idx
        break
    return arranged
```

The function `can_arrange` loops through each index of the array, comparing each element to the one preceding it. If the element is greater than or equal to the previous one, it is skipped. If an element is smaller than the previous one, the variable `arranged` is updated to the current index, and the loop is terminated. Upon completion of the loop, the function returns the value of `arranged` if it was updated, or -1 if no suitable element was found. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
print(can_arrange(arr))
>> 3

arr = [1, 2, 3]
print(can_arrange(arr))
>> -1
``` 

This demonstrates that the function works as requested in the prompt: It finds the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the one preceding it in the array, or -1 if no such element exists.
