```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    arranged = -1
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]:
            continue
        else:
            arranged = i
            break
    return arranged
```

The function `can_arrange` loops through each index of the array, checking if the current element is greater than or equal to the previous one. If it's not, and an arrangement can be made, the function returns the current index. If no arrangement can be made, the function returns -1.

This solution can be improved upon by employing a binary search, which will be more efficient for larger arrays. 

Let's break down the problem from a high-level understanding, as well as the improved solution for it:
**Approach without Binary Search:**
1. The array is traversed element by element.
2. For each element, it checks if it can be placed at the beginning of the array.
3. If true, the index is returned. If not, it continues the loop.
4. This process continues until an arrangable element is found, or the loop finishes.

**Approach with Binary Search:**
1. Start with the median of the array.
2. Perform a binary search on the array, shifting the right half to the left.
3. The search range is effectively halved with each iteration.
4. Once an element is found that is greater than the median, the process stops.
5. The index of the element that was found is returned.

The improved solution using binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), which is a significant improvement over the O(n) of the naive approach.
