```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    arranged = -1
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]:
            continue
        arranged = i
        break
    return arranged
```

The function `can_arrange` loops through each index of the array, checking if the element at the current index is greater than or equal to the element preceding it. If it isn't, the function arranges it at the correct position and returns its index. The loop increments until the correct arrangement is found, or it has checked all elements. If no suitable element is found, the function returns -1. 

This solution is straightforward and optimally efficient, with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array. 

Please note that this code assumes that the input array does not contain any leading zeros, as the first element is used as the baseline for comparison. Leading zeros can be handled by adding an additional check before the first loop iteration, as follows: 
```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    arranged = -1
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]:
            continue
        arranged = i
        break
    return arranged
``` 
This modification provides a robust solution that handles arrays with leading zeros or elements that are not greater than the preceding one.
