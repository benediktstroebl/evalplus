```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    max_idx = -1
    for i in range(n-1):
        if arr[i] >= arr[i+1]:
            max_idx = i+1
            break
    return max_idx
```

The function `can_arrange` takes an array `arr` as input and returns the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If no such element exists, it returns -1. This algorithm iterates through the array and compares each element to its subsequent element, tracking the largest index that satisfies the condition and breaking the loop once it finds the first element that fails the condition. The result is the largest index of an element that fits the given condition.
