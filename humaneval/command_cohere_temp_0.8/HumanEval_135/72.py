```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    max_idx = -1
    for idx, cur in enumerate(arr[1:]):
        if cur <= prev:
            max_idx = idx + 1
        prev = cur
    return max_idx
```

The function `can_arrange` uses a loop to iterate through the array, maintaining a variable `prev` which stores the value of the element immediately preceding the current iteration. The variable `max_idx` is initialized to -1, representing the index of the last valid element. As the loop runs through, the current index `idx` is incremented. The loop compares the current element `cur` with the previous one (`prev`). If the current element is less than or equal to the previous one, it means it can be arranged properly, so `max_idx` is updated to the current index. The loop concludes after examining each element, and the index of the last valid element (or -1 if there is no such element) is returned.

Here is a simple test case to verify the functionality of the provided solution:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
expected_result = 3

result = can_arrange(arr)

assert result == expected_result, f"Expected {expected_result}, but got {result}"
```

The assertion here will pass, as the `can_arrange` function will correctly identify the index 3 as the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the one before it.
