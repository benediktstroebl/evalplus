```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    max_idx = -1
    for idx, val in enumerate(arr):
        if val > arr[idx - 1]:
            continue
        max_idx = max(max_idx, idx)
    return max_idx
```

The function `can_arrange` iterates through the array and keeps track of the largest index of a value that is not greater than the preceding element. The loop begins with the second element (`idx = 1`), as the first element can't be greater than the preceding element. The loop will be terminated if a value greater than the previous one is encountered, to ensure that the answer index is not misdirected to a value that may be inserted somewhere in the array but not in the position being considered. The variable `max_idx` is initialized to -1, and it keeps track of the largest index of a value that is not greater than the preceding element.
