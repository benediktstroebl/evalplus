```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    maxi = 0
    for idx, cur in enumerate(arr[1:], start=1):
        if cur > prev:
            return -1
        elif cur >= prev:
            maxi = idx
        prev = cur
    return maxi
```
This Python script defines a function called `can_arrange`, which takes an array (`arr`) as input. It aims to find the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. In other words, it wants to find the largest index of an element that is strictly less than its preceding neighbor. If no such element exists, meaning there are no elements that fit this condition, the function returns -1 as a signal of failure. The function only looks for the answer element in the array's elements following the first one, as the first element obviously cannot have a preceding element better than itself. The logic of the function is to iterate through these subsequent array elements and compare each one to its preceding element. If the current element is less than its preceding neighbor, it is our answer and we find the index of this element; if the current element is equal or worse than its preceding neighbor, we continue on to the next element. The function is also designed to handle arrays with no subsequent elements (i.e. an array with only one element), which is why there is a `start=1` in the `enumerate` loop to skip the first element. Finally, the function is tested with two examples in the docstring, which are also provided as tests in the code block below.

```python
arr1 = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
assert can_arrange(arr1) == 3

arr2 = [1, 2, 3]
assert can_arrange(arr2) == -1
```
These example tests demonstrate the function's behavior with two different arrays, verifying that it produces the correct output.
