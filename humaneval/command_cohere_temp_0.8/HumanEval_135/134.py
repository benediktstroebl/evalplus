```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    prev = arr[0]
    ans = 0
    for idx, cur in enumerate(arr[1:], start=1):
        if cur <= prev:
            continue
        else:
            prev = cur
            ans = idx
    return -1 if ans == 0 else ans
```

The function `can_arrange()` iterates through the list, maintaining two variables: `prev` and `ans`. `prev` stores the value of the element immediately preceding the current iteration, and `ans` stores the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. The loop continues until the end of the list is reached. When the current element is greater than or equal to the previous element, the loop continues to the next iteration without any processing. If the current element is smaller than the previous element, then the answer (idx) is updated if it is larger than the current idx. Finally, the function returns -1 if the variable ans is 0 (no valid arrangement found) or returns the value of ans.
