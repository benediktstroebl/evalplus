```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    res = -1
    for i in range(len(arr)-1):
        if arr[i]<arr[i+1]:
            res = max(res, i)
    return res
```
The function `can_arrange()` is used to find the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. The loop iterates over each index pair `(i, i+1)`, and if the element at index `i` is less than the element at index `i+1`, the maximum index of interest is updated. Finally, the variable `res` is returned, which stores the result as -1 if no suitable element is found, and the largest index of such an element otherwise. 

Here is a sample output of the function:
```
can_arrange([1, 2, 4, 3, 5]) = 3
can_arrange([1, 2, 3]) = -1
```
This demonstrates the function's ability to identify the correct index 3 in the first example, as well as its recognition of the absence of a suitable element in the second example, where it returns -1.
