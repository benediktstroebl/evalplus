The `numerical_letter_grade` function accepts a list of student GPAs and returns a list of corresponding letter grades. It does this by matching each GPA to the closest threshold in the grading table, as it is formatted as a dictionary. Thresholds are organized by letter grade, with each grade representing a list of GPAs that map to that particular grade. The function iterates through each GPA in the input list and, in parallel, cycles through the keys in the grading table. For each GPA, it checks if there's a matching grade in the list for that letter grade, and if so, returns that letter. The `round()` function ensures that GPAs rounded to the fifth decimal match the grades in the table correctly.
