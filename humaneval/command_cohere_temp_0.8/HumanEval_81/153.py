The `numerical_letter_grade` function accepts as input a list of student GPAs and returns a list of corresponding letter grades. It does this by referencing a predefined dictionary that maps a range of GPAs to letter grades. The function uses list comprehensions to determine the letter grade for each student GPA based on this dictionary, considering the GPA distribution across grading tiers. 

The result is a list where each element corresponds to the letter grade for the respective GPA. 

This approach ensures a straightforward and efficient solution, although it might not be the most optimal in terms of code complexity. You can optimize it further by sorting the students based on their GPA and then assigning grades. Nevertheless, the code provided is manageable and fulfills the specified requirements. 

The code includes a docstring that provides a clear problem statement and example, following best practices for Python code. Additionally, the letter grades are rounded to the nearest decimal using the `round` function, which is automatically handled based on the GPA threshold for each tier. 

Overall, the code provides an effective solution to the problem and should serve as a reliable basis for grading student GPAs and producing corresponding letter grades. 

Note: You can improve this code by sorting the students based on their GPA, then assigning grades; this will save computational time as you don't need to search the grades list anymore. Here is a code snippet for an alternative approach:
```python
def numerical_letter_grade(grades):
    """It is the last week of the semester and the teacher has to give the grades
    to students. The teacher has been making her own algorithm for grading.
    The only problem is, she has lost the code she used for grading.
    She has given you a list of GPAs for some students
