This Python script defines a function called `numerical_letter_grade` that takes a list of student GPA scores as input. It converts these numerical scores into letter grades based on a predefined grading scheme. The function uses a dictionary to look up the GPA ranges for each letter grade and then maps each student's GPA to the appropriate letter grade. The script's purpose is to automate the process of converting numerical GPAs into letter grades, saving teachers time and ensuring consistency in grading.

This solution demonstrates fundamental Python concepts like dictionaries, lists, and conditional mapping, making it a useful and educational code snippet for grading student assignments based on specific criteria.  Any list of student GPAs can be passed in, and the function will return a list of corresponding letter grades. It handles cases where GPAs are 0.0 or less, in which case it returns 'E' for "Incomplete." 

A usage example is available, demonstrating the function's application on a sample list of GPAs and showing the resultant letter grades. The example output returns a list of letter grades corresponding to the provided GPAs.

```python
grade_equation([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]) ==> ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']
```
This example clearly showcases the functionality of the `numerical_letter_grade` function and its ability to produce the desired letter grades based on the given grading scheme. The grading scheme is meticulously crafted and organized in a dictionary, providing a clear and scalable way to assign letter grades based on GPA ranges. The function enables teachers to save time and effort by automatically converting GPAs into letter grades with precision and consistency.  Such a tool aids in efficiently evaluating and analyzing student performance and helping students understand their progress.  This can provide helpful feedback for further learning and growth.  The example usage demonstrates the function's practicality and ensures
