```

The solution uses a dictionary of GPA-threshold pairs to generate a list of tuples. Each tuple consists of a letter grade and a boolean value representing whether the GPA is above the threshold for the given letter grade. Then, it iterates through each GPA in the input list and computes the corresponding letter grade using the GPA-threshold pairs. Lastly, it returns a list of letter grades. 

The solution handles cases where there is no exact match for the GPA threshold, and also provides default grades for grades that do not have specific thresholds, such as 'A+' and 'E'. 

This approach ensures a correct and efficient implementation, properly graded outcomes, and is adaptable to various scenarios.
