The task is to create a function that takes a list of student GPAs and returns a list of letter grades for each student based on the above grading scale. The function uses a dictionary to map a range of GPAs to letters and then returns the appropriate letter for each student's GPA. 

The provided code works as expected and corresponds to the problem statement. You can test the function by calling it with a list of student GPAs, and it will return a list of letter grades for each student. 

This code defines a function `numerical_letter_grade` that takes in a list of student GPAs as input and returns a list of letter grades for each student based on the given grading scale. 

You can test the function by calling it with a list of student GPAs, and it will return a list of letter grades for each student. 

For example:
```python
print(numerical_letter_grade([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]))
```
Will output:
```
['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']
```

However, if you place an execution point at the end of the script (e.g. by typing `>>>`), you can see the code failing the test, as the example grade_equation function is expecting a list of strings as output, whereas our function above is returning a list of floats. 

To fix it, we can use `round()` to convert the float values to integers and use the index notation again, as per the original example:
```python
def numerical_letter_grade(grades):
    letter_grades = {
        'A+': [4.0, 3.95, 3.9, 3.85, 3.8],
        'A': [3.75, 3.7, 3.65,
