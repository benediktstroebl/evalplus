The code defines a Python function called `numerical_letter_grade` that takes a list of student GPA grades as input. It translates these numerical grades into letter grades based on a predefined key-value map. The key-value map establishes a range of GPA scores for each letter grade, including half-grade thresholds. The function iterates through each GPA grade in the input list and searches the key-value map for the corresponding letter grade range. It uses Python's round() function to round each GPA to the nearest threshold within its letter grade range. Finally, it returns a list of letter grades for each student based on their input GPAs, resulting in a list like ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-'] for the provided example GPAs. 

Here is a breakdown of the code:
- The `letter_grades` dictionary maps letter grades to GPA ranges using nested dictionaries. This structure allows you to retrieve the GPA thresholds for a specific letter grade. 
- The function iterates through each element in the input list of grades with the for grade in grades loop. 
- For each grade, it checks if the letter grade is present in the `letter_grades` dictionary using the key grade in letter_grades if grade in letter_grades. 
- If the grade is present, it rounds the grade to the nearest threshold within its letter grade range using round(grade). 
- Finally, it returns a list of letter grades for each student based on their input GPAs. 

You can alter the `letter_grades` dictionary to accommodate different grading scales or customize the grading thresholds. The code is designed to be easily modifiable to adapt to specific requirements or changes in grading policies.
