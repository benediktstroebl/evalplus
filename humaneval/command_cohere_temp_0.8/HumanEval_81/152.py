The `numerical_letter_grade` function accepts as input a list of student GPAs and returns a list of corresponding letter grades. It utilizes a dictionary that lists GPA ranges and their respective letter grades to determine the correct grade for each student based on the closest grade range. The function works for both uppercase and lowercase grades and is tested for edge cases. 

Let's break down the solution into components for clarity:
1. **Dictionary of Letter Grades**: The solution begins with a dictionary that maps a range of GPAs to letter grades, with each GPA range corresponding to a specific letter grade. This is the core logic that the teacher has lost, but which you have recovered through careful analysis of the problem statement.
2. **Mapping the Grades**: The function `numerical_letter_grade` takes student GPAs as input. It sorts the GPA ranges from the dictionary above based on the maximum GPA among the students. This is done by finding the key with the highest GPA in the sorted list of keys.
    - Then, it iterates over the GPAs of the students and, for each, finds the closest letter grade range using the bisect algorithm. This is where the logic deviates from a pure dictionary lookup. 
    - The `bisect` algorithm helps find the closest GPA range,
