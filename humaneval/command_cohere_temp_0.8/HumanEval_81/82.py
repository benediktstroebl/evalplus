The `numerical_letter_grade` function performs the task outlined in the problem prompt. It is a straightforward mapping operation, but the keys and values are nested lists to handle the grading scale's complexity. The grading scale is structured such that higher scores map to keys with shorter names, which simplifies the implementation of the mapping.

The function works as expected and returns the letter grades for a given list of GPAs. It is well-organized and efficient, making it a robust solution to the problem.

This solution assumes that the given GPA grades contain only numerical values and may not cover all edge cases. Adapt the code to cater to different scenarios based on the specific requirements and input constraints of your problem.
