The task is to create a function that takes a list of student GPAs and returns a list of letter grades for each student, using the specific grading scale provided. The solution uses a dictionary to map a range of GPA values to letters for each letter grade. It then loops through the input GPA list, uses the dictionary to find the correct letter grade for each GPA, and returns the result. Any GPA value not specifically mapped to a letter grade defaults to 'F'. 

The provided code is fully self-contained and should run without any issues. It includes the function `numerical_letter_grade` that takes a list of student GPAs and returns a list of letter grades. The unit tests and main function are also included, making it ready to run. When executed, it will output:
```python
grade_equation([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]) ==> ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']
```

Which is the expected result based on the provided problem statement.
