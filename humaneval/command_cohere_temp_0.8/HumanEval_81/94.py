The `numerical_letter_grade` function accepts a list of student GPAs and returns a list of letter grades based on the GPA ranges defined in the provided table. It uses a dictionary with `GPAs` as keys and lists of letter grades as values. Each letter grade is associated with a range of GPAs defined by two values indicating the minimum and maximum GPA required for that letter grade. The function iterates through the GPA values, and for each, it finds the appropriate letter grade using the `get` method of the dictionary, which returns the list of letter grades with the `or` syntax applied to check if the GPA of a student is equal to or higher than the minimum value of a GPA range and lower than the maximum value of that range. The resulting list of letter grades is then returned by the function.
