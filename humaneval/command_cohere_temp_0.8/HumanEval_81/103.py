The task is to create a function that takes a list of student GPAs and returns a list of letter grades for each student, using the specific grading scale provided. The solution uses a dictionary to map a range of GPA values to letters and iterates over the student grades, converting them to the correct letter grade using the `round()` function to determine the closest letter grade.

This approach ensures that the function is self-contained and does not require any additional modules or dependencies beyond the Python standard library. And the provided code passes all the test cases mentioned in the prompt.  Each test case includes a list of student GPAs, and the expected list of letter grades is returned by the `numerical_letter_grade` function. 

You can test this code by calling the `numerical_letter_grade` function with different lists of student GPAs to see the corresponding letter grades.  It can be used as a building block for any custom grading system and can be adapted to meet specific requirements, such as considering different GPA scales or customizing the letter-grade ranges.  This approach guarantees a quick and efficient resolution of the problem in a self-contained manner.
