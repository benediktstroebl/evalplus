```

The code uses a dictionary to map from numerical GPAs to letter grades, with the GPA range for each letter grade stored in list form in the dictionary keys. The grades list is then iterated through, and for each grade, the key for the list in which the grade belongs is found, and the corresponding letter grade is returned after rounding the GPA to one decimal place using Python's built-in `round` function. The code then returns a list of these computed letter grades. 

The code's approach allows for a concise and readable solution that is easy to understand, making it a robust and efficient implementation for the given problem.
