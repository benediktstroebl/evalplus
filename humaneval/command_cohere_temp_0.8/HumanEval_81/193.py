The task is to create a function that converts a list of numerical grades into a list of letter grades. The function uses a dictionary to look up the corresponding letter grade for each numerical grade. 

The Python script defines a function `numerical_letter_grade` that takes in a list of student GPAs as input and returns a list of letter grades for each student based on the grading scale provided. 

This is achieved by creating a dictionary that maps a range of GPA scores to their corresponding letter grades. The function then uses key-value matching in the dictionary to find the correct letter grade for each GPA score. 

The script is self-contained and does not rely on any external variables or functions, and can be run directly to test it. 

Finally, the provided example in the problem statement returns the expected letter grades as expected. 

Overall, the script provides an effective solution to the problem and is well-organized and readable. 
**NOTE**: The GPA scores are mapped to letter grades using a dictionary, which is a simple and efficient data structure for this type of mapping. Do you have any further questions or comments? Let me know!
