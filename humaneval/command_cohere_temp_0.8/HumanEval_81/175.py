The task is to create a function that converts a list of numerical grades into a list of letter grades. Letter grades are defined by threshold values with specific ranges that correspond to each letter grade. The challenge is to write a function that takes a list of numerical grades as input and returns a list of letter grades corresponding to each input grade.

The solution uses a dictionary to map threshold values to letter grades, and a list of functions to round grades and filter out the correct letter grades. The list of functions is applied to each grade in the input list, and the results are concatenated into a single list. This approach minimizes code duplication and makes the code more efficient and easier to maintain. 

To ensure the accuracy and correctness of the approach, the script also includes test cases that cover different scenarios. These test cases help to validate the functionality of the `numerical_letter_grade` function and ensure that it performs the desired grade conversion accurately and properly. 
Let's take a detailed look at the code after its breakdown: 
```python
def numerical_letter_grade(grades):
    """
    Convert numerical grades to letter grades based on thresholds
    """
    # Define letter grade ranges and mapping
    letter_grades = {
        'A+': [4.0, 3.95, 3.9, 3.85, 3.8],
        'A': [3.7, 3.65, 3.6, 3.55, 3.5],
        'A-': [3.3, 3.25, 3.2, 3.15, 3.0],
        # ... (other letter grades)
        'D-': [0.3, 0.25, 0.2, 0.15, 0.0],
        'E': [0.0, 0.0, 0.
