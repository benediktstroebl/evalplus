The `numerical_letter_grade` function accepts a list of student GPAs and returns a list of corresponding letter grades. It does this by rounding each GPA and checking which letter grade bucket the rounded GPA falls into. The function consults a dictionary where the keys are the letter grades and the values are lists of GPAs that correspond to those letters. The function iterates through the student GPAs, and for each GPA, it checks which letter grade bucket it falls into and adds that letter grade to the output list. The output list is then returned.

The output list ensures that all the grades are sorted in increasing order. Also, the function only evaluates to true for the first grade that is matched, so it will pick the first matching grade from the buckets the GPA falls into. 

This approach improves efficiency as we only iterate over the student grades once and have a more concise and readable implementation that is easier to extend if we want to add more grading criteria in the future. 

The `grade_equation` function is not necessary, and the unit tests correctly verify the functionality of the `numerical_letter_grade` function with example inputs. 

This solution is efficient for small lists of grades but could still benefit from optimization if handling a large number of grades.
