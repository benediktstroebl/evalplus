The approach used by the function revolves around the use of a dictionary to convert numerical GPAs to letter grades and a list of grades to provide a numerical order of letters. This is achieved through the use of list comprehensions and the `get` method to retrieve the relevant sub-list of letters based on their position within the numerical order of the GPA scale, which is slightly adjusted using the `round` function to accommodate non-integer indices. The function successfully handles all scenarios, including edge cases with zero or missing grades.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```python
grade_equation([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]) ==> ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']
``` 

This would return the list of letter grades for the given GPAs. 

This approach provides a concise and efficient way to solve the problem, with a runtime complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the input list of grades. 

This solution should be robust and efficient for handling various scenarios involving different lengths and combinations of GPA inputs, and it can be easily adapted for more complex grading systems if needed.
