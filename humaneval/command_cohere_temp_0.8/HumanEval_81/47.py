The `numerical_letter_grade` function accepts a list of student GPAs and returns a list of corresponding letter grades. It does so by utilizing a dictionary that maps a range of GPAs to each letter grade, with the highest GPA in each range acting as a threshold for that grade. For each GPA in the input list, it iterates through the GPA ranges and their corresponding letter grades to find the appropriate letter grade for that GPA, and returns a list of letter grades accordingly.  It's important to note that the GPA ranges and thresholds used in this function are specific to the provided table and may not align with any standardized grading system, hence, it is crucial to ensure the GPAs are entered correctly to ensure accurate results.  This script passes the provided test case as well as a suggested additional test case. 

You can test the function by calling `numerical_letter_grade([3.8, 2.2, 1.9])`, which should return `['A', 'C', 'D']`. 

This approach provides a functional and efficient solution to the problem, allowing for the conversion of student GPAs into letter grades based on the provided grading table.  If you encounter any issues or have recommended improvements, feel free to discuss further!
