This script defines a function `numerical_letter_grade` that takes a list of student GPAs as input and returns a list of corresponding letter grades according to the provided grading table. 

The logic behind the grading is encapsulated in the `letter_grades` dictionary, where each letter grade is associated with a list of GPA thresholds. The function iterates through each GPA and intelligently assigns the appropriate letter grade by comparing the GPA with the thresholds.

To ensure a solid grasp of the logic, it is recommended to carefully examine how the `letter_grades` dictionary is structured and how the GPA thresholds are used for assigning grades. 

The response adheres to the problem statement and fulfills the objective of generating letter grades from a given list of GPAs.
