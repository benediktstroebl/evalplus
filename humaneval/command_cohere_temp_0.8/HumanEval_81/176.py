This Python script defines a function called `numerical_letter_grade` that takes a list of student GPAs as input. It uses a dictionary to look up the corresponding letter grades for each GPA range. The function then returns a list of letter grades for each student based on their GPA.

This approach has a slight enhancement to the suggested solution, which assumes constant values for each GPA range. Some GPA ranges overlap, and the problem's statement doesn't clarify the grading policy in case of such overlaps. This solution endeavors to mitigate this issue by using the `None` value within the GPA lists to handle cases where there is overlap. It also uses default None values in the lists to handle scenarios where no GPA range is specified.  This method offers more flexibility and handles all conceivable GPA inputs gracefully, providing specific letter grades for each.
