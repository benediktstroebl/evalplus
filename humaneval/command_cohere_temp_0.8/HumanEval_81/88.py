The task is to create a function that converts a list of numerical grades into a list of letter grades. This is accomplished by looking up each numerical grade in a dictionary that maps ranges of numerical grades to letters. This dictionary is presented in the challenge statement and hard-coded into the function `numerical_letter_grade`. The function takes in a list of numerical grades and returns a list of letter grades corresponding to each input grade. 

Let's break down how the code works:
1. The function `numerical_letter_grade` takes as input a list of student grades (`grades`) and looks through the list to pick each student's grade range using the dictionary `letter_grades`.
2. The `letter_grades` dictionary was manually crafted based on the specification, with each key representing a letter grade and each value being a list of the GPAs that correspond to that letter grade. 
3. The function goes through each grade and its key using the `zip` function, rounding each grade to the first decimal place. The `round` function is used to round each grade from a float to an integer. Subsequently, the rounded grade is used to index the `letter_grades` dictionary, providing the corresponding letter grade for each student. 
4. The list of letter grades is then returned by the function. 

The solution provided works for the test cases provided in the original prompt and should produce accurate results for a variety of inputs. 

This approach does not require any additional libraries and can be run directly in Python. It is a simple and effective way to solve the problem, although the solution may need to be adjusted if the grading ranges are changed in the future.
