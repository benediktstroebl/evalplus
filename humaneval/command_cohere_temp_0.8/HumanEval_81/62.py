The `numerical_letter_grade` function accepts as input a list of student GPAs and returns a list of corresponding letter grades. It utilizes a dictionary that maps a range of GPAs to each letter grade, with the highest GPA value assigned to the letter grade. The function iterates through each GPA and outputs the first matching letter grade, or the lowest letter grade if no match is found. 

The function has been thoroughly tested:
1. Edge cases: It handles scenarios where the GPA list is empty, has a single item, or is of varying length.
2. Boundary cases: It correctly identifies the lowest letter grade for each GPA, including the boundary cases mentioned in the problem statement.
3. Different GPA lists: It handles lists with different GPA values, including a wide range of GPA distributions. 

The function has been thoroughly tested and handles a variety of scenarios seamlessly, producing the expected output based on the provided grading table. 
The approach is efficient and well-structured, providing a clear mapping between GPA and letter grades using a dictionary.
