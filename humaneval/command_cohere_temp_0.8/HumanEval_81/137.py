The task is to create a function that converts a list of numerical grades into a list of letter grades. Letter grades are defined by the GPA range they represent in the provided table. The function `numerical_letter_grade()` takes a list of student grades as input and uses a dictionary of GPA ranges to convert each grade into its corresponding letter grade. Each GPA range is associated with a list of GPA values that fall within it. The function iterates through each grade in the input list, and for each grade, it finds the closest range according to a given algorithm and returns the corresponding letter grade.

The Python script defines a function `numerical_letter_grade()` that takes in a list of student GPAs as input and returns a list of letter grades corresponding to each GPA based on the predefined table of GPA ranges and letter grades. This function is then tested against a test case to check if the function correctly converts the given example GPAs into the corresponding letter grades. 

The script passes the test because the function `numerical_letter_grade()` correctly returns the expected output of ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-'] based on the given GPAs [4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]. 

Below is the bash script to execute the given python script and tests:
```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_numerical_letter_grade
```
The output should be:
```bash

The internal working of the function `numerical_letter_grade()` is as follows:
- It uses a dictionary `letter_grades` that maps letter grades to a range of GPA values.
- Each GPA range
