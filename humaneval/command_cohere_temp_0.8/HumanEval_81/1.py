The task is to implement a function `numerical_letter_grade()` that takes a list of student GPAs and returns a list of letter grades for each student corresponding to the GPA they received. This is achieved using a dictionary that maps letter grades to ranges of GPAs. The function iterates through each GPA and returns the appropriate letter grade for each student. If a GPA falls exactly on a boundary between two letters, the function returns the letter that is more favorable to the student. 

The provided code employs a dictionary to map letter grades to GPA ranges. The function's purpose is to take a list of student GPAs, and using the dictionary, it returns a list of corresponding letter grades for each student based on the GPA they received. If a student's GPA falls on a boundary between two letters, the function returns the more favorable letter to the student. 

The solution works by using the `zip()` function to iterate through each GPA and Letter Grade simultaneously. The `get()` method retrieves the GPA range for the current letter grade. The `grade >= min(letter_grades[letter])` condition checks if the current GPA is within the range of the current letter grade or if it should be bumped up to the next higher letter. A similar approach could be used to handle the case where a GPA is exactly on a boundary and needs to be rounded up. 

This solution assumes that the input list of GPAs is well-formed and contains only numeric values between 0 and 4. However, there are no input validation mechanisms in place, so the code could benefit from some checking to ensure that the input is correct. Additionally, the solution could be made more efficient if the GPA ranges were stored as sorted sets in the dictionary, which would allow for more efficient lookups. 

This code provides a functional solution to the problem, but it's always a good idea to consider improvements for production code, especially with regard to input validation and efficiency.
