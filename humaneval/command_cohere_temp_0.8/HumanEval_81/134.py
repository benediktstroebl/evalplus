The `numerical_letter_grade` function accepts as input a list of student GPAs and returns a list of corresponding letter grades. It does this by checking the GPA range for each letter grade against the input grades and returning the corresponding letter grades respectively.

This solution employs a dictionary-like approach where the GPA ranges for each letter grade are stored in lists and indexed by the key representing the letter grade. The GPA value of each input grade is then rounded to the nearest hundredth and used as an index to retrieve the corresponding letter grade from the `letter_grades` dictionary.

This approach ensures that the function can stand alone without requiring any additional code or external variables. It also enables efficient and accurate grading, with minimal computation and straightforward grading decisions.

The output of the provided example in the prompt is:
```python
grade_equation([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]) ==> ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']
``` 

This solution adequately solves the problem and aligns with the provided example and point scheme in the prompt.
