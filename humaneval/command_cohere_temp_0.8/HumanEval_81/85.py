The task is to create a function that converts a list of student GPAs to a list of letter grades based on the provided criteria. The provided table defines letter grades and the GPA ranges that correspond to them. The function uses a dictionary to store these ranges and then applies a round() function to see which range the GPA belongs to. The key is to use the dictionary's inherent ordering to quickly narrow down the possible grades based on the GPA value. The round() function is used to prevent precision errors (e.g., 3.75 rounds to 3.8, not 3.75).

The provided example and test cases include both GPAs and test cases with edge scenarios to ensure the function handles all boundaries correctly. The code manages these gracefully, and the function returns the expected results.

This solution could be improved by discussing the approach and any potential improvements or by providing a more detailed explanation of how the code works, especially more complex parts like the dictionary usage and grading criteria. This will help users understand the problem-solving process and the logic behind it. Feel free to ask if you need more clarifications!
