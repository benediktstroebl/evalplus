The `numerical_letter_grade` function accepts as input a list of student grades and returns a list of corresponding letter grades. It utilizes a dictionary where each key represents a letter grade and the value is a list of GPA thresholds for that letter grade. Each student's GPA is iterated through and their grade is rounded to find the closest threshold to determine the letter grade. The function is designed to handle scenarios where there are no students with grades below D- or zero, which aligns with the problem's given table structure. 

This approach allows the function to handle various GPA data with ease. However, it is important to maintain the dictionary with up-to-date thresholds to ensure accurate grading calculations. 

The code includes an example test case to help you understand how to utilize the function and can be added to within the same script to test a variety of scenarios. 

Note that the grading thresholds in the dictionary are based on the problem's given table and may not align with any specific grading system in reality. Adjusting the thresholds allows you to customize the function to meet different grading standards. 

To maintain the code and ensure accurate results, periodically update the grading thresholds in the dictionary based on grading standards and any adjustments made to grading criteria over time.
