The `numerical_letter_grade` function accepts as input a list of student GPAs and returns a list of corresponding letter grades. It utilizes a dictionary that maps a range of GPA values to specific letter grades. For each student GPA in the input list, the function checks the dictionary to find the closest matching letter grade based on the GPA ranges. The `round()` function ensures precision, potentially favoring the student with a slight GPA deviation. 

Let's take the `grade_equation` function with the input `[4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]` as an example. Here's how it would be executed:
```python
grade_equation = numerical_letter_grade([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5])
print(grade_equation)
```

Output:
```
['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']
```

This result is obtained as follows:
- The GPA `4.0` falls within the range of the `A+` grade, which assigns this grade for grades `>= 3.8`.
- The GPA `3` falls somewhat below the threshold for `A+`, `A`, or `A-`, qualifying for a `B+` grade.
- The GPA `1.7` is at the bottom of the spectrum, earning a `C-` grade.
- The GPA `2` lies around the boundary of `B+` and `B`, resulting in a `B` grade.
- Lastly, the GPA `3.5` is within the range for an `A-` grade.

Note that this solution assumes that the list of grades is sorted in ascending order. If the list is not sorted, the resulting letter grades may not be accurate. It is also important to note that this function does not handle scenarios where the input list contains grades that are not numbers, as these
