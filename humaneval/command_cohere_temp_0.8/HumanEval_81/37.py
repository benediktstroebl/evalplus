The `numerical_letter_grade` function accepts as input a list of student GPAs and returns a list of corresponding letter grades based on the GPA ranges specified in the provided table. Using the `zip` function, each GPA is compared to the minimum GPA for each letter grade, and the respective letter grade is selected using the `get` method of the `letter_grades` dictionary. The function passes the test case provided in the problem statement, with the expected output matching the input grades and letter grades exactly.  The code includes additional tests to ensure proper functionality of the function.  The `letter_grades` dictionary maps letter grades to corresponding GPA ranges, with each entry representing a specific letter grade and the corresponding GPA thresholds. 

You can adjust the GPA thresholds for each letter grade in the `letter_grades` dictionary to customize the grading scale according to your preferences.  This approach eliminates the need for a separate loop and reduces the code's complexity, making it more concise, efficient, and easier to understand at a glance.  It is important to ensure that the GPA thresholds for each letter grade are correctly set to match the grading scale used in your specific context, as these values are customizable and dependent on the problem requirements.  The output of the example usage is also provided, which demonstrates the correct mapping of GPAs to letter grades based on the specified thresholds.  This helps verify the accuracy of the implemented solution.  It is important to include tests that cover different scenarios, including edge cases and boundary conditions, to ensure the robustness and accuracy of the grading algorithm.  This helps to ensure that the function behaves as
