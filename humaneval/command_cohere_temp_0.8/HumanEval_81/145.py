The task is to create a function that converts a list of numerical grades into a list of letter grades. The function uses a dictionary to look up the list of letter grades for each numerical grade. The function then loops through each grade in the input list and returns the corresponding letter grade. If the input list contains a grade that is not in the dictionary, it defaults to an 'F' value.

Let's break down the approach:
1. A dictionary `letter_grades` is created with the numerical GPA ranges as keys, and their corresponding letter grades as values. 
2. The function `numerical_letter_grade()` takes in a list of student `grades` as input.
3. For each `grade` encountered, the function uses the `letter_grades` dictionary to look up the corresponding letter grade. If the `grade` falls within a GPA range, that letter grade is used. The `round()` function is used to round fractions up or down to the nearest whole number. 
4. Finally, the function returns a list of the converted letter grades for each student. 

This solution assumes that the teacher's algorithm only considers the one decimal point precision of the GPA values when assigning letter grades. Therefore any GPA values like 3.6 and 3.64 will both correspond to the letter grade 'A'. It's also worth noting that the solution could be optimized to be more efficient with the use of a single list comprehension. Instead of iterating over the `grades` list twice, we can combine both iterations into one loop. 

This solution has been tested with the provided example in the problem description, and the output was as expected. The function should work for a variety of inputs and edge cases according to the problem statement.
