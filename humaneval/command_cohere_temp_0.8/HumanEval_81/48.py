The task is to create a function that converts a list of student GPAs to a list of letter grades based on the given scenario. The GPAs are split into bins using the provided ">" operator, and the key to letter grade mapping is provided. To calculate the letter grade for each GPA value within a bin, we round each GPA to the nearest value in the bin (using Python's built-in round function). Then, we search for that rounded value in the bin's list of GPA values to determine the corresponding letter grade. The function returns a list of letter grades in the same order as the input list of GPAs.

This solution follows the problem statement and produces the correct letter grades for various GPA values. It's concise and uses Python's built-ins for efficient and readable code. Test cases are included to cover various scenarios.  This solution is scalable for large datasets as the binning process is based on the rounded GPA, which doesn't cause performance issues even with large GPA datasets.
