The `numerical_letter_grade` function accepts as an input a list of student grades and returns a list of corresponding letter grades. It utilizes a dictionary of grade ranges and their respective letter grades to determine the correct letter grade for each student grade. 

The `letter_grades` dictionary includes letter grades and the GPA ranges associated with them. The function uses this dictionary to map each student's GPA to the corresponding letter grade. 

Then, the function returns a list of these letter grades in the same order as the input list of student grades. And, if there is no specific threshold for a particular letter grade, it will not be included in the resultant list. 

For instance, the letter grade 'F' is absent from the dictionary, and therefore, in the result of the function, lists without any F grades will include only 7 letters of the English alphabet. 

The provided example in the problem statement would result in ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-'], which accurately reflects the letter grades corresponding to the given GPA scores using the algorithm. 

This solution has been tested and is working correctly, preparing students for their semester ahead!
