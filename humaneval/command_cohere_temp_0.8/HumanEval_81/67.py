The `numerical_letter_grade` function accepts as input a list of student GPAs and returns a list of corresponding letter grades for each student. It utilizes a dictionary that maps letter grades to ranges of GPAs to determine the correct letter grade for each student based on their GPA. 

The script tests the function using a variety of GPA inputs to ensure that it returns the correct letter grades for each student.  For example, the function is tested with the input `[4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]` and is expected to return `['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']`. 
The test cases are written using python's built-in `assert` statement to facilitate debugging in case of failure.  This approach helps to continuously improve the accuracy and reliability of the function with minimal human intervention.  It also abstracts the complex mapping logic, making the function easier to maintain and update with new data in the future.  Finally, using `zip` allows the use of a single dictionary lookup per student GPA, which improves the function's efficiency. 

It is important to note, however, that this solution is not optimal in terms of code readability and maintainability. The use of a dictionary literal with a ternary operator as keys is a controversial approach and it's important to consider the alternative of using separate dictionary items for each letter grade range. This could also make it easier to expand the solution should additional letter grades or GPA ranges be introduced in the future.  Also,
