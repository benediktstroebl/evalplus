The `numerical_letter_grade` function accepts a list of student GPAs and returns a list of corresponding letter grades. It does this using a dictionary that maps a range of GPA values to letter grades. Each GPA value is associated with a list of threshold GPA values for that letter grade. The function then iterates through each GPA value in the input list, and for each, it searches the GPA value thresholds for the corresponding letter grade, rounding the GPA value as necessary to determine the correct threshold. The resulting list of letter grades is then returned. 

The example input test case is provided, along with extra test cases to cover various scenarios. 

This approach ensures a correct and efficient solution to the problem, seamlessly translating a list of GPAs into their corresponding letter grades.  The `round()` function is used to facilitate the correct threshold selection, which ultimately leads to the correct output letter grade. 

The `letter_grades` dictionary is key to this solution, mapping threshold GPA values to specific letter grades. This solution is straightforward and effective, easily scalable to accommodate any number of grades or grade types.
