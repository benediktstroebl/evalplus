The `numerical_letter_grade` function accepts as an argument a list of student GPAs and returns a list of corresponding letter grades. It does this by matching each GPA to the closest threshold in the grading table, which is computed using Python's built-in `round` function, and then returning the appropriate key letter grade from the grading table. This approach ensures that the function handles a wide range of GPA inputs and delivers accurate letter grades for each.

Letter grades are specified in the grading table as keys like 'A+' and corresponding lists of GPAs as values. The GPAs are rounded to the nearest decimal to simulate a teacher's subjective grading, which could have some variability. Finally, the function goes through each GPA in the input list and returns a list of letter grades accordingly. The result is a list of letter grades appropriately assigned to each student GPA.
