The task is to create a function that takes a list of student GPAs and returns a list of letter grades for those scores using the specified grading table.

The provided code uses a dictionary to store the GPA and Letter Grade mapping. The function loops through the student grades and for each grade, it checks if it's above or equal to the lowest GPA of the assigned letter grade, it finds the corresponding letter grade for that GPA and returns a list of letter grades in order. It also handles scenarios where there's no grade assigned to a particular GPA (e.g., 4.1). In this case, the function will return the default 'E'.  The code successfully passes the test case provided in the prompt. 

To test the function, you can call the `numerical_letter_grade()` function with a list of student GPAs as shown in the example below:
```python
print(numerical_letter_grade([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]))
```
Which will output:
```
['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']
```
This output corresponds to the example provided in the problem statement. 
Remember to install the necessary Python packages to run the code successfully:
```
pip install coverage coveralls
```
