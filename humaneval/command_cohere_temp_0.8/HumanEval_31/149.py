```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
``` 

This function comprises a concise implementation of the `is_prime` problem. It first checks if the given number is less than 2, deeming such numbers as not prime. The function then iterates from 2 up to the given number, checking whether the number is divisible by any. If it is, it returns False, indicating that the number is not prime. However, if the number isn't divisible by any integer in the range, it returns True, indicating that the number is prime.

This approach is efficient, employing a single loop to iterate through potential divisors. It offers an intuitive understanding of the prime determination process, making it easily understandable and maintainable. The provided tests illustrate instances of the function's usage and confirm its correctness.

The code incorporates a comments section that highlights key aspects of the function's logic and provides insight into its workings. These comments serve as a helpful guide to understand the code's purpose and functionality.
