Here's a Python script with a self-contained function `is_prime` that solves the problem:
```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

This function checks if a given number is prime or not. It first checks if the number is less than 2, returning `False` if so. Then, it iterates from 2 to the square root of the number, checking whether the number is divisible by any integer in this range. If the number is divisible by any of these integers, it returns `False`. If it is not, it returns `True`.

This code incorporates the relevant tests from the provided example, ensuring the function behaves as expected for the given test cases. You can import this function into your code or use it as a standalone tool to quickly check if a number is prime. 

You can use it in the following way:
```python
# Check if prime
print(is_prime(61))
# Prints True

print(is_prime(13441))
# Prints True

print(is_prime(6))
# Prints False

print(is_prime(4))
# Prints False
``` 

This will output:
```bash
True
True
False
False
```
