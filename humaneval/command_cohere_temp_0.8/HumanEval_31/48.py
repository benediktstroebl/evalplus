```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
``` 

This function defines a recursive function `is_prime` that checks if a given number `n` is prime or not. It does this by iterating through the numbers from 2 to `n` inclusive and checking if `n` is divisible by any of them. If it is, then `n` is not prime, and the function returns `False`. If it is not, then the function returns `True`. 

This solution passes the given tests because the provided code snippet implements the specification given in the prompt, namely:
- For the first test of the `is_prime` function with the input of 6, the function returns False since 6 is not a prime number.
- For the second test with the input of 101, the function returns True since 101 is a prime number.
- For the third test with the input of 11, the function returns True since 11 is a prime number.
- For the fourth test with the input of 13441, the function returns True since 13441 is a prime number.
- For the fifth test with the input of 61, the function returns True since 61 is a prime number.
- For the sixth test with the input of 4, the function returns False since 4 is not a prime number.
- For the seventh test with the input of 1, the function returns False since 1 is not a prime number. 
All the test cases correspond to a valid prime number or a composite number, correctly identifying each of them as such. GCD and LI do not play a role in this function, as the specification is solely based on divisibility checks.

Overall, the provided code correctly implements the problem's requirements and satisfies the given tests.
