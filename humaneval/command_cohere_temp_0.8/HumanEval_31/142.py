Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

This function checks if a given number is prime or not. It first checks if the given number is less than 2, returning False if so. It then iterates from 2 up to the square root of the number, checking whether the number is divisible by any other number. If the number is divisible by any other number in this range, it returns False. However, if the number is not divisible by any number in this range, it returns True, indicating that the number is prime.

This approach is efficient as it eliminates the need for checking divisibility for a large number of integers. It reduces the complexity of the algorithm and improves the performance, making it more efficient for prime checking.
