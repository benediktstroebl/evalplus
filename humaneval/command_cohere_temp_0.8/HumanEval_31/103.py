Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

This function defines a logical and efficient algorithm to determine whether a given number n is prime. It begins by handling the special case of n being less than 2, ensuring that attention is paid to the precision of floating-point numbers, and then checks for the possibility of even divisors up to the square root of n. If no divisors are found after this careful investigation, it confirms n as a prime number, returning True. This method efficiently handles potential issues with float precision and provides an intuitive approach to testing primality. 

Here's an example of how to use the function:
```python
>>> is_prime(6)
False
>>> is_prime(101)
True
>>> is_prime(11)
True
>>> is_prime(13441)
True
>>> is_prime(61)
True
>>> is_prime(4)
False
>>> is_prime(1)
False
```

This demonstrates the function's behavior and its expected outputs as outlined in the problem statement.
