Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

This function defines a logic hierarchy to verify if a number is prime. It first checks if the number is smaller than 2, in which case it is not prime. Then, it iterates through integers ranging from 2 up to the square root of the input number, checking for divisibility. If the number is divisible by any integer within this range, it is not prime. However, if no divisors are found, the number is prime, hence the function returns True.

This approach leverages an optimized technique known as the `Sieve of Eratosthenes`, which significantly reduces the number of divisibility checks required for prime determination, resulting in improved performance and efficiency.

This function can solve the problem and pass the given tests, as it matches the specification provided.
