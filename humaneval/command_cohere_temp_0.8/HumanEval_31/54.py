```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

This function covers all edge cases mentioned in the problem statement, including numbers below 2, perfect squares, and numbers that are divisible by themselves.
