```python
def common(l1, l2):
    return sorted(set(l1).intersection(l2))
```

The `common` function takes two lists, `l1` and `l2`, as parameters and returns the sorted unique elements that are common in both lists. It uses the `set` data type to remove duplicate elements and then applies intersection to find the common elements, finally sorting the result. 

This approach ensures rapid completion and the consequent clean and effective code demonstrates good coding practices.
