```python
def common(l1, l2):
    return sorted(set(l1).intersection(l2))
```

The `set` function is used to remove duplicate elements from both lists, and `intersection` returns elements that appear in both lists. Lastly, `sorted` is applied to maintain the sorted order of common elements. The code is concise and efficient in solving the challenge.
