    Args:

    """
    words = sentence.split()

This function `is_prime` checks whether a number is prime or not, and `words_in_sentence` uses it to extract words from a sentence that have prime lengths and then returns a string containing only those prime-length words.

Here is an example usage of the words_in_sentence function:
```python
print(words_in_sentence("Let's go for swimming")) # Output: 'go for'
``` 

And here is a more thorough example to demonstrate the primality testing:
```python
print(is_prime(41))
print(is_prime(40))
print(is_prime(42))
``` 

The output will be:
```
True
False
False
``` 

This demonstrates that the `is_prime` function accurately detects prime numbers.  Considering the varied ways in which primes can be invoked in the dataset, the prime checking mechanism is particularly crucial for this problem.  This also demonstrates the utility of the `is_prime` function in the `words_in_sentence` function.  Such a testing scenario could be beneficial for primality testing functions as well.  This will ensure that they are both accurate and efficient for a variety of scenarios.  This can aid in detecting primes as well as troubleshooting any potential issues that may arise in other problem contexts.
