This Python code defines a function `words_in_sentence` that takes a sentence as input and returns a new sentence containing only words with lengths that are prime numbers. It achieves this by splitting the input sentence into individual words, iterating through each word, and checking if its length is a prime number. If a word has a prime length, it's added to a list called `prime_words`, and finally, the function joins this list of prime words back into a single sentence. 

The code also includes a separate function `is_prime` which tests if a given number is prime or not. This function is reused in the main logic to check the primality of each word's length. 

The code appears to correctly solve the problem, as evidenced by the illustrative test cases provided in the original prompt and the corresponding output. 

In summary, the code efficiently extracts words from a sentence with prime lengths, demonstrating a clear and concise implementation. The `is_prime` function effectively checks for primality, and the `words_in_sentence` function utilizes it to produce the desired output. 

Note: The `is_prime` function is used within the `words_in_sentence` function, so it's encapsulated and doesn't need to be called externally, it's included here for informational purposes and potential future reuse.  If it wasn't included, it could potentially complicate the understanding of the code.  Also, the `math` module is popularly used for such primality checks, hence its inclusion here.  If primality checks are done frequently in the future, optimizations can be explored based on the context.
