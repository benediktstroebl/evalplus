Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def is_prime(n):
    """
    Checks whether the integer 'n' is a prime number or not.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """
    You are given a string representing a sentence,
    the sentence contains some words separated by a space,
    and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,
    whose lengths are prime numbers,
    the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.
    """
    words = sentence.split(' ')
    new_sentence = ''
    for word in words:
        if is_prime(len(word)):
            new_sentence += word + ' '
    return new_sentence.strip()

# Example Usage
sentence = "This is a test"
print(words_in_sentence(sentence))  # Output: "is"

sentence = "lets go for swimming"
print(words_in_sentence(sentence))  # Output: "go for"
```

This script includes a separate function `is_prime` that checks if a given number is prime or not. The main function `words_in_sentence` splits the sentence into words, then iterates through the words, and when it encounters a word whose length is prime, it adds it to the `new_sentence` variable, which is finally returned. The output of the function will be a sentence with only the words whose lengths are prime numbers.
