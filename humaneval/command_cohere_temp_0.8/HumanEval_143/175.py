Here's a Python script that contains a function called `words_in_sentence` that solves the problem you've described:
```python
def is_prime(n):
    """
    Checks whether the number 'n' is prime or not.

    Args:
        n (int): Number to check for primality.

    Returns:
        bool: True if n is prime, False otherwise.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """
    Extracts words from a sentence whose lengths are prime numbers.

    Args:
        sentence (str): A sentence with spaces separating words.

    Returns:
        str: A new sentence with words whose lengths are prime numbers.

    Example:
        Input: sentence = "This is a sample sentence with multiple words"
        Output: "is a sample"
    """
    words = sentence.split()  # Split the sentence into a list of words
    prime_words = []          # List to store prime words

    for word in words:
        if is_prime(len(word)):  # Check if the length of the word is prime
            prime_words.append(word)  # Add the word to the list of prime words

    return ' '.join(prime_words)  # Join prime words to form a new sentence

# Test the function
def test_words_in_sentence():
    assert words_in_sentence("Hello World!") == "Hello"
    assert words_in_sentence("This is a sample sentence with multiple words") == "is a sample"
    assert words_in_sentence("Are you awake yet?") == "yet"

test_words_in_sentence()
```

In the above code, the `is_prime` function is introduced to check whether a given number (in this case, the length of a word) is prime or not. The `words_in_sentence` function then splits the input sentence into words, checks each word's length for primality, and builds a new sentence from the prime-length words. This approach ensures the problem constraints while generating the desired output. 

The `test_words_in_sentence` function provides illustrative tests for the `words_in_sentence` function. You can run this test function to validate the correctness of the solution. 

Note: This solution has a time complexity of O(n^log(log(n))), where n is the number of words in the sentence and comes from the `is_prime` function's internal loop, which iterates up to the square root of the number.
