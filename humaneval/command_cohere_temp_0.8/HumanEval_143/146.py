```

This code defines a function `is_prime` that checks if a number is prime. It then defines a function `words_in_sentence` that splits a sentence into words, verifies each word's length for primality, and then joins the prime-length words back together. The code demonstrates its correctness with the provided test examples. 
The `is_prime` function is used to check primality for each word length in the `words_in_sentence` function. Words whose lengths are prime are stored in the `prime_words` list after filtering. Finally, these prime-length words are joined together to form the output string, and the order of words in this string maintains the same order as in the input sentence. 
This code efficiently solves the problem and can be directly used to pass any associated tests.
