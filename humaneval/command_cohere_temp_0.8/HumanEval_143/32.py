This script defines a function `is_prime` to check if a given number is prime or not, and a main function `words_in_sentence` that splits the input sentence into words, checks their lengths for primality, and then reconstructs a new sentence from the prime-length words. Both functions are equipped with comments to explain their respective functionalities.

The unit tests included in the script verify that the `is_prime` function behaves as expected, and that the `words_in_sentence` function correctly identifies and extracts words with prime lengths from input sentences. You can add more test cases to cover a variety of scenarios and ensure the correct function behavior.
