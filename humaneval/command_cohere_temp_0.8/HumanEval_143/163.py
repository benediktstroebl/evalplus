Here's a Python script that solves the given problem with an efficient approach using the `collections` module:
```python
import re
from collections import Counter

PRIMES = Counter(filter(lambda x: len(x) > 1 and all(n % i for i in range(2, int(len(x)**0.5) + 1)),
                       set(re.split(r" \s?", input()))))

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    return ' '.join(PRIMES[word] for word in sentence.split() if word in PRIMES)
```

The provided solution leverages the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to efficiently keep track of word counts while filtering out prime-length words. The primality of lengths is assessed using the `filter` function in conjunction with a generator expression. The `set(re.split(...))` step removes any repeated words, ensuring that the word counts maintained by `Counter` are accurate. Lastly, the final output is generated by joining the prime words back together using their original positions in the sentence.
