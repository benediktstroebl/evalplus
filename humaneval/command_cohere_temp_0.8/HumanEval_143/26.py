This code defines a function `words_in_sentence()` that takes in a sentence and returns a new sentence with only words whose lengths are prime numbers.

The code also defines a helper function `is_prime()` which checks if a given number (in this case, the length of a word) is prime or not. This function iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number, if the number is divisible by any of these integers, then it's not a prime. Otherwise, it's deemed prime.

The `words_in_sentence()` function first splits the input sentence into individual words using the `split()` method (preserving the original spacing between words). It then iterates through each word, checking its length using the `is_prime()` function. If the length of a word is prime, it's added to a list called `prime_words`. Finally, the function joins the words in `prime_words` back into a single string with spaces between them and returns the result.

The code has tests tailored to the `is_prime()` and `words_in_sentence()` functions to ensure they perform the correct operations.

Let's break down the test case in the markdown block:
```python
def test_words_in_sentence():
    assert words_in_sentence(" Lets go for swimming ") == "go for"
    assert words_in_sentence("This is a test") == "is"
    assert words_in_sentence("Hello World") == "Hello"
    assert words_in_sentence("Oh no you didn't") == "no"

    # Edge case
    assert words_in_sentence("") == ""
```

The test case has four assertions:
1. The `words_in_sentence()` function is tested on a sentence with extra spaces to ensure it handles them correctly.
2. The function is also tested on a sentence with different words, "This," "is," and "a" to verify it returns only the word with a prime length.
3. The function is tested on a sentence with only one word, and since its length is prime, it's ensured that the result is the same as the input.
4. An edge case is tested to check if the function handles an empty input sentence correctly.

The test case covers various scenarios ensuring that the `words_in_sentence()` function works as expected.
