```

This script includes the `is_prime` function for checking whether a number is prime or not. The `words_in_sentence` function splits the input sentence into words, then iterates through these words, and includes them in the `result` if the length of a word is prime. The `strip` method is used to remove any extra spaces at the end of the `result`.

The code works correctly for the stated examples and also passes the tests for this task. You can verify this by running the following command:
```
python -m pytest -sv ./test_words_in_sentence.py
``` 
This will execute the corresponding tests and show the test results, which should all pass.
