Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def is_prime(n):
    """
    Checks whether the integer 'n' is a prime number or not.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """
    You are given a string representing a sentence,
    the sentence contains some words separated by a space,
    and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,
    whose lengths are prime numbers,
    the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.
    """
    words = sentence.split(' ')
    new_sentence = ''
    for word in words:
        if is_prime(len(word)):
            new_sentence += word + ' '
    return new_sentence.strip()

# Example Usage
sentence = "This is a test"
print(words_in_sentence(sentence))  # Output: "is"

sentence = "lets go for swimming"
print(words_in_sentence(sentence))  # Output: "go for"
```

This script includes the `is_prime` function for checking whether a number is prime, which is utilized in the `words_in_sentence` function to produce a new sentence using only words with prime lengths. The `words_in_sentence` function takes a sentence as input, splits it into words using spaces, and then iterates through the words to check their lengths for primality. If a word has a prime length, it is added to a new sentence string, with spaces between words as they appeared in the original sentence. The output of the function is a string containing only the words with prime lengths, in the order they appeared in the original sentence.  The provided examples showcase how the function works.
