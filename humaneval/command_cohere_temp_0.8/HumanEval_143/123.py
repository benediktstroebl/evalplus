```

This function leverages the `is_prime` helper to check whether a given number is prime. For each word in the sentence, it verifies whether the length of the word is prime. If so, the word is added to the `prime_words` list. Finally, the function rejoins these prime words to form a new sentence. 

The `is_prime` function uses a optimized loop to check for primality. This approach significantly improves efficiency compared to a brute-force primality test, which would be computationally expensive for larger numbers. 

To ensure the function performs as expected, it's advisable to include a robust test suite covering various scenarios, such as edge cases, speed optimizations, and potential error conditions. These tests would effectively validate the correctness of the prime checking method and its integration within the broader function. 

To address potential edge cases, the function includes input validation for sentences with fewer than two words. This adjustment guarantees that the function handles scenarios involving just one word or no words, which could potentially raise errors due to division by zero. 

Additionally, considering performance implications, the code includes an optimized version of the `is_prime` function. This optimization employs a loop that iterates up to the square root of the number. This method significantly reduces computational overhead and enhances the function's overall efficiency. 

Here is an example of how you can use this function:
```python 
print(words_in_sentence("This is a test"))  # Output: 'is'
print(words_in_sentence("lets go for swimming"))  # Output: 'go for'
``` 

This example will return the words from the sentence that have lengths that are prime numbers. 

Note: For the best performance, ensure that your Python interpreter uses a 64-bit architecture. This adjustment enables Python to handle large numbers efficiently and optimize the `is_prime` function's iterations.  Also, while the current code works well for alphanumeric words, it might not handle non-alphanumeric characters like punctuation marks efficiently. Considering practical scenarios, you may enhance the `is_prime` function to effectively handle such diverse character sets.  If you require assistance with the optimization or handle non-alphanumeric characters, let me know, and I'll be glad to offer suggestions or provide a tailored solution to address such scenarios effectively.
