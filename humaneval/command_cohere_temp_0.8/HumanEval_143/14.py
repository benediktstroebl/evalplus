This script defines a `is_prime` function to check whether a given number is prime or not. Additionally, it defines the `words_in_sentence` function that takes a sentence as input, separates it into words, and then filters out the words whose lengths are prime numbers. The filtered prime words are then joined back together to form the final output.

The test cases included confirm that the `is_prime` function works correctly, and the `words_in_sentence` function produces the expected outputs for some sample inputs. You can add more test cases to cover a variety of scenarios and ensure the functions work as expected.  If you encounter any errors while executing this code, please let me know the specifics of the errors, and provide me with any additional information that may be helpful to resolve the issues and refine the code. 

This problem highlights the importance of understanding prime numbers and their use in cryptography and text manipulation. Primality checks are fundamental in encryption algorithms, and this exercise could be a starting point for more advanced cryptographic concepts and algorithms in Python. 

Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any of the topics we've discussed, or provide additional guidance or resources for further exploration.
