    words = sentence.split()  # Split sentence into words using spaces
    prime_words = []          # List to store prime words

    for word in words:
        if is_prime(len(word)):  # Check if the length of the word is prime
            prime_words.append(word)  # Add prime word to the list

    return ' '.join(prime_words)  # Join prime words to form a new sentence
```

This method uses a basic primality test to determine if the length of each word is a prime number, and then adds those words to the `prime_words` list. Finally, it joins the prime words back together into a single string to form the desired output.

The `is_prime` function is introduced to effectively check for primality, ensuring that the code remains efficient and easy to understand. This primality check is used both in the word filtering process and to validate input lengths. The approach guarantees correctness while maintaining a reasonable execution time for sentences of varying lengths.
