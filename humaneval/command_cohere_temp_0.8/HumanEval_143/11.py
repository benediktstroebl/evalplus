This Python script includes a `is_prime` function for testing primality and the `words_in_sentence` function that extracts words from a given sentence, retaining only those with prime lengths and preserving the original sentence's word order.  It utilizes Python's `split` function to split the sentence into individual words and then iterates through them, checking each word's length for primality. When a prime-length word is encountered, it's added to the `result` string with a space delimiter. The final output is a sentence that contains only words with prime lengths, arranged in the same order as the original sentence. 

This solution adheres to the problem statement's constraints and assumes a maximum sentence length of 100 characters, comprising only letters. 
To check the function's correctness, you can call it with different test cases and verify that it outputs the expected results. In this case, the provided examples in the prompt are correctly solved by the given solution.

You can utilize the `is_prime` function independently for various prime-checking requirements in other programming tasks or mathematical applications.
