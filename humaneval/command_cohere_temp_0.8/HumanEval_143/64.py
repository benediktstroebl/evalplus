Here's a Python script that contains a function called `words_in_sentence` that solves the problem you've described:
```python
def is_prime(n):
    """
    Checks whether the number 'n' is prime or not.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """
    You are given a string representing a sentence,
    the sentence contains some words separated by a space,
    and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,
    whose lengths are prime numbers,
    the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.
    """
    words = sentence.split(' ')
    new_sentence = ''
    for word in words:
        if is_prime(len(word)):
            new_sentence += word + ' '
    return new_sentence.strip()

# Example Usage
sentence = "This is a test"
print(words_in_sentence(sentence))  # Output: "is"

sentence = "lets go for swimming"
print(words_in_sentence(sentence))  # Output: "go for"
```

This script will correctly identify and return a new sentence using only words whose lengths are prime numbers.

Note: I added an `is_prime` function to check if a number is prime or not, which is essential to solve this problem.
