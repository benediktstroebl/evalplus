This script includes the `is_prime` function for primality testing, which is essential for solving this problem. The `words_in_sentence` function splits the input sentence into words, filters them based on prime word lengths, and then joins them back together to form the final output. The provided example and its result are also included in the code. Adjust the testing section to match your desired input and expected output if needed.  This code should solve the problem and pass the tests correctly.
