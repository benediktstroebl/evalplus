This Python script includes two functions:
1. The `is_prime` function checks whether a given number is prime or not. It iterates from 2 up to the square root of the number and checks for divisibility. If the number is divisible by any integer within this range, it returns `False`. If not, it confirms the number is prime and returns `True`.
2. The `words_in_sentence` function takes an input sentence as a string, splits it into words using spaces as separators, and then checks the length of each word to see if it's prime. If a word has a prime length, it's added to a list called `prime_words`. Finally, this function joins the prime words back into a string and returns it.

The given examples in the prompt output are correct and demonstrate how the function operates.
