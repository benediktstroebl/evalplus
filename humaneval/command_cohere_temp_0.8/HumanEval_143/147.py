This script includes the `is_prime` function for checking whether a number is prime, which is utilized in the `words_in_sentence` function to produce a new sentence using only words with prime lengths. To make it self-contained, the `is_prime` function is included within the same script, ensuring it's accessible without any external dependencies.
