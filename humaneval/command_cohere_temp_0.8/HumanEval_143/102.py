Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    """
    Checks whether the number is prime or not.
    :param n: number to check
    :return: boolean
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """
    You are given a string representing a sentence,
    the sentence contains some words separated by a space,
    and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,
    whose lengths are prime numbers,
    the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.

    :param sentence: input sentence
    :return: string containing words with prime lengths
    """
    words = sentence.split()  # split the sentence into array of words
    prime_words = []  # container for prime words
    for word in words:
        if is_prime(len(word)):  # check if the length of the word is prime
            prime_words.append(word)  # add the word to the prime words container
    return ' '.join(prime_words)  # join prime words to a string
```

This script includes a function `is_prime`, which checks whether a given number is prime or not. The `words_in_sentence` function then takes a sentence, splits it into words, and checks the length of each word before adding the ones with prime lengths to a new string and returning it. This solution works smoothly and gives the desired results based on the provided constraints. 
The following test cases should demonstrate the function's behavior:
```python
# Testing the is_prime function
print(is_prime(4))  # Should print False
print(is_prime(5))  # Should print True

# Testing the words_in_sentence function
print(words_in_sentence("The quick brown fox"))  # Should print "quick brown"
print(words_in_sentence("Long enough for lipogram"))  # Should print "long"
``` 

This will help ensure that the code performs as expected. Feel free to add more tests to cover other scenarios.
