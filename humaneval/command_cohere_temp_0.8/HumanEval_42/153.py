Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    result = [x + 1 for x in l]
    return result
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the input list and increment it by 1. The incremented values are then returned in a new list. The function is self-contained and can easily be imported and used in other Python scripts.
