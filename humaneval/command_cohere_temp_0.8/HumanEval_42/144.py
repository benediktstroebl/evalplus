Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    result = [x + 1 for x in l]
    return result
```
This function uses a list comprehension to increment each element in the input list by 1 and provide the result as expected in the markdown documentation. 
```python
# Tests
assert incr_list([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 3, 4]
assert incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) == [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
``` 
This ensures the function behaves as expected and aligns with the problem statement's test cases. Let me know if you would like me to explain any part of the code in more detail. Pseudocode: 
Given an input list l, the algorithm follows these steps:
- Initialize an empty list called `result` that will store the incremented elements.
- Use a list comprehension to iterate over each element x in the input list l.
- For each x, add 1 to it using the expression x + 1.
- Append each updated element to the `result` list.
- After processing all elements in l, return the `result` list containing the incremented values. 
This algorithm is efficient with time complexity proportional to the size of the input list l, which is O(n), where n is the number of elements in l. It also has a space complexity of O(n) due to the creation of the `result` list.
