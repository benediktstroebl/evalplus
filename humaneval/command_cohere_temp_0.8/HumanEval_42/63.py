```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    result = [x + 1 for x in l]
    return result
``` 

This Python script defines a function called `incr_list` that takes a list `l` as input. Inside the function, it uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element `x` in the input list `l`, and for each element, it adds 1 to it using the `+ 1` operation. These incremented values are collected in the `result` list. 

The function then returns the `result` list, which contains the updated elements incremented by 1. 

This solution is concise and efficiently accomplishes the task of incrementing the elements in the list, making it an optimal solution for this problem.
