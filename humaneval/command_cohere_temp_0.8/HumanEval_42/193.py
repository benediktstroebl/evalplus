Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    result = [x + 1 for x in l]
    return result
```
This function `incr_list` takes a list as an argument and returns a list where each element is incremented by 1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the input list and adds 1 to it. 

To test this function, you can run the following code which checks if the function behaves as expected:
```python
assert incr_list([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 3, 4]
assert incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) == [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
``` 
This tests the function with both the example use cases provided in the original problem. 
The `assert` statement will throw an error if the tests don't pass.
