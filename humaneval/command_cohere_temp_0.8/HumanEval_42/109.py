Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    result = [x + 1 for x in l]
    return result
```
This script defines a function called `incr_list` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list where each element is incremented by 1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the input list and adds 1 to it, effectively incrementing it. The function outputs are consistent with the given examples in the problem statement. Ensure that you abide by python rules and make sure your code is indented properly to ensure proper functionality.
