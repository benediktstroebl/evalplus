Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    result = [x + 1 for x in l]
    return result
```
This function adheres to the problem's specification, returning a list where each element is incremented by 1. It utilizes a list comprehension to perform this operation efficiently. The function accepts a list as an argument and immediately computes the result using the summary operation. As a result, the provided solution is straightforward, elegant, and effective.

To properly test this function, we can create a test case that verifies its behavior:
```python
def test_incr_list():
    # Regular test case
    assert incr_list([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 3, 4]

    # Edge case: Empty list
    assert incr_list([]) == []

    # Edge case: List with a single element
    assert incr_list([5]) == [6]

    # Comprehensive test case
    assert incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) == [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
```
This test suite covers multiple scenarios, including empty lists, lists with a single element, and a comprehensive test case that validates the correctness of the `incr_list` function for a list with various elements.

When you execute this code, the test suite will be run, and the program will terminate with a status code of 0, indicating that all tests have passed. This confirms that the `incr_list` function operates as anticipated and complies with the problem's specified solution.

This self-contained solution provides a functional Python function and a test suite to ensure its correctness, making it ready for practical usage and maintenance in various projects.
