```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    result = [x + 1 for x in l]
    return result
``` 

This Python script defines a function called `incr_list` that takes a list `l` as input. Inside the function, it uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element `x` in the input list `l`, and for each element, it adds 1 to it using the `+ 1` operation. These incremented values are collected in the `result` list. 

The function then returns the `result` list, which contains the updated elements of the input list incremented by 1. 

This solution is concise and efficiently accomplishes the task of incrementing the elements of a list by 1.
