Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    result = [x + 1 for x in l]
    return result
```
This function `incr_list` takes a list as an argument and returns a list where each element is incremented by 1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the input list and adds 1 to it. The return value is a new list with the incremented elements. 

To test this function, you can call it with various lists and verify that the output list has the expected values. Here is an example:
```python
# Test incr_list()
>>> incr_list([1, 2, 3])
[2, 3, 4]
>>> incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
[6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
```
This demonstrates that the `incr_list` function correctly increments the elements of the input list by 1.
