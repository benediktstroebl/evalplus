Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    result = [x + 1 for x in l]
    return result
```
This function uses a list comprehension to increment each element in the list by 1 and provide the result. Feel free to add more tests to ensure the function meets your requirements and behaves as expected.
