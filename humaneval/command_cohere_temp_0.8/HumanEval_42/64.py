Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    result = [x + 1 for x in l]
    return result
```
This function `incr_list` takes a list as an argument and returns a new list with its elements incremented by 1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the input list and increments it by 1. 

To verify the function, test cases are provided that mirror the sample test cases from the problem statement. These test cases are included in the code snippet below:
```python
# Test the incr_list function
def test_incr_list():
    assert incr_list([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 3, 4]
    assert incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) == [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]

test_incr_list()
```
The function should increment each element in the list by 1, and the test cases confirm that it does so correctly.
