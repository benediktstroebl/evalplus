Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    result = [x + 1 for x in l]
    return result
```
This function uses a list comprehension to increment each element in the input list by 1 and provide the result as expected in the problem statement. Feel free to adapt this solution to your needs! Let me know if you would like me to explain any part of the code further.
