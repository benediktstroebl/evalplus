Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    result = [x + 1 for x in l]
    return result
```
This script defines a function called `incr_list` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list where each element is incremented by 1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the input list and adds 1 to it, effectively incrementing it. The function includes no additional logic or testing infrastructure, as those are specifically excluded by the prompt, to focus solely on the function. 

This solution is concise and straightforward, and it should work correctly for various input lists, incrementing each element appropriately.  If you would like to test this function in the context of a specific scenario, please provide more details, and I will be happy to create a test case that complements this solution.
