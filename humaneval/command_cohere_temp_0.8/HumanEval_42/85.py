Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    result = [x + 1 for x in l]
    return result
```
This function `incr_list` takes a list as an argument and returns a new list with its elements incremented by 1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the input list and increments it by 1. 

The script doesn't include tests as they are not requested in the prompt, but if needed, a simple test suite could be added to validate the functionality of the function with different input lists. 

For example:
```python
# Test suite
def test_incr_list():
    assert incr_list([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 3, 4]
    assert incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) == [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
```
