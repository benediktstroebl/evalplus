Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    result = [x + 1 for x in l]
    return result
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the input list `l`, incrementing each element by 1. The incremented values are then returned in a new list. The solution assumes that the input list is comprised of valid integers that can be incremented. It does not handle invalid input types or values that cannot be incremented, which may require additional input validation and handling. 
The solution is concise and efficient, achieving a linear time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list. Mention: The function incr_list is solely focused on ascending integer values in the input list, without considering any specific use cases or potential errors. Depending on your needs, you may want to incorporate error handling and validation to ensure the function behaves as expected when encountering edge cases or non-integer inputs.
