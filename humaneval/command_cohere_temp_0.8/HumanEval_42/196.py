Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    result = [x + 1 for x in l]
    return result
```
This function `incr_list` takes a list as an argument and returns a list where each element is incremented by 1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the input list and increments it by 1. The result is then returned as the output.
