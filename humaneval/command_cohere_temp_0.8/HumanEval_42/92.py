Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    result = [x + 1 for x in l]
    return result
```
This function `incr_list` takes a list as an argument and returns a new list with elements incremented by 1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the input list and increments it by 1. 

To test this function, you can call it with various lists and verify that the output is correct. Here is an example:
```python
# Test incr_list()
>>> incr_list([1, 2, 3])
[2, 3, 4]
>>> incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
[6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
```
As expected, the function output matches the example provided in the problem statement.
