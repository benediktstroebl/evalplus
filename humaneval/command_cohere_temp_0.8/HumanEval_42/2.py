Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    result = [x + 1 for x in l]
    return result
```
This function takes a list **l** and returns a new list where each element is incremented by 1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the input list and adds 1 to it, thus achieving the desired result of incrementing each element by 1. 

Here's an example usage of the function incr_list to test its functionality:
```python
# Test the incr_list function
assert incr_list([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 3, 4]
assert incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) == [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
```
You can add these test cases to verify the correctness of the function incr_list.
