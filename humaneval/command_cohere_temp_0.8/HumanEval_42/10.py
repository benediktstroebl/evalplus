Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    result = [x + 1 for x in l]
    return result
```
This function takes a list **l** and returns a new list where each element is incremented by 1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the input list and adds 1 to it, effectively incrementing it. 

To follow the problem statement, we return the modified list from the function.
