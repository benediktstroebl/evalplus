Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    result = [x + 1 for x in l]
    return result
```
This function `incr_list` takes a list as an argument and returns a list where each element is incremented by 1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the input list and adds 1 to it. The result is then returned as the output. The function is self-contained and can be run independently. 

Here's an example of how you can use the function to increment a provided list:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = incr_list(my_list)
print(result)
```
This will give the following output:
```
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

You can also test the function with larger lists to see its functionality with intricate input. 
Here's an example of using incr_list with a list of integers:
```python
>>> incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
[6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
```
This result is consistent with the documentation we've been given.
