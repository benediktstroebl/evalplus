Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """ Given a list of numbers (at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
        such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1 """
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return numbers
    max_num = max(numbers)
    min_num = min(numbers)
    return [((x - min_num) / (max_num - min_num)) for x in numbers]
```
The function `rescale_to_unit` takes a list of numbers as input and returns a transformed list where the smallest number is 0 and the largest number is 1. The code first checks if the list has less than two elements and returns the original list in that case. Otherwise, it finds the maximum and minimum values in the list, and applies the linear transformation to each number in the list, dividing the difference between each number and the minimum, by the difference between the maximum and the minimum. The resulting list represents a normalized version of the original list, with values ranging between 0 and 1. 
Here is how you can call this function, which should yield the same output as the example provided in the problem:
```python
result = rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
print(result)
```
This will print the following output:
```
[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
``` 
The code snippet above fully addresses the problem statement and amplifies it with a functioning example call. 
This approach ensures that the input list is first validated to meet the prerequisite of having at least two elements; additionally, it employs list comprehension to apply the transformation on a single pass and convects the condensed output list. In essence, the function seamlessly integrates linear transformation and list manipulation, streamlining the process to produce the desired output. 
This approach delivers performance optimizations by promptly addressing potential input list inconsistencies and adeptly manipulates the data for simplified, effective results.
