Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    return [num / max(numbers) for num in numbers]
```
This script defines a function `rescale_to_unit` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of numbers scaled to the range [0, 1]. The function simply divides each number in the list by the maximum number in the list using the `max` function. This normalization technique serves as a widely used linear transform that facilitates analysis and plotting in various applications.
