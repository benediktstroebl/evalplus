Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    rescaled = [(x - min(numbers)) / (max(numbers) - min(numbers)) * 1.0 for x in numbers]
    return rescaled
```

The function `rescale_to_unit` takes a list of numbers `List[float]` as input and returns a corresponding list rescaled to the range between 0 and 1. The function works by first finding the minimum and maximum values in the input list using the `min` and `max` functions, respectively. It then calculates the rescaled value of each number in the input list by subtracting the minimum value, dividing by the difference between the maximum and minimum values, and multiplying by 1.0 to ensure proper scaling to the unit interval. The resulting scaled values are stored in the `rescaled` list, which is returned as the function output.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```python
test_list = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
print(rescale_to_unit(test_list))
```

Output:
```
[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```

This indicates that the original list has been transformed such that its minimum value (1.0) has been scaled to 0, and its maximum value (5.0) has been scaled to 1.

This function is readily testable in Python, as demonstrated in the code block above. The test code provided verifies that the function rescales a list correctly, where the smallest number becomes 0, and the largest becomes 1. Consequently, the output of this test aligns with the expected output.  This function and the test case can be extended to handle various edge cases and different types of input to ensure robustness against various scenarios that may arise in practical applications.  It can be further optimized for speed or adaptability if specific constraints or requirements demand it.
