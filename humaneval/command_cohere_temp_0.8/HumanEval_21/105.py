Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    return [(x-min(numbers))/(max(numbers)-min(numbers))*1 for x in numbers]
```
The function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of numbers scaled to the range [0, 1] based on the smallest and largest values in the input list. The markdown code example provided essentially defines the same function.

To demonstrate the functionality of the function, here is an example of usage:
```python
# Test the function
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
print(rescale_to_unit(numbers))  # Output: [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```

This will produce the expected output, confirming that the function applies the linear transform as described in the problem statement.
