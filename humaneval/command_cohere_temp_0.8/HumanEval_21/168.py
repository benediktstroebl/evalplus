```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    # Find the minimum and maximum values in the list
    min_value = min(numbers)
    max_value = max(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the rescaled values
    rescaled = [(val - min_value) / (max_value - min_value) for val in numbers]
    
    return rescaled
```

The function `rescale_to_unit` takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of rescaled values. It first identifies the minimum and maximum values within the input list using the `min` and `max` functions. Then, it applies a linear transformation to each value in the list, subtracting the calculated minimum and dividing by the difference between the maximum and minimum to normalize the values between 0 and 1. 

This normalization is useful in various data analysis and visualization tasks, especially when you want to align data on a common scale, allowing for easier comparison and interpretation. 

You can continue to iterate and improve the function with more tests and edge cases to ensure it behaves as expected across the spectrum of possible inputs.
