```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    return [(x-min(numbers))/(max(numbers)-min(numbers))*1 for x in numbers]
```

The function `rescale_to_unit` takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of numbers rescaled to the range between 0 and 1 (inclusive). The transformation is a linear transformation that is applied to all numbers in the list. The smallest number in the list will be transformed to 0 and the largest number to 1 after this operation, and all other numbers will be linearly scaled between these two limits.

The function makes use of Python's list comprehension and arithmetic operations. List comprehension is used to apply the scaling factor to each number in the list, and arithmetic operations (`min`, `max`) are used to compute the boundaries of the scaling factor.

Here's an example of how you can use the function and verify its behavior:
```python
import unittest

class TestRescaleToUnit(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_rescale_to_unit(self):
        self.assertEqual(rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]), [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0])

    def test_rescale_to_unit_with_single_number(self):
        self.assertEqual(rescale_to_unit([10.0]), [1.0])

    def test_rescale_to_unit_with_empty_list(self):
        self.assertEqual(rescale_to_unit([]), [])

    def test_rescale_to_unit_with_list_with_one_number(self):
        self.assertEqual(rescale_to_unit([6.0]), [0.5])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In the above test suite, we have several test cases that cover different scenarios, such as the edge case of an empty list, a list with a single number, as well as a list with a minimum of two numbers. The `unittest.main()` function is used to discover and run the tests. 

Note: the function signature `rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]` indicates that the function takes a list of float numbers as an argument and returns a list of float numbers, the `->` symbol is used for that.
