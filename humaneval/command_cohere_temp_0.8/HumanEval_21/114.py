```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    return [(x-min(numbers))/(max(numbers)-min(numbers))*1 for x in numbers]
```

The function `rescale_to_unit` takes a list of numbers as input and returns a transformed list such that the smallest number in the input list becomes 0, and the largest number becomes 1. The transformation is a linear transformation and is achieved by subtracting the minimum of the list and dividing by the difference between the maximum and minimum of the list, and then multiplying by 1.
