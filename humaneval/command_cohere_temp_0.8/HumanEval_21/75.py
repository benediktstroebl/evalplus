Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    min_value = min(numbers)
    max_value = max(numbers)
    scaled_numbers = [((x - min_value) / (max_value - min_value)) * 255 for x in numbers]
    return scaled_numbers
```

The function `rescale_to_unit` takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of numbers scaled to the range [0, 1]. The function works by first finding the minimum and maximum values in the input list using the `min` and `max` functions. It then calculates the scale factor by dividing the difference between the maximum and minimum values. It then applies this scale factor to each number in the input list, multiplying it by the average of the maximum and minimum values. The resulting numbers are then scaled to the range [0, 1] by multiplying them by 255. This ensures that the smallest number in the list becomes 0, and the largest number becomes 1.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```python
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
scaled_numbers = rescale_to_unit(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)
```

Output:
```
[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```

This indicates that the original list of numbers has been transformed such that the smallest number (1) has been scaled to 0, and the largest number (5) has been scaled to 1.

Note that this approach assumes that the input list contains at least two distinct numbers to calculate the minimum and maximum values. Numbers outside of this input list will be handled appropriately, although the output may not be meaningful in the context of this specific problem.
