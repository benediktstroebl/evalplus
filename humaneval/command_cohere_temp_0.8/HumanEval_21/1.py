```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """
    Given a list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1.
    """
    return [(x-min(numbers))/(max(numbers)-min(numbers)) for x in numbers]
```

The function `rescale_to_unit` takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of numbers scaled to the range [0, 1] via linear transformation. This approach is also applicable to other types like `Complex` and `Decimal`.

To ensure the function works as expected, two tests are provided:
1. A simple test that checks the pass through of the example given in the problem description.
2. A more complex test that checks the function on a list where the maximum and minimum numbers are not the last and first elements of the list.

Here is an example of how to use this code:
```python
import unittest
from rescale_to_unit import rescale_to_unit

class TestRescaleToUnit(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_rescale_to_unit(self):
        numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
        expected = [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
        self.assertEqual(rescale_to_unit(numbers), expected)

    def test_rescale_to_unit_more_complex(self):
        numbers = [4.0, 2.0, 3.0, 6.0, 2.0, 1.0]
        expected = [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.5, 0.0]
        self.assertEqual(rescale_to_unit(numbers), expected)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Note that using `unittest.main()` to run tests will not work with this code, as the tests are defined in a separate class TestRescaleToUnit. To execute these tests, you can either run them manually through the IDE or by using a testing framework like `pytest`.
