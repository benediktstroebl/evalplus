Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    return [num / max(numbers) for num in numbers]
```
This script defines a function `rescale_to_unit` that takes in a list of numbers and rescales them linearly such that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest number becomes 1. This can be seen in the use case:
```python
>>> rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```
The script returns a list of numbers scaled to the range [0, 1].
