```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    return [(x-min(numbers))/(max(numbers)-min(numbers)) * 1 for x in numbers]
```

The function `rescale_to_unit` takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of numbers rescaled to the range between 0 and 1 (inclusive). The transformation is a linear transformation that is applied to each element in the list.

The function first finds the minimum and maximum values of the input list using the `min` and `max` functions, respectively. Then, for each element `x` in the input list, it calculates `x - min(numbers)` to center the values around 0. Then, it divides by the difference between `max(numbers)` and `min(numbers)` to scale the values to the range 1, resulting in the output list. 

Here is an example of using the `rescale_to_unit` function above with the expected output in the markdown cell:
```python
rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
```
```
[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```

This approach is testable and reusable for solving similar problems.
