Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    return [(x-min(numbers))/(max(numbers)-min(numbers))*1 for x in numbers]
```
The function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a scaled list according to the problem statement, such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1. This is done using the scaling equation $(x' = (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))$ where $(x)$ is the input list and $(x')$ is the transformed output list. 

The function also passes the provided test case, as shown by the comment at the end of the code block. 
```python
# Test the function
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
expected_output = [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
print(rescale_to_unit(numbers) == expected_output)  # True
``` 
This will output:
```
True
```
