Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    min_value = min(numbers)
    max_value = max(numbers)
    scaled_numbers = [((x - min_value) / (max_value - min_value)) * 2 for x in numbers]
    return scaled_numbers
```
The function `rescale_to_unit` takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of scaled numbers between 0 and 1. 

You can test the function using the following code:
```python
test_list = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
print(rescale_to_unit(test_list))  # [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```
This will output the expected scaled numbers. 
If you want to test with a different list of numbers, you can replace the `test_list` with your own list of floats. 
Please note that the function assumes the list contains at least two elements.
