Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """ Given a list of numbers (at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
        such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1 """
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return numbers  # panic handle, list is too small to be meaningful
    min_value = min(numbers)
    max_value = max(numbers)
    return [((x - min_value) / (max_value - min_value)) for x in numbers]
```
The function handles the edge case where the passed list has less than two elements, preserving it unchanged. 
The main logic applies a linear transformation to the elements, using the list's minimum and maximum values as endpoints of the transform's range.

This solution should correctly solve the problem as stated in the given markdown code block. You can use it as a starting point to verify and analyze the functionality of the provided solution. 

Here is a simple test suite that can be used to verify the functionality:
```python
def test_rescale_to_unit():
    assert rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]) == [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
    assert rescale_to_unit([5.0, 7.0, 3.2, 4.0, 6.1]) == [0.2, 0.6, 0.04, 0.3, 0.1]

def test_edge_cases():
    assert rescale_to_unit([1.0])  # edge case, list with one element is unchanged
    assert rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0])  # also valid, but checks the same case
    assert rescale_to_unit([-1.0, 1.0]) == [-1.0, 0.0]  # handle case with negative min
    assert rescale_to_unit([0.0, 1.0])   == [0.0, 1.0]   # handle case where min == max
```
You can copy and paste this code into a Python interpreter or script to test the function. 
The test suite includes tests for edge cases and tests for the basic functionality. Gor bulk testing, you might want to explore using framework like `pytest` for more efficient and organized testing. 

If you are interested in optimizing the function, keeping it Pythonic, or discussing other related topics, let's dive deeper into these aspects! 
Feel free to ask questions or request further refinement of the code according to your specific needs.
