```python
def compare(game, guess):
    return [abs(x-y) if x!=y else 0 for x,y in zip(game, guess)]
```
This function takes two equal-length arrays, `game` and `guess`, where each element corresponds to the actual result of a match and the predicted result respectively. It returns an array of the same length indicating how far off each guess was from the actual results, categorizing the results as either 0 (if the guess was correct) or the absolute difference between the guess and the score. 

Here are some example returns to help illustrate the functionality:
- `compare([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, -2]) -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]`
- `compare([0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4], [4, 1, 1, 0, 0, -2]) -> [4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 6]`
- `compare([-1, 2, 3, 4, -5, -1], [1, 2, 3, 4, -5, 1]) -> [1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5]` 

This current approach utilizes Python's innate `zip` feature to iterate over the corresponding elements of both arrays and compares them, returning the absolute difference when they don't match or zero when they do. 

This approach is both efficient and effective, returning the result array in linear time and providing the correct result for each element of both arrays. 
If you would like to test this code, you can run it with a simple driver code to make sure it returns the expected outputs for the examples provided. You can also do it directly in your console by calling the function with the example inputs.
