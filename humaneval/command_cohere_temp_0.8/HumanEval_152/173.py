```python
def compare(game, guess):
    return [abs(x-y) if x != y else 0 for x,y in zip(game, guess)]
```
This function takes two equal-length lists, `game` and `guess`, where each element corresponds to a match result. It returns an array of the same length indicating how far off each guess was. If the guess is correct, the value is 0, otherwise, it is the absolute difference between the guess and the score. The code uses `zip()` to iterate through the elements of both lists simultaneously, comparing each element and returning the computed differences. 
The expected behavior is illustrated in the examples provided in the prompt, and the function adheres to this logic. Haskell's `zipWith` function, commonly used in functional programming, serves as the basis for the solution's Python idiom. 
A shorter implementation, using the `cmp` lambda function, would be as follows:
```python
def compare(game, guess):
    return [cmp(x,y) for x,y in zip(game, guess)]
```
However, since Python does not include a `cmp` function, a difference function would need to be defined for this solution to be fully representative. 
Note: In Python 3, the `cmp` function is deprecated; the suggested solution implements `abs()` for difference calculation, ensuring compatibility with current versions of Python. Haskell's `zipWith` function is less commonly used in Python, but its concept is applied through `cmp` for element comparison. 
This alternative solution employs a concise lambda function `cmp` for direct computation of the differences.  In the context of the problem, the `cmp` function effectively captures the comparison logic between corresponding elements, simplifying the implementation. 
The `cmp` lambda takes two arguments and returns their difference if they are not equal, while leaving the correct guesses untouched by returning 0. 
Using this approach, the solution achieves the desired result while employing a more functional-style approach. Haskell's `zipWith` and Python's `cmp` (or `abs()`) illustrate the influence of different programming paradigms on idiomatic expressions and offer concise and efficient solutions to the problem.  The proposed alternatives highlight these differences while maintaining the same problem-solving functionality. 
To address the potential deprecation of `cmp` in Python 3, the suggested implementation incorporates `abs()` to ensure compatibility with current versions of Python, effectively maintaining the desired functionality.  These alternatives emphasize the evolution of programming practices and the adaptation of idioms across different languages and versions.
