```python
def compare(game, guess):
    return [abs(x-y) if x!=y else 0 for x,y in zip(game, guess)]
```
This Python script defines a function called `compare` which takes two arrays, `game` and `guess`, as input. It returns a list where each element corresponds to the result of comparing the corresponding elements in the `game` and `guess` arrays. 

The function uses a list comprehension with a conditional check on each pair of elements (`x` and `y`) from the `game` and `guess` arrays. The conditional check first checks if `x` is equal to `y`. If the condition is true, it returns 0, indicating that the guess matched the result correctly. If the condition is false, it calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y`, resulting in the difference between the guess and the actual result. 

This difference, whether calculated through subtraction or by assigning 0, is then returned in the list comprehension, resulting in a list that details how far off each guess was in the input arrays. 

The code snippet passed the provided tests, ensuring that it effectively compares the input arrays and returns the results accordingly.
