```python
def compare(game, guess):
    return [abs(x-y) if x!=y else 0 for x,y in zip(game, guess)]
```
This function takes two equal-length lists, `game` and `guess`, where each element corresponds to the score of a match, and returns an array of the same length containing zero if the guess was correct, and the absolute difference between the guess and the score otherwise. Test cases are also provided within the code block to demonstrate the correct functioning of the function. 
The tests can be run by adding the following code before the final `return` statement:
```python
# Here we test our function with a variety of examples
test_cases = [
    ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, -2]),
    ([0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4], [4, 1, 1, 0, 0, -2]),
    ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], [2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]),
]

for game, guess in test_cases:
    assert compare(game, guess) == [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3], "Comparing {} and {} yields an unexpected result".format(game, guess)
```
