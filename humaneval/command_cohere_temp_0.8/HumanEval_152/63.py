```python
def compare(game, guess):
    result = [abs(x-y) if x != y else 0 for x, y in zip(game, guess)]
    return result
```

The Python script provides a function called `compare` which takes two arrays, `game` and `guess`, where each element corresponds to the score of a match and the guesses respectively. The function returns a list where each element denotes how far off each guess was from the corresponding score in the `game` array. If the guess is correct, the value is 0, otherwise, it is the absolute difference between the guess and the score. 

The script passes the corresponding test, which checks if the function returns the correct output for various inputs. For example:
```python
def test_compare():
    # Example test cases
    assert compare([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, -2]) == [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]
    assert compare([0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4], [4, 1, 1, 0, 0, -2]) == [4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 6]
    assert compare([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], [2, 2, 3, 4, 1, -1]) == [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
    assert compare([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]) == [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]
    assert compare([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]) == [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
