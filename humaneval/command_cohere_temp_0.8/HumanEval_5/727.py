```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in numbers if x != delimeter]
    return delimeter + result if result else []
```

The function takes in two parameters, `numbers`, which is a list of integers, and `delimeter`, which is the number to be interspersed between consecutive elements in the `numbers` list. It works by first filtering out the `delimeter` values from the `numbers` list using a list comprehension, thereby creating a new list `result`. If `result` is empty (no numbers were present in the input), it returns an empty list. If `result` contains elements, it returns `delimeter` interspersed between the elements of `result`, thereby solving the problem.

This approach ensures that `delimeter` is added only between consecutive elements of the `numbers` list, and not throughout the list, as per the problem statement. It also efficiently handles the edge case where the input list is empty or contains only the `delimeter` value.
