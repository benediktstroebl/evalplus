```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimiter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in numbers if x != delimiter]
    result.extend([delimiter] * (len(numbers) - len(result)))
    return result
``` 

The function takes a list of numbers `numbers` and an interspersing delimiter `delimiter` as inputs. First, it filters out the delimiter from the list using a list comprehension, then appends the delimiter to the list, ensuring the length of the result matches the original length of the input list. This approach ensures that each element in the list is separated by the designated delimiter after the intersperse operation. 

This function solves the problem of inserting a specific number as a delimiter between each element in a given list and can be called with different lists and delimiter values as needed.
