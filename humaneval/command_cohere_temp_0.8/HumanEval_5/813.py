```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in numbers if x != delimeter]
    return delimeter + result if result else []
```

The function takes in two parameters, `numbers`, which is a list of integers, and `delimeter`, an integer to insert between consecutive numbers. To solve the problem, the code uses list comprehension to filter out the `delimeter` from the `numbers` list and returns the delimeter combined with the filtered list of numbers. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), where n is the length of the input list `numbers`. It is also important to note that this solution assumes that the `delimeter` value is not present in the `numbers` list, which may need to be checked for edge cases.
