```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in numbers if x != delimeter]
    return delimeter + result if result else []
```

The function takes in two parameters, `numbers`, which is a list of integers, and `delimeter`, which is the number to be inserted between consecutive elements of the `numbers` list. It uses list comprehension to iterate through the numbers, excluding the `delimeter` from the final `result` list.

The logic is encapsulated in this self-contained script, which completes the intersperse function's goal of inserting the provided delimiter between each pair of elements in the input list.
