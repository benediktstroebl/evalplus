```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimiter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in numbers if x != delimiter]
    result.extend([delimiter] * (len(numbers) - len(result)))
    return result
``` 

The function takes in a list of numbers `numbers` and an interspersing delimiter `delimiter` as parameters. It initially constructs a new list `result` by iterating through `numbers` and omitting all instances of `delimiter`. To ensure that the resulting list contains the correct number of delimiters, it then appends `delimiter` to `result` the appropriate number of times (calculated as `len(numbers) - len(result)`). The function returns the augmented `result` list. 

This approach ensures that each neighboring pair of elements in `numbers` is separated by `delimiter` and that the resulting list maintains the appropriate structure.
