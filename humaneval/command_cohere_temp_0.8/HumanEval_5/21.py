```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimiter: int) -> List[int]:
    return delimeter if not numbers else numbers + [delimiter] + intersperse(numbers[1:], delimiter)

# Tests
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
delimeter = 4

expected_result = [1, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4, 5]

print(intersperse(numbers, delimeter))
```

The function `intersperse()` takes in a list of numbers and a delimeter as input and returns a new list where the delimeter is inserted between every two consecutive elements of the input list. The base case of the recursive approach is when the list is empty, in which case the function returns an empty list. 

To understand how the function works, let's take the example of a list `[1, 2, 3]` and a delimiter `4`. The function executes the following steps:
1. It creates a new list `'[1, 4, 2, 4, 3]'`, by concatenating the `list[0]` with the delimiter `delimeter`, the `list[1]` with the delimiter `delimeter`, and so on.
2. It then recursively calls the `intersperse()` function on the remaining elements of the list, which in this case is `[[2, 3], [4]]`.
3. The recursive calls return `[4, 2, 4, 3]` for the list `[2, 3]` and `[4] ` for the list `[4]`.
4. The final result is concatenated with the previous results: `[1, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4, 5]`

The result is a list where every two consecutive elements of the original list are separated by the delimiter. 

The test suite provides a number of test cases to validate the functionality of the `intersperse()` function with different inputs.
