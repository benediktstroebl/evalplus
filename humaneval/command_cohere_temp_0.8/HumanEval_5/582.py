```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimiter: int) -> List[int]:
    return delimeter if not numbers else numbers + [delimeter] + intersperse(numbers[1:], delimiter)

# Tests
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
delimeter = 4

expected_result = [1, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4, 5]

assert intersperse(numbers, delimeter) == expected_result
``` 

The function `intersperse()` takes in a list of integers `numbers` and an int `delimeter` as parameters. If the input list is empty, it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it places the `delimeter` between every two consecutive elements in the input list, and additionally places it at the end of the list (except for the last element). The resulting list is then returned. 

The test case checks the function against an example list of numbers and a delimeter, comparing the result to the expected output. 
To further verify the correctness of the function, please jog through some example inputs and expected outputs on paper to ensure the function behaves as expected. Let me know if any further assistance is required!  If this looks good, feel free to extend more test cases to bulletproof the solution.
