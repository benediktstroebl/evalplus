```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in numbers if x != delimeter]
    return delimeter + result if result else []
```

The function takes in two parameters, `numbers`, which is a list of integers, and `delimeter`, which is the number to be interspersed between consecutive elements in the `numbers` list. It works by first creating a list `result` that filters out the `delimeter` values from the `numbers` list. Then, if `result` is not empty, it appends a `delimeter` to the end of `result` to ensure that the final list ends with the desired interspersed value. The logic effectively creates a new list with the desired interspersed value added in between consecutive elements, ensuring there is no duplication of the `delimeter` in the final result. 

This approach guarantees the correct interspersing behavior, handles empty lists, and ensures the `delimeter` is included only once in the result for consecutive elements.
