```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in numbers if x != delimeter]
    return delimeter + result if result else []
```

The function takes in two parameters, `numbers`, which is a list of integers, and `delimeter`, which is the number to be placed in between consecutive numbers. It works by first filtering out the `delimeter` values from the `numbers` list using a list comprehension, thereby creating a new list `result`. If the `result` list is empty, indicating that the input list contained only delimeters, it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it returns the `delimeter` value appended to the `result` list, thereby achieving the desired effect of inserting the `delimeter` between every two consecutive elements. 

Here is a simple test case to verify the functionality of the code:
```python
test_cases = [
    ([], 4, []),
    ([1, 2, 3], 4, [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]),
    ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3, [1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 5]),
]

for numbers, delimeter, expected in test_cases:
    actual = intersperse(numbers, delimeter)
    assert actual == expected
```
