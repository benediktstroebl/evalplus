```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimiter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in numbers if x != delimiter]
    result.extend([delimiter] * (len(numbers) - len(result)))
    return result
```

The function takes in two parameters, `numbers`, which is a list of integers, and `delimiter`, which is the number to be interspersed between the elements of the list. The function checks for the delimiter and includes it in the resultant list only once, instead of including it between every two elements.
