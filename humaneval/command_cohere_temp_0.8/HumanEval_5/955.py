```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimiter: int) -> List[int]:
    return delimeter if not numbers else numbers + [delimiter] + intersperse(numbers[1:], delimiter)

# Tests
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
delimeter = 4

expected_result = [1, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4, 5]

assert intersperse(numbers, delimeter) == expected_result
``` 

The function `intersperse()` takes in a list of numbers and a delimiter as arguments. If the input list is empty, it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it places the delimiter between every two consecutive elements in the input list, and subsequently calls itself recursively with the rest of the list to propagate the delimeter insertion step. The output is a list where each element of the original list has a delimeter inserted after it. 

The test script provided checks the functionality of the `interspere()` function by using a specific list of numbers and a delimiter, then comparing the expected result with the output of the function.  It verifies that the delimeter is appropriately placed between each element of the list, even when the list is not initially assigned to a variable.  This type of recursion is known as "tail-recursion", where the recursive call is the last operation in the function, making it amenable to iterative optimization techniques like "tail-call optimization".  In Python, tail call optimization is not natively supported, but behaves well with a recursive limit of 1000 in Python 3.7 and above.  This limit of recursion can be raised for larger use cases if necessary.  Here's a brief code snippet that raises the limit to 5000, which is often sufficient for many practical applications:
```python
import sys

# Set the maximum allowed recursive calls
sys.setrecursionlimit(5000)
``` 
If your list of numbers is extremely long and you exceed this limit, you might need to reconsider your approach to solve this problem, perhaps using a non-recursive solution, or investigating streaming or iterative strategies which are more efficient in terms of stack space. Gor more information on tail call optimization and limitations, you can read about it in Python's official documentation.
