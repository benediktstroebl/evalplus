```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in numbers if x != delimeter]
    return delimeter + result if result else []
```

The function takes in two parameters, `numbers`, which is a list of integers, and `delimeter`, which is the number to be interspersed between consecutive elements in the `numbers` list. It uses list comprehension to filter out the `delimeter` tokens from the `numbers` list and then constructs the resulting list by adding `delimeter` to the end of the filtered list. The logic negates the filtered list if it is empty to ensure an empty list is returned in such a case.
