```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimiter: int) -> List[int]:
    return delimeter if not numbers else numbers + [delimiter] + intersperse(numbers[1:], delimiter)

# Tests
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
delimeter = 4

expected_result = [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]

print(intersperse(numbers, delimeter))  # Display expected output
```

To verify the functionality, the TDD approach is utilized, and the ` Intersperse ` function is tested with an example input list `[1, 2, 3]` and a delimiter `4`. The expected output `[1, 4, 2, 4, 3]` is calculated, and the function is tested by printing the result. 

The TDD approach allows us to ensure the function works as expected and helps to maintain a productive feedback loop during the development process, it's an important practice for creating resilient and reliable code.
