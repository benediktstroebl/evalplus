```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimiter: int) -> List[int]:
    return delimeter if not numbers else numbers + [delimiter] + intersperse(numbers[1:], delimiter)

# Tests
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(intersperse(numbers, 3))
```

The function takes in a list of numbers and an integer delimeter as input and returns a list where each number is delimited by the delimeter. 

The base case returns just the delimeter if the input list is empty, and iterates through the list if it is not, adding the delimeter to the end of the list and recursively calling the function on the rest of the numbers until there are no more, at which point we return the finished list. 

The example should output the following:
```
[1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 5]
``` 

Let me know if you would like me to explain any part of the code in more detail.
