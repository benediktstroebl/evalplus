```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimiter: int) -> List[int]:
    result: List[int] = []
    for num in numbers:
        result.append(num)
        if len(result) < len(numbers):
            result.append(delimiter)
    return result
```

The `intersperse()` function takes in a list of integers `numbers` and an int `delimiter` as parameters. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the `numbers` list, adding each one to the `result` list. To simulate the delimiter, it adds the `delimiter` to the `result` list after each number, except for the last number, where it doesn't have a subsequent element to add a delimiter to. This ensures that the `result` list contains the same elements as `numbers`, with a delimiter between each pair of consecutive elements. The function returns the `result` list.  It solves the problem statement by inserting the delimiter between every two consecutive elements of the input list `numbers`.
