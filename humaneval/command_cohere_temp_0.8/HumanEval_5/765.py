```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in numbers if x != delimeter]
    return delimeter + result if result else []
```

The function takes in two parameters, `numbers`, which is a list of integers, and `delimeter`, which is the number to be placed between consecutive elements of the `numbers` list. The function checks if the `numbers` list contains the `delimeter` value. If the `delimeter` is present, it removes it from the list and returns the `delimeter` value plus the remaining elements of the list. If the `numbers` list does not contain the `delimeter`, it returns the list as is. 
A usage example is: 
```python
>>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)
[1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
```
In the example above, the `delimeter` value is 4, and it is placed between each consecutive pair of numbers.
