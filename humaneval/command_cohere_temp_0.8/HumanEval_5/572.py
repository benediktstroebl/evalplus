```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in numbers if x != delimeter]
    return delimeter + result if result else []
```

The function takes in two parameters, `numbers`, which is a list of integers, and `delimeter`, an integer to insert between consecutive numbers. To solve the problem, the function performs the following steps:
- Creates a list `result` by filtering `numbers` to exclude the `delimeter` values. This list contains all the integers from `numbers` except for `delimeter`, which will be inserted separately.
- Lastly, the `delimeter` value is concatenated to `result`, placing it between each element in `result` in the appropriate order. The result is then returned. 

**Examples:**
```python
>>> intersperse([], 4)
[]
>>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)
[1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
>>> intersperse([1, 3, 5, 7, 9], 2)
[1, 2, 3, 5, 2, 7, 2, 9]
```
