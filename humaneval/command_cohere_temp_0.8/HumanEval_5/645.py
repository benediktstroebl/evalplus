```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in numbers if x != delimeter]
    return delimeter + result if result else []
```

The function takes in two parameters, `numbers`, which is a list of integers, and `delimeter`, which is the number to be interspersed between consecutive elements in the `numbers` list. It works by first filtering out the `delimeter` from the `numbers` list using a list comprehension, thereby generating a new list `result`. If this `result` list is empty (meaning the original list had only the `delimeter` or was empty to begin with), it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it returns the `result` list concatenated with the `delimeter`, achieving the required interspersed format. 

This approach ensures that the `delimeter` is not included in the final interspersed list and handles the edge case of an empty input list gracefully, without causing a `TypeError` for empty list slicing.
