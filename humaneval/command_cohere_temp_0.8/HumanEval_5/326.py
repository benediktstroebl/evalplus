```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimiter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in numbers if x != delimiter]
    result.extend([delimiter] * (len(numbers) - len(result)))
    return result
``` 

The function takes a list of numbers `numbers` and an interspersing delimiter `delimiter` as inputs. First, it filters out the delimiter from the list using a list comprehension, then, it extends the resultant list with the delimiter, using the length of the original list as a reference, to ensure that the resultant list has the same length as the original list.
