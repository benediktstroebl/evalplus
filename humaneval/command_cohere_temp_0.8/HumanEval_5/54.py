```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimiter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in numbers if x != delimiter]
    result.extend([delimiter] * (len(numbers) - len(result)))
    return result
``` 

The function takes in a list of numbers `numbers` and an interspersing delimiter `delimiter` as arguments. It initializes an empty list `result` to store the interspersed numbers. It then uses a list comprehension to filter out the delimiter from the `numbers` list, creating a new list with all the numbers except for the delimiter. 

Next, it determines the number of times the delimiter needs to be added to the `result` list. This is done by calculating the length of the `result` list and subtracting it from the length of the original `numbers` list, which gives the number of delimiters that need to be added. The `extend` method is then used to add the required number of delimiters to the `result` list.

Finally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains the desired interspersed combination of numbers and delimiters. 

This approach ensures that the delimiter is added at appropriate intervals between the numbers, and the resulting list is returned as the output of the function.
