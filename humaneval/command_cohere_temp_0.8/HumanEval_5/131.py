```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in numbers if x != delimeter]
    return delimeter + result if result else []
```

The function takes in two parameters, `numbers`, which is a list of integers, and `delimeter`, which is the number to be interspersed between consecutive elements in the `numbers` list. It works by first creating a list `result` that filters out the `delimeter` values from the `numbers` list. Then, if `result` is not empty, it appends a `delimeter` to the end of `result` to ensure that the final list ends with the desired interspersed value. The logic effectively creates a new list with the desired interspersed value added in between consecutive elements, handling the edge case where the input list is empty or contains only the `delimeter` value.
