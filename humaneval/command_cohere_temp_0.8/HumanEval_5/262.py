```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in numbers if x != delimeter]
    return delimeter + result if result else []
```

The function takes in two parameters, `numbers`, which is a list of integers, and `delimeter`, which is the number to be inserted between consecutive elements of the `numbers` list. The function checks for the edge case where the `numbers` list is empty, and returns an empty list in such cases. In all other cases, the function returns a new list where the `delimeter` value is appended to the end of the list after every element, except for the `delimeter` itself, which is excluded from the final list. 

The function returns a list of integers with the same elements as the input list `numbers`, but with the `delimeter` inserted between each consecutive pair of elements. 

For example, if `numbers = [1, 2, 3]` and `delimeter = 4`, the function will return `[1, 4, 2, 4, 3]`. 

This approach utilizes list comprehension and the built-in `if x != delimeter` conditional checking mechanism for efficiency and effectivity in producing the desired result.
