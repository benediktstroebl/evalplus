```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in numbers if x != delimeter]
    return delimeter + result if result else []
```

The function takes in two parameters, `numbers`, which is a list of integers, and `delimeter`, which is the number to be placed in between each consecutive number. The function checks if the `numbers` list contains the `delimeter` value. If the `delimeter` is not present, it returns the `numbers` list as it is. If the `delimeter` is present, it inserts the `delimeter` value after each number in the `numbers` list, except for the `delimeter` itself, and returns the new list.

Here is an example of use:
```python
>>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)
[1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
>>> intersperse([0, 5, 2, 4], 3)
[0, 3, 5, 3, 2, 3, 4]
>>> intersperse([7, 6, 9], 10)
[7, 10, 6, 10, 9]
>>> intersperse([], 4)
[]
```
