```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in numbers if x != delimeter]
    return delimeter + result if result else []
```

The function takes in two parameters, `numbers`, which is a list of integers, and `delimeter`, which is the number to be inserted between consecutive elements of the `numbers` list. The function checks if the `numbers` list has any elements apart from the `delimeter` and removes instances of the `delimeter` from the final result. An empty list is returned if the input list is empty or consists of only delimeters. The resulting list is concatenated with the `delimeter` and returned if there are some non-delimeter elements in the `numbers` list. 

Here is an example usage of the function and its corresponding output:
```python
>>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)
[1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
```

This will return `[1, 4, 2, 4, 3]` as the interstitial ordering of the list is shifted so that 4 is nestled between each number. We can see this more visibly in the following example:
```python
>>> intersperse([1, 2, 3, 4], 5)
[1, 5, 2, 5, 3, 5, 4]
```
Here, the list `[1, 2, 3, 4]` is modified to `[1, 5, 2, 5, 3, 5, 4]` such that the element 5 is inserted between each consecutive pair of elements in the list. 

The function is designed to be self-contained and easy to use, and can be easily integrated into larger Python programs to perform specific list manipulation tasks.
