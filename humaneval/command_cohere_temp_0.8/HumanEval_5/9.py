```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in numbers if x != delimeter]
    return delimeter + result if result else []
```

The function takes in two parameters, `numbers`, which is a list of integers, and `delimeter`, which is the number to be interspersed between consecutive elements in the `numbers` list. It works by first filtering out the `delimeter` values from the `numbers` list using a list comprehension, creating a new list that includes all elements of `numbers` except for the `delimeter`s. If the resulting list is empty (meaning there are no non-`delimeter` elements in `numbers`), it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it returns the list of non-delimeter values, followed by a single instance of the `delimeter`, thereby achieving the required interspersed format. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)
[1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
>>> intersperse([0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10], 12)
[0, 12, 2, 12, 4, 12, 6, 12, 8, 12, 10]
>>> intersperse([7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], 7)
[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]
```
