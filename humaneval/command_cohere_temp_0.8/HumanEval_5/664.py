```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in numbers if x != delimeter]
    return delimeter + result if result else []
```

The function takes in two parameters, `numbers`, which is a list of integers, and `delimeter`, which is the number to be placed in between each consecutive number in the `numbers` list. The function checks if the `numbers` list contains the `delimeter` value. If the `delimeter` is not present, it returns the list as is. If the `delimeter` is present, it will add the `delimeter` to the beginning and end of the list and remove the occurrences of the `delimeter` from the list and return the modified list.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> intersperse([], 4)
[]
>>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)
[1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
>>> intersperse([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 10)
[1, 10, 2, 10, 3, 10, 4, 10, 5]
``` 

This will return the list `[1, 10, 2, 10, 3, 10, 4, 10, 5]`, where 10 has been interspersed between each consecutive pair of numbers in the provided list.
