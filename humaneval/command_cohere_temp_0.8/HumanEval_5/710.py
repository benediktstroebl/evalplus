```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in numbers if x != delimeter]
    return delimeter + result if result else []
```

The function takes in two parameters, `numbers`, which is a list of integers, and `delimeter`, which is the number to be placed between consecutive elements of the `numbers` list. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list, `result`, which includes the elements of `numbers` but excludes the `delimeter` value. 

If `result` is empty, meaning no numbers were in the list except for `delimeter` (edge case: `numbers` was empty or consisted of only `delimeter` values), it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it returns `result` concatenated with a single instance of `delimeter`, thereby achieving the required interspersed effect. 

This solution has a time complexity of `O(n)` and a space complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the `numbers` list.
