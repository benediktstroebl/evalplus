```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in numbers if x != delimeter]
    return delimeter + result if result else []
```

The function takes in two parameters, `numbers`, which is a list of integers, and `delimeter`, which is the number to be placed between consecutive elements of the `numbers` list. It works by first filtering out the `delimeter` values from the `numbers` list using a list comprehension, thereby creating a new list `result`. The function then appends the `delimeter` to this `result` list to get the desired output. The resultant solution efficiently inserts the `delimeter` between every two consecutive elements of the `numbers` list, thereby achieving the desired result.
