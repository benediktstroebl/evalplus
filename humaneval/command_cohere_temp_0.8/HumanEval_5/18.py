```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimiter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = [x for x in numbers if x != delimiter]
    result.extend([delimiter] * (len(numbers) - len(result)))
    return result
``` 

The function takes in a list of numbers `numbers` and an interspersing delimiter `delimiter` as arguments. It filters out the delimiter from the list and calculates the total number of delimiters required to intersperse among the remaining elements. Subsequently, it extends the `result` list by the necessary number of delimiters and returns the modified list. 

This approach ensures that the function works correctly even if the input list consists solely of the delimiter, in which case it returns an empty list. Furthermore, it avoids unnecessary modifications by only appending delimiters to the result list when necessary.
