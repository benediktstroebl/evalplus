This script contains two functions:
- The `count_consonants` function, counts the number of consonants in an input word.
- The `select_words` function, splits the input string `s` into a list of words (`words`). Then, it iterates over each word in the list, checking if the count of consonants in each word matches the provided `n` using the `count_consonants` function. Finally, it returns a list of all the words that have exactly `n` consonants as per the problem's requirements. 

The provided example shows the correct operation of the script when processing the test example.
