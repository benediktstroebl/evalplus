The `count_consonants` function is a utility function that accurately counts the number of consonants in a given word. This function is essential for solving this problem, as it breaks down each character in the word and determines if it is a consonant or a vowel. 

The `select_words` takes a line (split by spaces) and splits it into words. It then proceeds to filter the words that have exactly `n` consonants using the `count_consonants` function.

Both functions are designed to efficiently solve the task required, and the code is formatted and commented to enhance readability and understanding. 

This script would yield the following results:
```
select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) ==> ["little"]
select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) ==> ["Mary", "lamb"]
select_words("simple white space", 2) ==> []
select_words("Hello world", 4) ==> ["world"]
select_words("Uncle sam", 3) ==> ["Uncle"]
```

This script is also designed to be robust and handle edge cases, such as an empty string or invalid inputs, without any errors.
