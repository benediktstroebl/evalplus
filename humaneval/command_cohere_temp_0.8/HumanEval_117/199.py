```python
def count_consonants(word):
    """
    This function counts the number of consonants in a given word.
    consonants are letters that are not vowels from the English alphabet
    """
    vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u", "A", "E", "I", "O", "U"]
    count = 0
    for letter in word:
        if letter not in vowels:
            count += 1
    return count

def select_words(s, n):
    """
    This function takes a string s and an integer n, returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.
    If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
    """
    words = []
    for space in s.split():
        if count_consonants(space) == n:
            words.append(space)
    return words

```
The above code contains two functions:
1. The 'count_consonants' function: This function takes a word as input and returns the number of consonants present in that word. Consonants are defined as characters that are not vowels. The definition of vowels is hard-coded in the function (it's a list of vowels in uppercase and lowercase), and the total count of consonants is calculated by simply iterating over the characters in the input word and incrementing a counter for each character that is not a vowel.
2. The 'select_words' function: This function takes two inputs: a string s and an integer n. It returns a list of all the words from string s that contain exactly n consonants. The function first splits the input string s into a list of spaces (assuming spaces separate words), then iterates over this list, and for each word, it calls the 'count_consonants' function to check if the number of consonants in that word matches the required number n. If it does, the word is added to the 'words' list. Finally, the function returns this list of qualified words.

The code solves the problem using the `count_consonants` function which accurately counts the consonants, and through these two functions, it is able to pass the test cases provided in the prompt.
