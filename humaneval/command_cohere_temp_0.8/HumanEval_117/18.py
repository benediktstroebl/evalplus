```python
def count_consonants(word):
    ct = 0
    for char in word:
        if char != 'a' and char != 'e' and char != 'i' and char != 'o' and char != 'u':
            ct += 1
    return ct
    
def select_words(s, n):
    words = s.split()
    result = []
    for word in words:
        ct = count_consonants(word)
        if ct == n:
            result.append(word)
    return result
```
The main approach of the well-optimized solution is to separately count the consonants for each word, and then select the words that have exactly n consonants.

Here is an example usage of the function for the input "Mary had a little lamb", n = 4:
```python
print(select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4))
```
This would output:
```python
['little']
```
