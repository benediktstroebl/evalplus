# Test cases
print(select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4))     # Output: ["little"]
print(select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3))     # Output: ["Mary", "lamb"]
print(select_words("simple white space", 2))       # Output: []
print(select_words("Hello world", 4))             # Output: ["world"]
print(select_words("Uncle sam", 3))               # Output: ["Uncle"]

This Python script splits the input string into individual words, filters out special characters, and counts the number of consonants in each word using the `count_cons` function. It then adds the word to the result list if the count is equal to the specified number of consonants `n`. The code includes test cases to validate its functionality against the problem statement's examples. 

Let's break down the solution further:
1. **Function `count_cons`**:** This function takes a single argument `word`, which is a string. It counts the number of consonants in the word using a loop. The variable `cons` is incremented each time a letter that is not a vowel (uppercase or lowercase) is encountered. The function returns the count of consonants in the word.
2. **Function `select_words`**:** This function takes two arguments, a string `s` and an integer `n`. It returns a list of words from the string `s` that contain exactly `n` consonants. The function first checks if the input string is empty, and if so, it returns an empty list. It then loops through the words in the input string, calculating the number of consonants in each word using the `count_cons` function. If the count matches the specified `n`, the word is added to the list `words`. The function ultimately returns this list of selected words.
3. **Test Cases**: The code includes several test cases to validate the correctness of the `select_words` function against different scenarios. Each test case prints the returned list, allowing you to verify if the function is correctly selecting words with the desired number of consonants. 
This solution is efficient and well-structured, making it a good fit for the problem statement. It's important to ensure that the solution works correctly for words that include vowels, as well as special characters, and that it handles edge cases like an empty input string properly.
