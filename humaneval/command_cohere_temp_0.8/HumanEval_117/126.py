This Python script solves the problem using two functions. The first function, `count_consonants`, counts the number of consonants in a given word. The second function, `select_words`, takes a string and a natural number as input and returns a list of all the words that contain exactly `n` consonants, in the order they appear in the string. This list is then returned. These two functions allow us to solve the problem and match the test cases precisely.
