This script provides a recursive implementation to solve the problem. The helper function `count_consonants` is used to determine the current count of consonants in a word. The recursive implementation progressively extracts words from the given string `s` and checks, through the use of the helper function, whether the current word contains `n` consonants. If it does, this word is added to a list of results and returned eventually. If it does not, the function continues searching in the following words. An empty list is returned if the string is empty. 

The tests passed with this code indicate the correctness of the implementation. 
If you encounter any issues or wish to further refine the solution, feel free to let me know.  It is important to ensure that the function is appropriately tested and meets the requirements of the problem.
