```

This code defines two functions:
1. `count_consonants`: Determines the number of consonants in a given word.
2. `select_words`: Accepts a string and an integer as input, then returns a list of words containing exactly "n" consonants, as required by the problem. This function also handles the case where the input string is empty.

The provided examples are correct and illustrate the intended behavior of the `select_words` function.
