This Python script defines two functions. The first function, `count_consonants`, calculates the number of consonants in a given word. Since the problem assumes the input string contains only letters and spaces, the function ignores spaces and checks if each letter is a consonant or a vowel. The second function, `select_words`, accepts a string and an integer as input and returns a list of all the words in the string containing exactly n consonants. It accomplishes this by splitting the input string into words and iterating through each word, checking its consonant count using the previous function. If a word has exactly n consonants, it's added to the result list, which is returned once all words have been processed.

The test cases printed in the code above prove the correctness of the functions, ensuring they handle various scenarios and meet the problem requirements.
