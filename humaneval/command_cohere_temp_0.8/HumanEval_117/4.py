Here's a Python script that contains a function called `select_words` which solves the problem statement. The function takes a string `s` and an integer `n` as input and returns a list of all words from the string `s` that contain exactly `n` consonants. The function assumes the input string contains only letters and spaces:
```python
def select_words(s, n):
    '''
    Given a string s and a natural number n, return a list of all words from string s that contain exactly n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.
    If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
    Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.
    '''
    # empty case
    if not s:
        return []
    # dictionary to count consonants
    d = {}
    consonants = 'bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ'
    words = []
    
    # iterate over spaces to get words
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == ' ':
            word = s[0:i]
            if len(word) == 0:
                continue
            # count consonants
            c = 0
            for letter in word:
                if letter in consonants:
                    c += 1
            # store word and count
            if c == 0 or (c>0 and c==n):
                words.append(word)
            # reset count
            c = 0
    return words
```

The script works as follows:
- It defines a function `select_words` that takes in a string `s` and an integer `n` as parameters.
- It checks if the input string is empty, and if so, returns an empty list.
- It initializes a dictionary `d` to count consonants, and a string `consonants` that contains all possible consonants.
- It also initializes an empty list `words` that will store the selected words.
- It iterates over each space in the input string, using it as a word boundary.
- For each word, it counts the number of consonants in the word, and adds the word to the list if it contains exactly `n` consonants or if the word has no consonants (i.e., it is a vowel-only word).
- The function returns the list of selected words.

This solution is efficient because each word is processed only once, and the consonant count is computed directly on each iteration. Also, the solution is logarithmic with respect to the number of characters in the input string because the potentially longest possible word length is bounded by the total length of the input string minus the total number of spaces. And at each space, the function starts processing a new word with no carryover of state or memory from the previous word processing. Hence the complexity is O(n) where n is the total length of the input string. 

Overall, the script is a self-contained Python program that solves the problem using a efficient algorithm, and it can be easily copied and run to test out various input strings and test cases.
