# Test Cases
def test_select_words():
    assert select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) == ["Mary", "lamb"]
    assert select_words("simple white space", 2) == []
    assert select_words("Hello world", 4) == ["world"]
    assert select_words("Uncle sam", 3) == ["Uncle"]
    assert select_words("Hello World Hello", 4) == ["World"]

test_select_words()
```

The function `count_consonants` is added to efficiently compute the number of consonants in a word, this is a recursive solution. The main function `select_words` splits the string into a list of words, then iterates through each word, checking if its consonant count matches the required count `n`, if it does, the word is added to the result list. Finally, the list of test cases is called to validate the solution. 

The overall time complexity of this solution is `O(n + m)` where `n` is the number of words and `m` is the maximum length of a word (assuming all words have equal length for simplicity). The solution is highly efficient and scalable.
