The provided Python script defines a function `hex_key` that solves the problem as described in the markdown code block. This function takes a hexadecimal number as an input in decimal notation and counts the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes. 

The script also features a function `is_prime`, which checks whether a given number is a prime or not. This function is used by `hex_key` to determine if a digit is prime or not. 

Furthermore, the script encompasses a series of test cases that verify the behavior of the `hex_key` function. These test cases cover a range of scenarios, including both valid and invalid inputs. 

Note: Conversion to decimal notation is done to match hexadecimal digits to their corresponding decimal digits when checking for primality, and then convert the result back to hexadecimal notation after computing. 
The script assumes that the input is always correct or empty string, and symbols A, B, C, D, E, F are always uppercase. 
It is always a good practice to test your code with many different inputs to ensure robustness and accuracy. 
```python
test_cases = [
    ("AB", 1),
    ("1077E", 2),
    ("ABED1A33", 4),
    ("123456789ABCDEF0", 6),
    ("2020", 2)
]
``` 

Running the provided test cases will validate the accuracy of the `hex_key` function in determining the count of hexadecimal digits that are primes.
