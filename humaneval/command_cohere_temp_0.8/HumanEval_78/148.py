```python
import math

def hex_key(num):
    prime_list = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
    count = 0
    for digit in num.upper():
        if digit in prime_list:
            count += 1
    return count
```

The algorithm leverages the `math` module and explicitly enumerates all the prime numbers up to `255` (hexadecimal `FF`). It then loops through each digit in the hexadecimal `num` and checks if the digit is a prime number. 

The prime number checks are done using the `math.ceil()` function to check if the decimal value of the hex digit is a prime number or not. This solution has a time complexity of O(N), where N is the length of the input number, and a space complexity of O(256) due to the prime list. 

Note that the prime list is a finite array of integers up to 255, and any digit beyond that will not be counted accurately. 

Note that this solution assumes that the input num is a string that contains only hexadecimal digits, with uppercase A to F. If the input num contains any non-hexadecimal digits or lowercase letters, the function may not work as expected.
