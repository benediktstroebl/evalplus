```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    """Check is n is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def hex_key(num):
    """Count the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes."""
    digits = '0123456789ABCDEF'
    count = 0
    for digit in num:
        if digit in digits and is_prime(int(digit)):
            count += 1
    return count
```

The approach uses a simple algorithm to check primality for a given number n. The algorithm loops from 2 to int(n**0.5) + 1 and checks if n is divisible by any number in this range. 

For the given test suite, this algorithm provides an adequate performance solution for the problem. 

However, note that the algorithm is not suited for checking the primality of larger numbers, as it requires disproportionate resources compared to more sophisticated algorithms. 

Such a simple approach is suited to solve the problem statement for this task, but for more performant testing, you might want to look into implementing more specialized algorithms like the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
