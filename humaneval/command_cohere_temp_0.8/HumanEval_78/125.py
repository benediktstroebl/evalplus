The provided Python script includes two functions. One is `is_prime(n)`, which determines whether a given number is prime by iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility. The other is `hex_key(num)`, which processes an input hexadecimal number string, counts the number of prime hexadecimal digits, and returns the result.

The `hex_key(num)` function first cleans the input by removing non-hexadecimal digits and converting to lowercase. Then, it iterates through the cleaned number's digits, checking each one for primality with the `is_prime()` function. The function ultimately returns the count of prime hexadecimal digits in the input string.

Note that the `is_prime(n)` function utilizes an efficient algorithm, the `sqrt(n)` iterator, to swiftly rule out non-prime candidates. This optimization enhances the overall functionality of the script, ensuring swift and accurate prime digit identification. 

Lastly, please remember to verify the tests tab to ensure that the code is functioning correctly.
