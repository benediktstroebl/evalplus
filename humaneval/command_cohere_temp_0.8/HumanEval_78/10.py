This script includes a list of prime numbers from 2 to 37 for the sake of shortness and faster searching. 
The `re.search()` function is used to validate user input and make sure it contains only digits and letters.

The script assumes the input is a string and has no dependencies on external modules. 

The problem statement indicates that the following digits are of interest: `2`, `3`, `5`, `7`, `11` (which is represented as `B` in hexadecimal), `13` (which is represented as `D` in hexadecimal). The script counts how many digits in the provided hexadecimal number are primes or represent primes. 

Note that the script assumes the input is a string and has no dependencies on external modules. 
It also prints the result immediately instead of returning it through a return statement.  if you want to modify the output behavior, you can replace the `print` statement with a return statement to return the value defined by `count`.  Also, the list of prime numbers can be extended for more comprehensive solutions.  Finally, this code can benefit from handling potential exceptions to provide cleaner and safer code.  These are things you may consider to make your code more robust and secure.
