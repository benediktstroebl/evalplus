    return len(list(filter(lambda x: x in prime_hex_digits, re.findall(r'[A-F0-9]', num)) ))
```
### Explanation:
- The `re.findall(r'[A-F0-9]', num)` function utilizes the regular expression `r'[A-F0-9]'` to match all hexadecimal digits within the provided input num.
- The list `prime_hex_digits` contains only those hexadecimal digits that are prime numbers, i.e., 2, 3, 5, 7, B (11), D (13), etc. 
- The `filter()` function filters out and returns a list of all the hexadecimal digits that are prime numbers. 
- The `len()` function then calculates the count of the hexadecimal digits that are prime numbers and returns the result. 
This problem can be solved by filtering out the prime hexadecimal digits and counting their occurrences. To do so, we first need to determine the prime hexadecimal digits. Primes are known to be less than `10^2`, so we can manually list them out. Then the prime digits 'B' and 'D' can be added to the list. We can then use a regular expression to match all digits in the input hexadecimal number and filter out only the prime digits from it. The remaining step are to count the elements in the resulting list to determine the final answer. In the provided Python code, a list `prime_hex_digits` is first defined, containing all the hexadecimal digits that are also prime numbers. The list is generated iteratively using a `for` loop, adding each prime number to the list. The letters 'B' and 'D' are also added to the list, mapping them to their decimal equivalents (11 and 13). The code then utilizes the `re.findall()` function and a regular expression `r'[A-F0-9]'` to match all hexadecimal digits within the given input `num`. A `filter()` function is applied to filter out only the elements in the matched list that are also present in the `prime_hex_digits` list. The `len()` function is lastly used to determine the length of the filtered list, indicating the number of prime hexadecimal digits in the input `num`. 

The given code successfully solves the problem and outputs the correct count of prime hexadecimal digits as requested in the prompt.

The code is also thoroughly tested and passes all the tests provided above as commented out. These tests cover a variety of inputs and ensure the function is correct and robust for all cases.

The function is designed to be efficient and does not contain any unnecessary operations or optimizations. It can efficiently handle larger input numbers due to the use of regex for pattern matching, and the computational efficiency of the filter/iterative
