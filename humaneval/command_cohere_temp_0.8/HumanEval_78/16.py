The code first removes all non-hexadecimal characters from the input string and converts each character to its uppercase counterpart. For example, non-hexadecimal characters are removed from '123456789ABCDEF0', leaving '1234567890ABCDEF'. 

Next, the function converts this string to integers for prime checking. This is done to facilitate the call to the `is_prime` function, which checks whether a given number is prime. 

Then, the function counts the number of digits that are prime, and returns this count.

The `is_prime` function is a simple primality test that checks if a number is less than or equal to 1, it returns `False`. It then iterates from 2 up to the square root of the number and checks if the number is divisible by any of these integers. If the number is divisible by any of them, it returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, it means the number is prime, and the function returns `True`. 

You can test the code by calling the `hex_key` function with a variety of strings as input. 

For example:
```python
print(hex_key("2020")) # 2
print(hex_key("AB"))  # 1
print(hex_key("1077E")) # 2
print(hex_key("ABED1A33")) # 4
print(hex_key("123456789ABCDEF0")) # 6
```
The output will be:
```
2
1
2
4
6
```
This shows that the `hex_key` function correctly counts the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes. 
Remember to keep your code well-organized and optimized for performance, especially when dealing with prime testing, as this can potentially involve very large numbers. 

To optimize the `is_prime` function, we can note that the loop starts from 2, and for each iteration, we divide the number by 2. This means that we can optimize the function by only checking up to the square root of the number, instead of checking all numbers up to the number itself.
