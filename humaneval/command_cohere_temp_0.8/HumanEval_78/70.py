The `is_prime` function is used to determine if a number is prime. It iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number and checks for divisibility. If the number is divisible by any integer within this range, it is not prime; otherwise, it is considered prime. This function is then used within the `hex_key` function to check each digit of the hexadecimal number and count the prime digits. 

The `hex_key` function converts the hexadecimal number to a decimal number and then iterates through the decimal representation, extracting the remainder of each division by 16 and accumulating the digits in a list. It then applies the `is_prime` function to each digit and counts the number of prime digits. 

The provided example tests pass, demonstrating the correct operation of the `hex_key` function. You can integrate it into your project, and it should work well for the specified problem. If you encounter any difficulties or require further refinement, feel free to ask.
