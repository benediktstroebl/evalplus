The approach used by the `hex_key()` function above is:
1. It first converts each digit of the hexadecimal number to its decimal representation.
2. It then checks for each of these decimal digits if it's a prime number using the `is_prime()` function.
3. Finally, it counts and returns the number of digits that are prime.

The `is_prime()` function is a simple prime-checking function that uses the `range()` function to iterate through numbers from 2 to the square root of the number and checks for divisibility.

This script includes the `is_prime()` function, which can be used to check if a number is prime or not and returns True if the number is prime and False otherwise. The `hex_key()` function uses `is_prime()` to check if each digit of the hexadecimal number is prime. 

Note that the `hex_key()` function assumes that the input is always correct or empty strings, and symbols A, B, C, D, E, F are always uppercase, as stated in the problem statement. 

You can test this script by calling `hex_key()` with different hexadecimal numbers to count the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes.  For example:
```python
print(hex_key("AB"))  # Output: 1
print(hex_key("1077E"))  # Output: 2
print(hex_key("ABED1A33"))  # Output: 4
print(hex_key("123456789ABCDEF0"))  # Output: 6
print(hex_key("2020"))  # Output: 2
``` 

This script provides a solution to the problem and passes the corresponding tests as requested.  It's self-contained, meaning it doesn't depend on any external libraries or modules other than the Python standard library.  If you have any tests or further requests, feel free to add them.
