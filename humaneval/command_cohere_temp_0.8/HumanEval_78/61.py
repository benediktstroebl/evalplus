def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def hex_key(num):
    """Count the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes."""
    # convert hex string to decimal numbers
    num = int(num, 16)
    digits = []
    while num:
        digit = num % 16
        digits.append(digit)
        num //= 16
    # Count non-zero digits that are prime
    count = sum(1 for digit in digits if digit and is_prime(digit))
    return count
```

The solution applies a rolling-summary approach, converting the hexadecimal number to decimal temporarily to identify each of its digits and determine their primality. Subsequently, it counts the digits that are not only non-zero but also prime, as specified by the problem. 

This approach results in a linear time complexity of O(N), where N is the length of the input number in hexadecimal digits, making the solution efficient for reasonably sized inputs. 

The `is_prime` helper function is utilized to efficiently check if a given number is prime, implementing a streamlined version of the [Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes). 

To further optimize memory usage, one could reserve the memory needed for the decimal conversion only once, instead of re-allocating it for each iteration step. This would be a micro-optimization though, and unlikely to make a substantial difference for reasonably sized inputs. 

For the case of large inputs, contributing to potentially lengthy prime checks, one could explore more sophisticated optimizations or prime-number libraries. However, such sophistication exceeds the scope of this problem and would be required only if the input size were excessively large. 

Note: Some highly optimized prime-number libraries employ sophisticated methodologies and pre-computed datasets to perform primality checks extremely efficiently. These are typically geared towards large numbers, and their memory usage and installation complexity may not make them ideal for a problem of this scale.
