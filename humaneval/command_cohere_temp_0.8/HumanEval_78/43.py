The problem specification mentions that prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. However, for the sake of brevity, the function `hex_key` includes a list of prime numbers up to 29 only. If required to evaluate numbers beyond this limit, the list can be extended. 

The `hex_key` function uses a regular expression to match a string containing only hexadecimal digits. The regular expression pattern `'[A-F0-9]+'` matches any string that consists of one or more uppercase alphanumeric characters. 

The function then iterates over the matched digits, converts each digit to an integer, and checks if the integer is prime. The function returns the count of prime digits divided by the total number of digits to minimize the risk of division by zero and improve the result accuracy. 

The code includes a test suite with test cases ranging from a single digit to a larger string to validate the function.  Any test case that doesn't evaluate to truthy against the function would throw an error and be logged as such.
