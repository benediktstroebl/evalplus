The `hex_key` function uses two internal functions:
- The `is_prime` function checks if a given number is prime. Being prime means the number is greater than 1 and cannot be divided by any other number except for 1 and itself. The function iterates through all numbers from 2 to the square root of the number and checks for divisibility. If the number is divisible by any other number in that range, it returns `False`. If not, it returns `True`.
- The `find` method is used to find the first occurrence of a specific character in a string. In this case, it is used to locate the position of the digit in the hexadecimal string. 

Then the `hex_key` function iterates through each digit in the `digits` list and checks if the digit is present in the input hexadecimal string. 
For each matching digit
- It finds its position in the string (`index`)
- Removes the digit and all the subsequent digits from the string (`num`)
- Checks if the removed digit is a prime digit using the `is_prime` function. 

Finally, the function returns the number of prime digits.

The expected output for each test case is provided below:
```
For num = "AB", the output should be 1
```

Testing the function on the input `num = "AB"` should return the following:
```
1
```

```
For num = "1077E", the output should be 2
```

Testing the function on the input `num = "1077E"` should return the following:
```
2
```

```
For num = "ABED1A33", the output should be 4
```

Testing the function on the input `num = "ABED1A33"` should return the following:
```
4
```

```
For num = "123456789ABCDEF0", the output should be 6
```

Testing the function on the input `num = "123456789ABCDEF0"` should return the following:
```
6
```

```
For num = "2020", the output should be 2
```

Testing the function on the input `num = "2020"` should return the following:
```
2
``` 

This problem can be solved using different approaches such as:
- **String Matching Approach**: 
The mechanical method involves checking each digit in the number to see if it is prime. This can be done by simply matching each digit in the number
