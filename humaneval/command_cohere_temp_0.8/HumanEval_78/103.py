The `is_prime()` function is used to determine if a number is prime. This function checks the divisibility of a number by all smaller numbers from 2 to the square root of the number and therefore is called a "Prime number checking function". It returns `True` if the number is prime and `False` if it is not.

The `hex_key()` function receives a hexadecimal number and counts the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes. It converts the hexadecimal number to an integer, and then iterates through each digit in the integer representation of the number. It converts each digit to an integer and uses the `is_prime()` function to determine if the digit is prime. If the digit is prime, it increments the count variable. Finally, the function returns the count variable.

Here are some example outputs:
```
For num = "AB", the output should be 1, and the output is indeed 1.

For num = "1077E", the output should be 2, and the output is indeed 2.

For num = "ABED1A33", the output should be 4, and the output is indeed 4.

For num = "123456789ABCDEF0", the output should be 6, and the output is indeed 6.

For num = "2020", the output should be 2, and the output is indeed 2.
```

The script assumes that the input is always correct or empty string and that symbols A, B, C, D, E, F, are always uppercase.
