def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is a prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def hex_key(num):
    """Count the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes."""
    # your code here
    count = 0
    num = str(num)
    # Assuming the input is always correct or empty string
    # removing 'A', 'B', ... 'F' from the string and converting 
    # to integer to work with built-in is_prime function
    for char in list(num):
        if char.isupper() and char in 'ABCDEF':
            num = num.replace(char, str(int(char) - ord('A') + 10))
    for digit in str(num):
        if is_prime(int(digit)):
            count += 1
    return count
```

The code first removes the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F' from the string and converts them to their decimal representation (base 10) to work with the built-in `is_prime` function. For example, 'A' is converted to 10, 'B' to 11, and so on. Then, the code iterates over each digit of the converted number and checks if it is prime. Finally, the total count of prime digits is returned. 

This solution employs only the built-in `is_prime` function and textbook algorithms, thus achieving a relatively efficient and readable codebase.  If you would like to optimize it further or discuss other approaches, please provide additional details on the desired requirements.
