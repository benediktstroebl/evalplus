```

The provided solution leverages the `is_prime` function to filter out primes among hexadecimal digits, converting the hexadecimal string to an integer for easier processing. Using `str(num)` allows us to iterate through each digit of the number. The `isupper()` method helps to identify uppercase letters, filtering out digits A to F. Finally, the `count` variable keeps track of the prime digits. 

The `is_prime` helper function follows a simple primality-checking algorithm, iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility. If the number is less than or equal to 1, or any divisor is found, it is marked as not prime. 

The provided code includes corresponding tests, ensuring the correctness of the solution in accordance with the problem statement. Adjustments might be needed when applying the solution to other tests or contexts.
