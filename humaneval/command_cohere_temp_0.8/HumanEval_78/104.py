```python
import math

def hex_key(num):
    prime_hex = ['2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D']
    count = 0
    for digit in num:
        if digit in prime_hex:
            count += 1
    return count
```

The algorithm employs a list `prime_hex`, encapsulating all hexadecimal digits that are prime numbers. The function `hex_key` iterates through each digit in the hexadecimal number, determining if the digit appears in the `prime_hex` list. Whenever a match is found, the `count` variable is incremented, resulting in the total count of prime hexadecimal digits present in the input number.

Here is a simple unit test to ensure the function `hex_key` is accurate:
```python
test_cases = [("AB", 1), ("1077E", 2), ("ABED1A33", 4), ("123456789ABCDEF0", 6), ("2020", 2)]

for num, expected in test_cases:
    result = hex_key(num)
    assert result == expected, f"For the input {num}, expected {expected}, but got {result}"
```

This test suite validates the function's behavior against a variety of inputs, ensuring that each result aligns with the expected count of prime hexadecimal digits.
