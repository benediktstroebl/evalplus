def hex_key(num):
    """Count the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes."""
    digits = "0123456789ABCDEF"
    count = 0
    for char in num:
        if char.isupper():
            digit = digits.find(char)
        else:
            digit = int(char)
        if is_prime(digit):
            count += 1
    return count
```

The solution works by first converting all hexadecimal digits to their numeric value, checking if they are primes, and counting them. The `is_prime` function is used to check if a given number is prime. This function uses a optimized approach called the `Sieve of Eratosthenes` that efficiently finds all prime numbers smaller than N when you need to check a large number of integers for primality. 

The `hex_key` function starts by iterating through each character in the input string `num`, if the character is uppercase it uses the `find` method to get its numeric value within the string `digits`, if the character is lowercase it is already in numeric form, so it is converted to an integer. Then the `is_prime` function is used to check if the digit is prime, and if it is, it gets added to the count. Finally, the function returns the total count of prime hexadecimal digits.
