```python
import math

def hex_key(num):
    prime_digits = set(['2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'])
    count = 0
    for digit in num.upper():
        if digit in prime_digits:
            count += 1
    return count
```

The algorithm employs a `for` loop to traverse each digit in the hexadecimal number and checks if the digit is a prime digit or not using a predefined set of prime hexadecimal digits. It updates the count variable for every prime digit found. The function returns the total count of prime digits thereby solving the problem.

This solution works for all the cases mentioned in the problem statement. You can test the algorithm with other problem-solving contexts to establish its versatility. 
The code is optimized for efficiency, and the time complexity is O(N), where N represents the number of digits in the input hexadecimal number. 

To test the code, save it in a `.py` file and execute it using a Python interpreter. You can assert the function's behavior by calling it with different input values and comparing the output with the expected results. Here is an example: 
```python
input_num = "AB"
expected_output = 1
actual_output = hex_key(input_num)

print(f"{input_num} : {expected_output} : {actual_output}")
```
The output will be:
```
AB : 1 : 1
``` 
This validates the function behavior for the provided example.
