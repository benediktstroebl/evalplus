    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def hex_key(num):
    """Count the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes."""
    # Convert hexadecimal string to decimal numbers
    num = [int(d) for d in num.upper()]
    count = 0
    for n in num:
        # Check if the current digit is not a prime
        if not is_prime(n):
            continue
        # Count digits that are primes, skip duplicates
        for d in range(0, 16):
            if d == n:
                continue
            if is_prime(d):
                count += 1
    return count
```

The `is_prime` function uses a basic primality test to check if a given number is prime or not. The `hex_key` function converts the input hexadecimal string to decimal numbers, then loops through each digit checking each digit to see if it is prime. It also checks each digit for duplicates, skipping any duplicates found. The function then returns the count of unique primes found in the input string.

This solution assumes that the input is always correct or empty, and all symbols are in uppercase.

You can test this function using `pytest`. You can simply add this function to a `pytest` test file and it should work seamlessly. Here's an example:
```python
import pytest

def test_hex_key():
    assert hex_key("AB") == 1
    assert hex_key("1077E") == 2
    assert hex_key("ABED1A33") == 4
    assert hex_key("123456789ABCDEF0") == 6
    assert hex_key("2020") == 2
```

This will execute the function 4 times with different inputs, checking for the expected output. 

The primality test is a basic and efficient test that is suited for testing a large number of inputs, but is not guaranteed to catch all prime numbers. There are more advanced tests like the Sieve of Eratosthenes that are more efficient but are more complex and are overkill for this particular problem.
