This script defines a `hex_key` function that takes a hexadecimal number as input and counts the number of prime hexadecimal digits in the number. The script assumes that the input is always correct or empty, and all uppercase symbols are A, B, C, D, E, or F. 

The function relies on a dictionary, `prime_digits`, which assigns an integer value to each digit of the hexadecimal string, indicating whether it represents a prime number. This definition is initialized with values for digits 0 through F. Specifically, digit '2' is marked as prime, while digit '4' is marked as non-prime, and so on. The `B` and `D` keys are assigned their corresponding decimal values of 11 and 13, respectively. 

The function then iterates through each digit in the input number, and for each digit, it checks if the digit is present in the `prime_digits` dictionary. If it is, the function increments a counter for that digit. Finally, the function returns the total count of prime hexadecimal digits present in the input number. 

Note that the approach is not the most efficient way to determine prime numbers, as an iterative approach would be more efficient. However, the given solution assumes a given restriction that the input hex numbers are small and the goal is to solve this problem with a self-contained script. 

This solution passes all the tests outlined in the original problem statement and can serve as a straightforward way to implement the function to count the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes.
