The code defines a function `hex_key` that takes a string `num` representing a hexadecimal number as input and counts the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes. 

The function first checks if the input string is empty, and if so, returns 0. It then iterates through each character in the string, ignoring lowercase hexadecimal digits as they are already treated as integers. For each uppercase character, it finds the digit's position in the hexadecimal digit dictionary and checks if it is a prime using the `is_prime` function.

The `is_prime` function is also included to check if a given number is prime. It implements a basic primality test by iterating from 2 up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility. If the number is divisible by any integer within this range, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The provided example tests are contained in the code to validate the `hex_key` function. These test cases cover different scenarios and verify that the function correctly counts the number of prime hexadecimal digits in various input hexadecimal numbers. 

The code should provide an accurate solution to the problem statement and pass all the tests.  It is important to make sure to run the code with a Python interpreter that has the math module installed, as it is imported in the solution and used in the is_prime function for the primality test. In Linux environments, it usually comes with the default installation of Python.
