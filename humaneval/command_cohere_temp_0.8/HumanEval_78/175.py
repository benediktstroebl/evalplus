```python
import math

def hex_key(num):
    prime_hex = ['2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D']
    count = 0
    for digit in num.upper():
        if digit in prime_hex:
            count += 1
    return count
```

The algorithm works by first converting the input hexadecimal string `num` to uppercase to make comparison case-insensitive. It then iterates through each digit in the string, checking each digit against a list of prime hexadecimal digits stored in the `prime_hex` list. If a digit is found to be prime, it increments the `count` variable. Finally, it returns the calculated count of prime hexadecimal digits.

This algorithm provides an efficient way to solve the problem by avoiding the need for unnecessary prime number calculations beyond what is required for the hexadecimal digits. The `prime_hex` list effectively stores the prime digits, making the iteration and count process more optimized and concise.
