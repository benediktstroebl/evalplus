The solution algorithm is as follows:
1. The `is_prime(n)` function checks whether a given number `n` is a prime or not. If the number is less than or equal to 1, it immediately returns `False`. If the number is greater than 1, it checks whether the number is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any number in this range, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. 
2. The `hex_key(num)` function takes a hexadecimal number as input and counts the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes. It first maps the uppercase hexadecimal digits to their decimal equivalents. Then, it iterates through each character in the input number  `num`, if the character is uppercase, it finds its decimal equivalent in the `digits` string. If the character is lowercase, it is treated as a decimal number. In both cases, it checks if the digit is prime using the `is_prime()` function. If the digit is prime, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the total count of prime hexadecimal digits. 

The tests confirm that the function behaves as expected on a variety of inputs. You can add these test cases for more thorough testing:
1. Test with a large number of hexadecimal digits to ensure the performance is as expected.
2. Test with strings that have both uppercase and lowercase characters.
3. Test with strings that have mixed hexadecimal digits as well as prime and non-prime digits. 
4. Test with strings that have a large number of prime hexadecimal digits to ensure the function accurately identifies all prime digits. Note that the execution time of the solution is proportional to `n` square root checks, where n is the number represented by the hexadecimal number. But this is hardly relevant for numbers of practical size.

This solution should handle all scenarios correctly and efficiently.
