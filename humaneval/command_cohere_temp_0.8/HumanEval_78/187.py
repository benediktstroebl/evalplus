```python
import math

def hex_key(num):
    prime_list = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
    count = 0
    for char in num.upper():
        if char in prime_list:
            count += 1
    return count
```

The code defines a Python function called `hex_key` that takes a string `num` as input. This function calculates the number of hexadecimal digits that are prime numbers in the given hexadecimal number and returns this count. It first creates a list called `prime_list` that contains the digits '2', '3', '5', '7', '11', '13', and '17', which are known prime numbers. The variable `count` is initialized to zero, which will be used to count the prime digits. The code then iterates through each character in the input string `num` and checks if the character is an uppercase letter. If the character is in the `prime_list`, it adds 1 to the count variable. Finally, the function returns the count, which represents the number of prime hexadecimal digits in the input number. 

Here is a straightforward test suite to ensure that the function behaves as expected:
```python
# Testing the function against known test cases
assert hex_key("AB") == 1
assert hex_key("1077E") == 2
assert hex_key("ABED1A33") == 4
assert hex_key("123456789ABCDEF0") == 6
assert hex_key("2020") == 2
```

The test suite contains different test cases to validate the correctness of the `hex_key` function. Each test case passes a specific input to the function and compares it with the expected output. The `assert` statement ensures that the test case passes only if the actual output matches the expected output.  If the function behaves as expected, all tests should pass without error.  This approach allows a quick check of the function's behavior on known inputs, ensuring it behaves as expected, and providing a basis for more extensive testing and validation.  You can use these tests as a starting point to ensure that your function behaves as expected on other inputs.  You can then extend this test suite with additional tests to cover a broad spectrum of input cases.  This approach helps ensure that the function remains correct throughout the development process and can catch any regressions that may occur during future changes or updates to the code.  This is a best practice in software development to write testable code and ensure a high-quality codebase.  It is also a necessary step to ensure that your code meets the requirements and expectations of the problem statement.  You can also use these tests as a starting point for further testing and validation to verify that your function behaves as expected on other inputs, including edge cases and corner cases.  This rigorous testing ensures that the function's behavior is reliable, predictable, and accurate, which is essential for the mathematical correctness of the code.  In addition, these tests can help you to avoid logical errors, oversights, or mistakes in your code, which would be very difficult and time-consuming to find and fix manually.  Finally, automatic tests accelerate the development process by enabling you to confidently change and improve your code, knowing that if something breaks, the tests will alert you.  This results in more efficient development, higher-quality code, and fewer bugs and issues in your software projects.  This is the value of automated testing and why it has become a standard software engineering best practice.  Overall, the test suite provides a robust foundation for ensuring the correctness of the `hex_key` function and helps maintain and assure the quality of the codebase in the
