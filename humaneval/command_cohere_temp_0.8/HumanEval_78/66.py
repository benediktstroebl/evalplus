This code defines the `hex_key` function that solves the problem as described. It checks each digit in the string if it's a hexadecimal digit (`digit in hex_digits`) and if it's prime (`is_prime(int(digit))`). The `is_prime` function is also provided to check if a number is prime or not. The code also includes a set of tests to verify the correctness of the `hex_key` function. You can copy and paste this code into a Python interpreter or save it into a file with the `.py` extension to run it. 

You can add more tests to this list to cover more cases and ensure the function's behavior over a range of inputs.
