The provided Python script defines a function `hex_key` that solves the problem statement. It accepts a hexadecimal number as input and counts the number of hexadecimal digits that are prime numbers.

The script also includes a helper function, `is_prime`, which checks whether a given number is prime or not. It iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number and checks for divisibility. If the number is divisible by any integer within this range, it returns `False`, indicating that the number is not prime. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is prime.

The main function `hex_key` iterates through each digit of the input hexadecimal number and checks if it's a prime digit. If it is, the `count` variable is incremented. Finally, the function returns the count of prime hexadecimal digits.

The test cases provided in the Problem Statement are executed successfully, confirming the accuracy of the script. You can use it to solve the problem and count the prime hexadecimal digits in any given hexadecimal number.
