The code defines a function `hex_key` that takes a string `num` as input and counts the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes. 

The script assumes that the input will only contain hexadecimal digits, spaces, or empty strings, and symbols 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F' are always uppercase. 

To pass the test, the code also checks if the input is an empty string or not, and returns 0 in the case of an empty string as there are no digits to count. 

The code uses a regular expression `re.sub()` to clean the input from any characters that are not hexadecimal digits or spaces. 

Finally, the code iterates over the digits of the string, and for each hexadecimal digit, it checks if the digit is a prime number or not, and accordingly, it increments the variable `count`. 

The script assumes that the prime numbers listed in the `primes` list are the only prime hexadecimal digits. You can add or remove digits from the list if needed. 

The code was tested with the provided example cases, and accordingly, it was able to pass all three tests.  For example, for the input `num = "AB"`, the output will be `1` as the digit 'B' is a prime.
