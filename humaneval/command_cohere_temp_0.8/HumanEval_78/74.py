The provided Python script defines a function `hex_key` that takes a string `num` as input and counts the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes. The script also includes a separate function `is_prime` to check if a given number is a prime. 

To ensure maximum accuracy, the `is_prime` function iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number and checks for divisibility. If the number is divisible by any integer within this range, it is not a prime. 

The `hex_key` function utilizes the `is_prime` function to accurately determine the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes. The given examples in the comment are then used to test the function. 

You can verify that the script accurately solves the problem by checking the output for the given examples:
- For the input "AB", the output should be 1. The function returns 1, which is correct.
- For the input "1077E", the output should be 2. The function returns 2, which is correct.
- For the input "ABED1A33", the output should be 4. The function returns 4, which is correct.
- For the input "123456789ABCDEF0", the output should be 6. The function returns 6, which is correct.
- For the input "2020", the output should be 2. The function returns 2, which is correct. 

This script provides an effective solution to the problem and demonstrates the use of prime checking algorithms in a programming context.
