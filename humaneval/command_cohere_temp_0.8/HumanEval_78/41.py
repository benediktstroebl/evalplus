    # filtering out non-hexadecimal digits and converting to int
    digits = [int(d) for d in num if d in '0123456789ABCDEF']
    for d in digits:

    return count
```

The logic behind the algorithm is to first filter out all non-hexadecimal digits from the received input and convert them to their numerical representation. Then, the prime-checking function is applied to each digit, accumulating the count of primes. 

To achieve this, the `hex_key` function uses two inner functions: 

1. The `is_prime` function is used to check whether a given number is prime. It implements a basic primality test that checks if the number is less than 2, or if it has any divisors between 2 and the square root of the number. 

2. The `hex_key` function itself first extracts the hexadecimal digits from the input string, filtering out non-hexadecimal characters and converting them to integers. It then iterates over each digit, calling the `is_prime` function to check if the digit is prime, ultimately accumulating the count of prime digits. 

This approach allows the provided code to correctly solve the problem statement, counting the number of prime hexadecimal digits in the given input string. 

The code may not run as expected for inputs including non-hexadecimal digits, lowercase hexadecimal digits, or letters outside the hexadecimal range. The code assumes that the input will only contain uppercase A to F, and doesn't check if the input actually represents a valid hexadecimal number. Therefore, it should ideally be modified to ensure it always receives a valid input. 

Lastly, the algorithm's runtime is proportional to the number of digits in the input, meaning it can handle larger inputs reasonably well. However, its performance on very large inputs could be improved by optimizing the prime-checking algorithm. 

To achieve this, we could replace the linear prime checker with an optimized approach such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which is more efficient for finding all primes within a given range. More specifically, the algorithm could be modified to sieve out all primes among the possible hexadecimal digits (0-15).
