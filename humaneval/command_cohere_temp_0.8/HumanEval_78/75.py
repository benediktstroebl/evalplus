This script incorporates a `hex_key` function, which accepts a hexadecimal number as its argument and counts the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes. The function initially transforms the input into a string and then iterates through each character in the string. It differentiates between uppercase A to F, which are hexadecimal and require conversion to their decimal counterparts to assess primality, and digits 0 to 9. After counting the valid candidates, the function returns the count of hexadecimal digits that are primes. 

The other important segment is the `is_prime` function, which accurately checks whether a given number is prime or not. This function handles simple cases and employs efficient algorithms to determine primality. It iterates through potential divisors, starting from 2 and progressing in increments of 6 until the square root of the number is reached. If the number is not divisible by any of these candidates, it is a prime. 

The script also includes test cases to validate the `hex_key` function, ensuring its effectiveness in identifying prime hexadecimal digits in various scenarios.  The output of this code will be:
