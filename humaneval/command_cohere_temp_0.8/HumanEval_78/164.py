This script defines a Python function called `hex_key` that solves the problem statement. It takes a hexadecimal number as input and returns the number of hexadecimal digits that are prime numbers. The function uses a list of pre-computed prime numbers and a list of hexadecimal digits to determine the number of prime hexadecimal digits in the input number. The `filter` function is used to iterate through the digits of the input number, and the `len` function returns the count of prime hexadecimal digits.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:
1. `import re`: This line imports the `re` module, which is used to define regular expressions in Python. Regular expressions can be used to match patterns in strings. Although it is not used in this case, it is a general good practice to import this module at the beginning of the script.
2. `primes = ['2', '3', '5', '7', '11', '13', '17', '19', '23', '29', '31', '37', '41', '43', '47', '53', '59', '61', '67', '71', '73', '79', '83', '89', '97']`: This line defines a list named `primes` that contains all the prime numbers from the problem statement. These are the numbers greater than 1 that are not products of two smaller natural numbers, i.e., they have only two factors, 1 and the number itself.
3. `hex_digits = ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']`: This line defines a list named `hex_digits` that contains all the hexadecimal digits. These are the digits used to represent numbers in hexadecimal form, which include the usual decimal digits (`0-9`) along with the additional letters (`A-F`).
4. `prime_hex_digits = [digit for digit in hex_digits if digit in primes]`: This line creates a new list called `prime_hex_digits` by filtering the `hex_digits` list. The `for` loop iterates over each digit in `hex_digits`, and if the digit is also present in the `primes` list (meaning it is a prime number), it adds it to the `prime_hex_digits` list.
5. `return len(list(filter(lambda x: x in prime_hex_digits, num.upper()))))`: Finally, the function returns the length of a list created by filtering the digits in the input `
