```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    """Check is n is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def hex_key(num):
    """Count the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes."""
    digits = '0123456789ABCDEF'
    count = 0
    for digit in num:
        if digit in digits and is_prime(int(digit)):
            count += 1
    return count
```

The approach uses a simple algorithm to check for primality, and then checks each digit in the string and converts it to an integer to check if it is prime. 

#### Complexity Analysis:
**Time Complexity**: `O(k * (log(k) + log(n)))`, where k is the number of digits in the given hexadecimal number, and n is the number being checked for primality. In the worst case, we iterate through all the digits and check each of them for primality. 

**Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as the only additional space used is for iterating through the digits of the number, which can be done using a single variable. No extra arrays or lists are used. 

```python
# TEST YOUR FUNCTION:
print(hex_key("2020")) #2  (contains 2, a prime number)
print(hex_key("AB")) #1  (contains only A)
print(hex_key("1077E")) #2 (contains 3 and 7)
print(hex_key("ABED1A33")) #4 (contains 3, 7, B, and D)
print(hex_key("123456789ABCDEF0")) #6 (contains 2, 3, 5, 7, B, and D)
