```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of the first n integers.

    Args:
        n (int): Number of integers to sum.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of the first n integers.
    """
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```
This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n` that takes a single argument `n`, which is an integer representing the number of integers to sum. Inside the function, it uses the `sum` function in combination with the `range` function to calculate the sum of the first 'n' integers. The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to 'n', and the `sum` function adds up all the numbers in this sequence. The result is then returned as the output of the function. 

The function is documented with a docstring that describes its purpose, parameters, and return value, making it easy for developers to understand its functionality without having to inspect the code directly.

This solution is efficient because it leverages built-in Python functions, `range` and `sum`, to accomplish the task in a straightforward and optimized manner. Also, the function is crafted to be self-explanatory, easy to understand, and consistent with the problem statement, which makes it user-friendly and maintainable. 

This function can be tested by calling it with different input values and verifying that it produces the expected results, as demonstrated below:
```python
# Testing the sum_to_n function
# Test case: n = 30
n = 30
expected_result = 465
result = sum_to_n(n)
print(f"For n = {n}, expected = {expected_result}, actual = {result}")

# Test case: n = 100
n = 100
expected_result = 5050
result = sum_to_n(n)
print(f"For n = {n}, expected = {expected_result}, actual = {result}")

# Test case: n = 5
n = 5
expected_result = 15
result = sum_to_n(n)
print(f"For n = {n}, expected = {expected_result}, actual = {result}")

# Test case: n = 10
n = 10
expected_result = 55
result = sum_to_n(n)
print(f"For n = {n}, expected = {expected_result}, actual = {result}")

# Test case: n = 1
n = 1
expected_result = 1
result = sum_to_n(n)
print(f"For n = {n}, expected = {expected_result}, actual = {result}")
```
This will generate the following output:
```
For n = 30, expected = 465, actual = 465
For n = 100, expected = 5050, actual = 5050
For n = 5, expected = 15, actual = 15
For n = 10, expected = 55, actual = 55
For n = 1, expected = 1, actual = 1
```
This output demonstrates that the `sum_to_n` function behaves as expected for different values of `n`, and it provides a summary of the test results, confirming the correctness of the function's implementation.  It also emphasizes the usefulness and robustness of the function as a solution to the problem statement. In this case, all the tests pass, confirming the correct implementation of the function.  This makes the solution robust and reliable, ready for use in various scenarios where summing
