```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of the first n numbers (1 to n)."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```

This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n` that takes a single argument `n`, which is an integer representing the upper limit of a range of numbers. The function uses the `sum` function to calculate the sum of the numbers in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive), and then returns this computed sum as its output. The docstring explains that the function calculates the sum of the first `n` numbers, where `n` is an integer argument that the function accepts. 

To further verify the correctness of this function, test cases are encouraged to be added to confirm its behavior under different input conditions. Below is a sample of test cases in markdown:
```
```python
# Test Case: Negative N
def test_sum_to_n_negative():
    assert sum_to_n(-3) == -6


# Test Case: Zero Sum
def test_sum_to_n_zero():
    assert sum_to_n(0) == 0


# Test Case: Sum of First Three Numbers
def test_sum_to_n_sum_to_3():
    assert sum_to_n(3) == 3


# Test Case: Large Value of N
def test_sum_to_n_large_n():
    assert sum_to_n(100) == 5050
```
```

These test cases cover different scenarios that the `sum_to_n` function should handle, including handling negative input, ensuring correctness for the sum of numbers up to zero, verifying the sum of the first three numbers, and checking the result for a larger value of `n`. Each test case calls the `sum_to_n` function with a specific input and compares the result against the expected output using the `assert` statement. 

To run these test cases, you can use a specific testing framework, such as `pytest`. These test cases can be stored in a separate file named `test_sum_to_n.py` and then executed using the `pytest` command in the terminal. 

This approach helps to ensure the correctness of the `sum_to_n` function's behavior and guarantees that it adheres to the expected functionality, promptly alerting developers in case of any errors during test execution.  In summary, the test cases cover multiple edge cases and help to validate the correctness of the `sum_to_n` function in different scenarios.  By executing these tests, you can have confidence in the functionality of the `sum_to_n` function.  If you encounter any difficulties in setting up or executing the tests, feel free to inquire.
