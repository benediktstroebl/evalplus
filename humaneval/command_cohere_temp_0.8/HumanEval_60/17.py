```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of integers from 1 to n."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```
This code defines a Python function called sum_to_n, which takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of integers from 1 to n. It utilizes the sum function along with the range function to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to n and then calculates their sum. The purpose of the function is to provide a convenient way to calculate the sum of numbers within a specified range, making it useful for various numeric computations where summation is required.
