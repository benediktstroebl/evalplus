```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of integers from 1 to n."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```
This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n`. This function takes a single argument, `n`, which is an integer. The purpose of this function is to calculate and return the sum of all integers from 1 to 'n'. It achieves this by using the `sum` function and passing a `range` object to it. The `range` object generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to (and including) 'n'. Finally, the sum of this sequence is calculated and returned as the result of the function. 

The docstring explains the purpose of the function and provides example usage scenarios. These scenarios demonstrate how to call the function with different values of 'n' and show the corresponding output.
