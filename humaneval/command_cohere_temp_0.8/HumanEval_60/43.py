```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of the first n numbers (starting from 1)."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```

This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n` that takes a single argument, `n`, which is an integer representing the upper limit of a series of numbers. The function allocates an integer list ranging from 1 to n inclusive using the `range` function. It then calculates the sum of these numbers using the `sum` function and returns the result. 

The code includes a docstring with documentation for the `sum_to_n` function, providing a clear explanation of its purpose, input, and output. Furthermore, the docstring includes informative examples that demonstrate how the function behaves for various inputs. These examples allow readers to understand how to use the function and what to expect from its output.
