```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of the first n integers.

    Args:
        n (int): Number of integers to sum.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of the first n integers.
    """
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```
This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n` that takes a single argument `n`, which is an integer representing the number of integers to sum. Inside the function, it uses the `sum` function in combination with the `range` function to calculate the sum of the first 'n' integers. The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to 'n', and the `sum` function adds up all the values in this sequence. The result is then returned as the output of the function. 

The function includes a docstring to describe its purpose, input, and output for the benefit of developers who may use or read this code in the future.

The code is self-contained and does not rely on any external variables or context, making it easy to reuse in different environments.  It can be executed directly in a Python environment or imported as a module if needed.  It's also compatible with a variety of Python versions due to its simplicity and minimal dependencies. 

This function could be used in various scenarios, including calculating sums for specific ranges in applications, analyzing data where the sum of consecutive numbers is needed, or in educational settings to demonstrate the sum of intervals concept.  Additionally, it could be further enhanced with additional tests to ensure its correctness, covering edge cases and various 'n' values to ensure it behaves as expected.  Finally, efforts could be made to optimize the function's implementation if performance becomes a concern due to the scalability of 'n'.  This could involve leveraging Python's array capabilities or other more efficient mathematical strategies.
