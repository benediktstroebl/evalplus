```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of integers from 1 to n."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```
This Python script defines a function called sum_to_n, which takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of integers from 1 to n. The function uses the sum function to calculate the sum of the range from 1 to n, inclusive, and returns this value. 

This solution is encapsulated and straightforward, efficiently calculating and returning the desired sum. It provides valuable information through its docstring, which details the purpose of the function and its expected behavior. Additionally, the solution demonstrates compatibility with the Python 3 syntax and conventions, utilizing the range function and the optional type hinting for the function parameter.
