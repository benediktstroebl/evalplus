```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of integers from 1 to n."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```

This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of integers from 1 to `n`. It uses the `sum` function to calculate the sum of the range of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and returns the result. The function's description informs users that it computes the sum of numbers from 1 to a given value `n`. 

The docstring also includes illustrative test cases that demonstrate the behavior of the function when different values of `n` are passed. These test cases help illustrate how the function computes the sum for different ranges and demonstrate the functionality of the `sum_to_n` function.
