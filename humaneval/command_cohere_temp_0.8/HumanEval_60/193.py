```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of the first n numbers (1 through n)."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```

This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n` that takes a single argument, `n`, which is an integer representing the upper limit of a range of numbers. The function leverages the `range()` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, and then uses the `sum()` function to add up all the numbers in this sequence, providing the total sum of the first `n` numbers. 

The function includes a docstring that provides a concise description of its purpose and behavior, offering clarity to users who may consult the documentation. 

This script ensures functionality and effectiveness in solving the problem, as well as comprehensibility to users who may peruse the code.
