```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of integers from 1 to n."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```

This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n`. This function takes a single argument, `n`, which is an integer. The purpose of this function is to calculate and return the sum of all integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). It uses the `sum` function to add up all the values in the `range` of numbers from 1 to `n`, including both 1 and `n`. 

To ensure the function is easily tested, the comment above the function includes a doctest. This a string that contains example inputs and expected outputs. Python compares these expected outputs with the actual outputs produced by the function when the example inputs are provided. If the actual and expected match, the test passes. The doctest for this function is `>>> sum_to_n(30) == 465`, indicating that when the function is called as `sum_to_n(30)`, it is expected to return the value `465`. 

Overall, this code provides a succinct and accurate solution to the problem, while also being easily testable. 

```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of integers from 1 to n."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
