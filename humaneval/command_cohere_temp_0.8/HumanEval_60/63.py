```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of integers from 1 to n."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```

This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n` that takes a single argument `n`, which is an integer representing the upper limit of a range of numbers. The function uses the `sum` function to calculate the sum of integers in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`, and the `sum` function adds up all the values in this sequence, providing the total sum of the first 'n' positive integers. 

The function then returns this computed sum as its result. This allows you to easily calculate the sum of any range of numbers between 1 and a given value 'n' by simply calling the sum_to_n function with that specific value for 'n'.  It efficiently computes the sum of this range with a concise one-line code snippet. 

The function includes a docstring in the form of a triple-quoted string that provides an informative summary of its purpose, specifying it calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 'n'. This docstring explains the function's behavior and how to use it effectively, making the code more understandable and self-documenting. 

This approach ensures the function has a clear and helpful built-in explanation for anyone who later reads or uses the code. 





```python
# Test the function with a specific input to verify if it returns the expected output
n = 5
expected_sum = sum(range(1, 6))  # Manual sum of the range to compare
assert sum_to_n(n) == expected_sum  # Verify the function's behavior
```

This code includes a test case where a specific value of 'n' (n=5) is selected, and the function is asked to process this particular input and return the sum of the range from 1 to n. The test uses an alternative approach to calculate the expected sum manually using the `range` function, confirming that the function behaves as expected. 

The `assert` statement checks whether the output of the `sum_to_n` function is equal to the manually computed expected sum, successfully validating the function's correctness if the test passes without any errors.  This type of automated testing ensures the function continues to provide expected results regardless of any code changes or environmental conditions, promoting reliable and consistent behavior.
