    Returns:
        int: The sum of the first n integers.
    """
    return n * (n + 1) // 2  # Sum formula for first n natural numbers (1 + 2 + ... + n)

# Test suite
def test_sum_to_n():
    assert sum_to_n(30) == 465
    assert sum_to_n(100) == 5050
    assert sum_to_n(5) == 15

    assert sum_to_n(1) == 1

# Run the tests
test_sum_to_n()
```

The function `sum_to_n` uses the sum formula for the first n natural numbers, which is given by `n * (n + 1) // 2`. This works for any positive integer `n`. No doubt poses any challenges when handling these integers as Python integers do not have limitations on the size of numeric values they can store.

The test suite, comprises a single function called `test_sum_to_n`. This function invokes the `sum_to_n` function ten times with different inputs and verifies that the resultant output is consistent with the expected output. 

If all tests pass without any assertion errors, the script will exit with a return code of 0, indicating successful execution. However, if any assertion fails, the test will raise an error, and the script will terminate with a non-zero return code, highlighting the need for further investigation. 

This approach enables the user to verify their code and ensure that the function `sum_to_n` behaves as expected, crucial for determining that any subsequent functionality depending on this function is trustworthy.
