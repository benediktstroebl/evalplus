```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of integers from 1 to n."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```
This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n`. This function takes a single argument, `n`, which is an integer. The purpose of this function is to calculate and return the sum of all integers from 1 to 'n'. It achieves this by using the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 'n', and then applies the `sum` function to add up all the numbers in this sequence. 

The function is encapsulated in a docstring that provides a meaningful description of its purpose, and includes test cases to demonstrate its behavior for various input values.
