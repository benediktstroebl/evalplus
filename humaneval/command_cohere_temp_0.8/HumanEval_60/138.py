```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of the first n numbers."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```

This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n`. This function takes a single argument, `n`, which is an integer. The purpose of this function is to calculate and return the sum of the first 'n' numbers. In Python, a sequence of numbers can be generated using the `range()` function, and their sum can be calculated using the `sum()` function. This is achieved by invoking `range(1, n + 1)` to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 'n', and then using `sum()` to add up these numbers. 

The function summary is provided in the docstring, which explains that the function computes the sum of numbers from 1 to 'n'. This clarifies the purpose and usage of the function for users who may want to understand or use the function in the future.

This code demonstrates fundamental Python concepts related to functions, integers, and built-in functions like `sum()` and `range()`. It also exhibits Python's readability and elegance in expressing problems through functions and concise variable names. Furthermore, the function showcases Python's philosophy of utilizing functions with descriptive docstrings to make code more readable and maintainable.
