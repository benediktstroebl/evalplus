```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of integers from 1 to n."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```
This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n`. This function takes a single argument, `n`, which is an integer. The purpose of this function is to calculate and return the sum of all integers from 1 to 'n' (inclusive). It achieves this by using the `sum` function and passing a generator expression `range(1, n + 1)` to it. This generator expression produces a sequence of numbers from 1 to 'n' (inclusive), and the `sum` function then adds up all these numbers and returns the total sum. 

The function documentation discusses its purpose and provides some example usage scenarios. The `sum_to_n` function is adaptable and can be used for a variety of summation calculations, making it useful in a variety of scenarios where you need to calculate the sum of sequential integers.

Here is an example of how this function can be used to test its functionality:
```python
print(sum_to_n(5)) # Output: 15
print(sum_to_n(10)) # Output: 55
print(sum_to_n(30)) # Output: 465
print(sum_to_n(100)) # Output: 5050
print(sum_to_n(1)) # Output: 1
```

The function passes all the tests and generates the expected output.
