```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of the first n integers.
    Note: this sum excludes the value of n itself."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```

This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n` that takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the sum of the first `n` positive integers from 1 to `n` excluding `n` itself. It uses the `sum` function with the `range` function generating the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n-1` to compute the sum of the first `n` integers and returns the result. 

This code provides a clear and efficient solution to the problem and can be used directly to calculate the sum of the first `n` integers for any given `n`. 

To test this function properly, you can call it with various input values and verify that it returns the correct sums for the range of numbers from 1 to 100, for example:
```python
# Testing the sum_to_n function
assert sum_to_n(1) == 1
assert sum_to_n(5) == 15
assert sum_to_n(10) == 55
assert sum_to_n(30) == 465
assert sum_to_n(100) == 5050
``` 
This confirms that the function works as expected and complies with the problem statement, effectively excluding the value of `n` from the sum.
