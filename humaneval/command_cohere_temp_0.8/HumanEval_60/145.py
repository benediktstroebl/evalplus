This script defines a function `sum_to_n`, which calculates the sum of the first `n` integers using the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. The function is then tested with different input values, ensuring that it produces the expected outputs based on the formula. The `print` statements demonstrate the correctness of the function for different input values.
