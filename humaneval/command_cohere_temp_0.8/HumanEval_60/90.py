```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of integers from 1 to n."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```

This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of integers from 1 to `n`. It uses the `sum` function to calculate the sum of the range of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and returns the result. The title and documentation string of the function provide information about its purpose and usage, emphasizing that it calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to `n`. It serves as a straightforward utility function to perform summations over a specified range. 

You can call this function by providing an integer argument to see the sum of integers from 1 to `n`. For example:
```python
sum_to_n(5)  # Output: 15
```
