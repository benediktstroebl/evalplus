```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of the first n integers.

    Args:
        n (int): Number of integers to sum.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of the first n integers.
    """
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```
This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n` that takes a single argument `n`, which is an integer representing the number of integers to sum. Inside the function, it uses the `sum` function in combination with the `range` function to calculate the sum of the first `n` integers. The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`, and the `sum` function adds up all the numbers in this sequence, providing a total sum as the result. The function effectively calculates and returns the sum of the first `n` integers, where `n` is an input parameter. 

The function includes a docstring comment that describes its purpose, input, and output, providing clarity for users who may want to understand or utilize the function in their code.

This improved version offers a concise and functional way to calculate the sum of integers within the given range.
