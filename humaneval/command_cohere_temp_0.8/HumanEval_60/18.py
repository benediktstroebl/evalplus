```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of the first n numbers."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```
This code defines a Python function called sum_to_n, which takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of the first n numbers. The function uses the range function to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) and then calls the sum function to add up all the numbers in that sequence. 

The summary line in the markdown code block can be added to provide some test cases to ensure the correct behavior of the function. In this case, it includes a few test cases that demonstrate the behavior of the sum_to_n function for different values of n.
