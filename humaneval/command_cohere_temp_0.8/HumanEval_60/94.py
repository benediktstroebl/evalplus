```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of integers from 1 to n."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```

This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n` that takes a single argument `n`, which is an integer. Inside the function, it uses the `sum` function combined with the `range` function to calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`, and the `sum` function adds up all the values in this sequence, providing the total sum of integers from 1 to `n`. 

The function then returns this computed sum as its output. The function includes a docstring (`RETURN VALUE`) that describes its purpose, providing clarity for users who may want to understand or utilize the function in the future.

This improved version enhances readability and maintains a straightforward explanation of the code functionality. Let me know if you would like further refinements or if there's another piece of coding you'd like assistance with!
