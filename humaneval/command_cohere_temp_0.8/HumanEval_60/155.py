```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of integers from 1 to n."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```
This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n`. This function takes a single argument, `n`, which is an integer. The purpose of this function is to calculate and return the sum of all integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). It achieves this by using the `sum` function and `range` function in combination. The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers up to, but not including, `n`, and the `sum` function adds up all the elements in this sequence, effectively computing the desired sum. 

The function returns the calculated sum of all integers from 1 to `n`, providing a straightforward way to obtain the total of this consecutive sequence of numbers.
