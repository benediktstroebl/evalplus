```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of integers from 1 to n."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```
This code defines a Python function called sum_to_n, which takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of integers from 1 to n. It uses the sum function to calculate the sum of the range of integers from 1 to n, inclusive, and returns the result. The function's description explains its purpose and provides example usage, allowing users to understand how to use it and what result to expect when they call it with different values of n.
