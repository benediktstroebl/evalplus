```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of integers from 1 to n."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```
This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n`. This function takes a single argument, `n`, which is an integer. The purpose of this function is to calculate and return the sum of all integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). It achieves this by using the `sum` function in combination with `range`, which generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, and then adds up all the values in that sequence. 

The function is encapsulated in a docstring that provides a meaningful description of its purpose and behavior, giving an understanding of what the function does without needing to examine the underlying code.
