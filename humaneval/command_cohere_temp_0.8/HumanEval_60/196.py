```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of integers from 1 to n."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```

This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n`. This function takes a single argument, `n`, which is an integer. The function calculates and returns the sum of integers from 1 to `n` using the `sum` function and the `range` function with a step of 1. It essentially adds up all the numbers between 1 and `n` (inclusive) to provide the total sum. 

The docstring explains that the function calculates the sum of integers from 1 to 'n', and provides example usage in the docstring to illustrate how to use the function correctly.
