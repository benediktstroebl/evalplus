```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of integers from 1 to n."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```

This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of integers from 1 to `n`. It uses the `sum` function to calculate the sum of the range of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and returns the result. The function's description explains that it computes the sum of numbers between 1 and the input value `n`. This purpose is clarified with a docstring. The example usage demonstrates the behavior of the function for different input values (`n`) and shows the correct operation of the function. In summary, the code presents a well-documented function that clearly defines its purpose and provides illustrative usage examples.
