```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of integers from 1 to n."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```
This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n`. This function takes a single argument, `n`, which is an integer. The purpose of this function is to calculate and return the sum of all integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). It uses the `sum` function to add up all the values in the `range` of numbers from 1 to `n`, and the result is then returned as the output of the function. 

This function is typically used when you have a specific number `n`, and you want to find the total sum of the first 'n' positive integers. 

For example, calling this function with `n = 5` will return a sum of 15, as it adds up the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Calling it with `n = 10` will return 55, and so on. The function is well-documented with a comments section that explains its purpose, input, and usage.  This makes it easy for developers to quickly understand what the function does and how to use it correctly.
