```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of integers from 1 to n."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```
This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n`. This function takes a single argument, `n`, which is an integer. The purpose of this function is to calculate and return the sum of all integers from 1 to 'n'. It achieves this by using the `sum` function and passing a `range` object to it. In Python, the `range` function creates a sequence of numbers starting from the starting value (inclusive) and ending at the ending value (exclusive). So, when we call `range(1, n + 1)`, it generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 'n' (exclusive), and the `sum` function then adds up all these numbers, providing the desired result. 

The function is documented with a comment indicating its purpose, and it includes a series of docstrings that describe its behavior and provide examples of how it can be used. These docstrings follow the Sphinx syntax, which is a widely used convention for generating clean and readable documentation in Python projects.

Overall, this code segment provides a useful and well-documented function for calculating the sum of integers between 1 and a given number 'n'.
