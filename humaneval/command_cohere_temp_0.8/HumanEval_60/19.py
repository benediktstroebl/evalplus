```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of integers from 1 to n."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```
This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n`. This function takes a single argument, `n`, which is an integer. The purpose of this function is to calculate and return the sum of all integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). It uses the `sum` function to add up the values of the `range` of numbers from 1 to `n`, which produces the desired sum. 

The script includes a comment that describes the purpose of the function, as well as some test cases in a Markdown cell to demonstrate its behavior. These test cases are designed to show how the function works for different values of `n`.

In summary, this code provides a precise and efficient way to calculate the sum of integers between 1 and a given number `n` using the `sum_to_n` function.
