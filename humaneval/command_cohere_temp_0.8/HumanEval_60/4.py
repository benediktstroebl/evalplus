```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of the first n numbers (1 to n)."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```

This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n` that takes a single argument `n`, which is an integer representing the upper limit of a range from which the function computes a sum of numbers. The function employs the `sum` function to calculate the sum of values within the range defined by `range(1, n+1)`, which includes numbers from 1 to `n`. This behavior is illustrated in the function's docstring, which provides examples that show the predicted sum for different values of `n`. Notably, the function includes a descriptive docstring that explains its purpose and provides usage examples, effectively communicating its functionality to potential users.
