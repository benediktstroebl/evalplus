```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of integers from 1 to n."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```

This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of integers from 1 to `n`. It uses the `sum` function to calculate the sum of the range of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and returns the result. The title and documentation strings within the function provide information about the purpose and usage of the function, indicating that it calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 'n' and showing example calls to the function with different values of 'n'. 

This function can be used to efficiently calculate the sum of a range of numbers, which is a common task in various domains, such as accounting, finance, and analytics.

This code is self-contained, meaning that it does not depend on any external libraries or modules, and it can be run as-is to achieve the desired result.  It can be executed directly in a Python environment or integrated into larger Python programs or applications to calculate the sum of numbers within a specific range.
