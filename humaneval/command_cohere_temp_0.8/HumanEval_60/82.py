```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of the first n numbers (starting from 1)."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```

This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of the first `n` numbers starting from 1. It uses the `sum` function to calculate the sum of the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and returns the result. 

This solution should help provide a straightforward way to calculate the sum of numbers up to a given limit `n`. 

You can use this function in other parts of your program by calling it with different values of `n` to calculate the sum of the first `n` numbers for different values.
