```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of integers from 1 to n."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```

This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n` that takes a single argument `n`, which is an integer representing the upper limit of a range of numbers. The function uses the `sum` function to calculate the sum of integers in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`, and the `sum` function adds up all the values in this sequence, providing the total sum of the integers from 1 to `n` as the result. 

This function is encapsulated in a Python script, making it a self-contained solution to the problem. When executed, this script will output the sum of integers from 1 to `n` without relying on any external variables or dependencies.
