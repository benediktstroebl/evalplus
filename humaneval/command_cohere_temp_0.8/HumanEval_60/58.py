```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of integers from 1 to n."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```

This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of integers from 1 to `n`. It uses the `sum` function to calculate the sum of the range of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and returns the result. 

This solution should help provide an efficient and concise way to calculate the sum of integers in a given range, which is a common task in various computational scenarios. 

You can use this function in other parts of your code by calling it with different values of `n` to calculate the sum of integers to n for various scenarios.
