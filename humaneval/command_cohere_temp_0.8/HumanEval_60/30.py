This Python script defines a function `sum_to_n` that calculates the sum of numbers between 1 and a given number `n`. It uses the `sum` function to add up the values in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). 

The function's description, argument, and return value are also mentioned in the documentation. To utilize this function, simply provide an integer as a parameter, and it will return the total of the first 'n' integers.
