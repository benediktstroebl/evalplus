```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of integers from 1 to n."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```
This Python script defines a function called sum_to_n, which takes an input n, representing the upper limit of a range of numbers. The function utilizes the sum function to calculate the sum of integers ranging from 1 to n. This is achieved by using the range function to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to n, including both endpoints, and passing this sequence to the sum function for addition. The result is the total sum of all the numbers within the specified range, representing the cumulative value of adding consecutive integers from 1 to n.
