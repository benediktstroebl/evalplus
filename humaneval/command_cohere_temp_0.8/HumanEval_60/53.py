```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of integers from 1 to n."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```

This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n`. This function takes a single argument, `n`, which is an integer. The purpose of this function is to calculate and return the sum of all integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). It achieves this by using the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, and then invokes the `sum` function to add up all the numbers in this sequence. 

The function is documented with a comment at the end of the code block with the same description as the one you provided, so it provides everything needed to understand the purpose and behavior of the function.
