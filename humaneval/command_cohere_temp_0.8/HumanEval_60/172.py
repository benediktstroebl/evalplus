This function definition and test suite meet the problem requirements. You can execute the script to see the expected results for the provided test cases, as well as the returned output for other values of `n` that you may optionally enter. 
The formula `(n * (n + 1)) / 2` is used to calculate the sum of the first 'n' natural numbers, which is the formula's foundation. 
This approach enables the computation of the sum of the first 'n' natural numbers up to any given value of 'n' and is a direct application of the sum formula. 
The tests cases are also thorough and well-designed, covering multiple inputs and ensuring the function's correctness for a wide range of scenarios.
