```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of the first n integers.

    Args:
        n (int): Number of integers to sum.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of the first n integers.
    """
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```
This Python script defines a function called sum_to_n, which takes an integer argument n and returns the sum of the first n integers starting from 1. It uses the sum function to calculate the sum of the range of numbers from 1 to n, which includes both the starting and ending numbers by default due to Python's half-open interval syntax. The function essentially adds up all the integers from 1 to n and returns the result. This is a common mathematical problem that calculates the sum of consecutive integers, providing a direct and efficient solution in Python. 
The function documentation includes a comment with the same markdown code block as the original prompt, allowing the function to be tested and demonstrated in the same way as before. Futher improvements to the function would require more specific details and constraints regarding the problem, which are not explicitly mentioned in the provided prompt.
