```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    """Returns the sum of integers from 1 to n."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```

This code defines a Python function called `sum_to_n` that takes a single argument `n`, which is an integer representing the upper limit of a range of numbers. The function uses the `sum` function to calculate the sum of integers in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, and the `sum` function adds up all the values in this sequence, providing the total sum as the result. 

The function then returns this total sum as its output. The result is a single integer representing the sum of all the integers from 1 to 'n'. 

This code is self-contained, meaning it can be run as is, and it independently performs the function's task without relying on external variables or functions.
