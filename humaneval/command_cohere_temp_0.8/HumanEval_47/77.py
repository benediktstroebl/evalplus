```python
def median(l: list):
    """Return median of elements in the list l."""
    # Check if the list is empty
    if len(l) == 0:
        return None
    # Check if the list has only one element
    if len(l) == 1:
        return l[0]
    # Sort the list
    sorted_list = sorted(l)
    # Finds the median in the sorted list
    # median is the middle value of the list if it has an odd number of elements
    if len(sorted_list) % 2 == 1:
        return sorted_list[len(sorted_list) // 2]
    # If the number of elements in the list is even, the median is the average of the two middle values
    middle_index1, middle_index2 = len(sorted_list) // 2, (len(sorted_list) // 2) - 1
    return (sorted_list[middle_index1] + sorted_list[middle_index2]) / 2
```
The function checks if the list is empty or has only one element, returns None or the only element accordingly. For a list with multiple elements, it sorts the list and then determines the median depending on whether the list has an odd or even number of elements. The markdown docstring is also added to provide an explanation for the code and its behavior. 
```python
def median(l: list):
    """Return median of elements in the list l.
    >>> median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
    3
    >>> median([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20])
    15.0
    """
``` 
This code defines the `median` function that calculates the median of the values in the input list `l`. The function first checks if the list is empty or has only one element, returning `None` or the single value respectively. If the list has more than one element, it sorts the list in ascending order. For an odd number of elements, the median is the middle value. For an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle values. The docstring includes example tests showcasing the correct behavior of the median function. Note that this function assumes that the list contains only numeric values that support sorting and averaging. Non-numeric elements would cause a `TypeError`. 
If the list contains negative and positive numbers, the averaging in the case of an even number of elements may result in a fraction less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0. To avoid this, the code can be modified to round the average to the nearest integer. 
Let's adjust the code accordingly: 

```python
def median(l: list):
    """Return median of elements in the list l."""
    # Check if the list is empty
    if len(l) == 0:
        return None
    # Check if the list has only one element
    if len(l) == 1:
        return l[0]
    # Sort the list
    sorted_list = sorted(l)
    # Finds the median in the sorted list
    # median is the middle value of the list if it has an odd number of elements
    if len(sorted_list) % 2 == 1:
        return sorted_list[len(sorted_list) // 2]
    # If the number of elements in the list is even, the median is the average of the two middle values
    middle_index1, middle_index2 = len(sorted_list) // 2, (len(sorted_list) // 2) - 1
    # Round the average to the nearest integer
    return round((sorted_
