```python
def median(l: list):
    """Return median of elements in the list l."""
    # Check if the list is empty
    if len(l) == 0:
        return None
    # Check if the list has only one element
    if len(l) == 1:
        return l[0]
    # Sort the list
    sorted_l = sorted(l)
    # Find the middle index
    middle_index = len(sorted_l) // 2
    # Check if the list has an odd number of elements
    if len(sorted_l) % 2 != 0:
        return sorted_l[middle_index]
    # If the list has an even number of elements, return the average of the two middle elements
    middle_left = sorted_l[middle_index - 1]
    middle_right = sorted_l[middle_index]
    return (middle_left + middle_right) / 2
```

This function handles cases of empty lists, lists with one element, and odd and even length lists. It sorts the list first to have a guaranteed order for computation of the median, which is computed through the use of boolean logic and index selection, or averaging for even length lists. This methodology allows for the efficient computation of the median value in a list, and is robust for various input lengths and value types.
