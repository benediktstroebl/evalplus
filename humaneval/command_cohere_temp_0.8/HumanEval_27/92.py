```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(char.swapcase() for char in string)
```
This script defines a function `flip_case` that takes a string as an argument and flips the case of each character. The `join` method is used to combine the flipped characters back into a string. 

To test this function, you can use the following Python code:
```python
tested = ' Tested': 'TcENED'
print(tested)
assert flip_case(tested) == 'TcENED'
```

This code demonstrates how the `flip_case` function can be used to flip the case of a given input string. The output of this code is:
```python
TcENED
``` 
And the `assert` statement successfully validates the correctness of the `flip_case` function.
