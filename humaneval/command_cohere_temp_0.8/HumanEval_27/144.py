```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    """
    Flip case of characters in a string. Turn uppercase characters to lowercase and vice versa.
    """
    return string.swapcase()
```
This function utilizes the `swapcase` method, which directly converts uppercase characters in the string to lowercase and vice versa. The `swapcase` method is a built-in Python function that works seamlessly for a wide range of inputs. Hence, it simplifies the code while maintaining readability and efficiency.
