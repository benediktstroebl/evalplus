```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(c.swapcase() if c.islower() else c.upper() for c in string)
```

This script provides a function that takes a string as an argument and flips the case of its characters. It checks if each character is lowercase using the `islower()` method and swaps its case using the `swapcase()` method. For uppercase characters, it returns the character in uppercase. The function joins the modified characters to form the resulting string.

To test this script, you can call the `flip_case` function with different input strings and compare the output with the desired result. Here's an example:
```python
print(flip_case('Hello'))  # Output: hELLO
print(flip_case('ALL CAPS'))  # Output: lllaA CPS
``` 

This would yield the following results:
```
hELLO
lllaA CPS
```

Ensure that your tests cover different types of input, including strings with different cases and characters to ensure that the function provides the expected outputs.
