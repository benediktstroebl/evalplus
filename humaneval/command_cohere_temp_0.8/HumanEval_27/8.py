```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(c.swapcase() if c.isalpha() else c for c in string)
```

This code uses the swapcase function to flip the case of alphabetic characters, and leaves non-alphabetic characters unchanged. The result is then joined back into a string using a concatenation operator. The logic behind this code assumes that the string contains at least one character that can be flipped, but it doesn't explicitly verify that assumption, so in isolation, it wouldn't be incorrect to say that this code assumes the input is a string of at least one character. 

To ensure that the input is indeed a string of at least one character, I can add a docstring with a usage example and tests with good and bad inputs to verify the function's behavior:
```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    """
    Flip the case of alphabetic characters in a string, while leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged.
    
    :param string: the input string
    :return: the processed string
    """
    return ''.join(c.swapcase() if c.isalpha() else c for c in string)

def test_flip_case():
    """
    Test the flip_case function.
    """
    assert flip_case("Hello World") == "hELLO WORLD"
    assert flip_case("FOO BAR baz bAz") == "FOO bar BAZ bAz"
    assert flip_case("αβγ Δθε λμν ξψω ΑΒΓ ΔΘΕ λΜΝ ΞΨΩ") == "αβγ Δθε λμν ξψω ΑΒΓ ΔΘΕ λΜΝ ΞΨΩ"
    assert flip_case("123 abc $@^*()_+=-[]{}|;.:<>?") == "123 abc $@^*()_+=-[]{}|;.:<>?"
    assert flip_case("") == ""
```
