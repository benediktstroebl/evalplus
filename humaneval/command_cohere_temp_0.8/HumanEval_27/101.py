```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(c.swapcase() if c.islower() else c for c in string)
```

This script provides a function that takes a string as an input and returns a string with flipped case, ensuring that the change is consistent with the problem description. To execute the function, simply call `flip_case` and pass the desired string as an argument, as demonstrated in the provided example. The expected output for the example input 'Hello' is 'hELLO'.
