```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(c.swapcase() if c.isalpha() else c for c in string)
```

This script defines a function that flips the case of alphabetic characters in a string, converting uppercase characters to lowercase and vice versa. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each character in the input string. For alpha characters, it calls `swapcase()` to change the case, and for non-alpha characters (e.g., punctuation), it remains unchanged. The final string is then returned as the result. 

The example usage and test case provided in the problem statement can be added to adequately test this function. 

For example:
```python
def test_flip_case():
    assert flip_case("Hello World") == "hELLO WORLD"
    assert flip_case("aBrAcaDabRa") == "aBCAd bRaACd"
    assert flip_case("123$%^&*()") == "123$%^&*()"
```

This way, you can ensure the function accurately performs the character flipping while retaining non-alphabetic characters intact.
