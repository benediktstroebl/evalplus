```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(char.swapcase() for char in string)
```
The function utilizes the `swapcase` method to effectively flip the case of each character in the string. This method simplifies the flip-case transformation by internally managing the conversion of uppercase characters to lowercase and vice versa.

To employ the `flip_case` function, merely invoke it with a string as an argument, and the transformed string will be returned. As exemplified in the given test case, utilizing the function with the input string "Hello" successfully yields the result "hELLO".

Here's the full code for a clearer representation:
```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(char.swapcase() for char in string)

# Test the function
input_string = "Hello"
result = flip_case(input_string)
print(f"'{input_string}' flipped case: '{result}'")
```
This code snippet can be executed directly or integrated into a larger program. The `flip_case` function is encapsulated and standalone, allowing its seamless inclusion in diverse projects to simply flip the case of characters within strings.
