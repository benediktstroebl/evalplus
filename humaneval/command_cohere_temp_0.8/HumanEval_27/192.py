```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(char.swapcase() if char.islower() else char.upper() for char in string)
```

This code uses a list comprehension with a conditional to determine whether each character of the input string is in lowercase or uppercase, and then flips the case accordingly, leaving uppercase characters unchanged, and flipping lowercase characters to uppercase.

To test this, you can run the following input and expected output pairs to verify the function:
```python
>>> flip_case('hello World!')
'HELLO World!'
>>> flip_case('CamelCase')
'cAMELcASE'
>>> flip_case('AAA_BBB')
'AAA_BBB'
``` 

Note that the input string "AAA_BBB" is left unchanged because it contains neither lowercase nor uppercase characters. The space and punctuation are also left unchanged by this function.
