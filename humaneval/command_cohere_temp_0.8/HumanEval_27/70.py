```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    """
    Flip case of characters in a string. Shifts uppercase characters to lowercase and vice versa.
    """
    return ''.join(char.swapcase() for char in string)
```
This script defines a function 'flip_case', which takes a string as an input and returns a string with the case of characters flipped. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string, using the swapcase function to flip the case of each character. The resulting characters are then joined together to form the output string. 
The docstring at the beginning of the script explains the functionality and usage of the 'flip_case' function. This helps provide clarity and useful information for developers who may want to use or understand the function's purpose. It also outlines the input type and returns the output type as a string. 
The function is designed to be case-sensitive, meaning it considers uppercase characters to be different from lowercase characters. Thus, flipping the case will result in distinct character variations rather than simply flipping a subset of characters. 
You can use this function by calling it and passing a string as an argument to see the result of flipping the case of each character. Flipping the case of characters can be useful in various scenarios, such as generating alternative text representations, creating masked versions of strings, or transforming text for specific effects. 
If you want to test this function and check its behavior, consider using test cases that cover different types of characters, such as uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters, to ensure that they are flipped correctly.
