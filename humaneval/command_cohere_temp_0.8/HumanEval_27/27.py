```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(c.swapcase() if c.isalpha() else c for c in string)
```

This script provides a function that accepts a string as an argument and returns a new string with flipped cases for alphabetical characters. The `join` method is utilized to amalgamate the modified characters into a single string.

To verify the functionality, you can run the test case provided earlier, or alternatively, use the following code:
```python
test_case = 'Hello World, Json Vs Csv'
expected_result = 'hELLO WORLD, jsON Vs CSV'

assert flip_case(test_case) == expected_result
```

This will provide confidence that the function operates correctly.
