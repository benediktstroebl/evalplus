```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(char.swapcase() for char in string)
```
The function directly applies the `swapcase()` method to each character in the string, which eliminates the need for an explicit list comprehension and makes the code more concise and readable. This solution maintains the same functionality as the provided solution and produces the correct result for the test case.

To test this function, you can run the following code:
```python
test_str = 'Hello, World!'
expected_result = 'hELLO, wORLD!'

result = flip_case(test_str)

assert result == expected_result
```

This test case ensures that the function 'flip_case' behaves as expected, and the result is verified with the 'assert' statement.

To run the test, you can save the functions and the test code in a Python file (e.g., `flip_case_test.py`) and execute the file in your Python environment.

The `assert` statement verifies that the actual result of `flip_case(test_str)` matches the expected result, and running the script will ensure that the test passes, confirming the correct behavior of the `flip_case` function.
