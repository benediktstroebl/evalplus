```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(c.swapcase() if c.islower() else c.upper() for c in string)
```

This script defines a function `flip_case` that takes a string as an input and toggles the case of each character. If the character is in lowercase, it is converted to uppercase, and vice versa. This is achieved using a generator expression and the `join()` method to convert the iterable of transformed characters back into a string.

To test this function, you can run the following code:
```python
test_str = "hello WORLD!"

assert flip_case(test_str) == "hELLO WORLD!"
```

This verifies that the `flip_case` function effectively flips the case of the input string. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions or if you'd like further assistance.
