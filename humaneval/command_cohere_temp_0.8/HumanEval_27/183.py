```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    """
    Flip lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase characters to lowercase in a string.
    :param string: String to transform.
    :return: The transformed string.
    """
    # Use a list comprehension to split string into list of characters and then swap case for each character.
    return ''.join(char.swapcase() for char in string)
```

This code defines a function called `flip_case` that takes a string as an input. This function uses a list comprehension to split the input string into individual characters. Then, a swapcase function is applied to each character to swap the case. Finally, the rejoined string is returned as the output. 

The `swapcase` function is a built-in Python function that takes a character as a parameter and swaps its case, converting uppercase characters to lowercase and vice versa. 

This solution is self-contained, easily understandable, and efficient in solving the problem statement. It also does not bring in any external dependencies that may cause maintenance issues in the long run.
