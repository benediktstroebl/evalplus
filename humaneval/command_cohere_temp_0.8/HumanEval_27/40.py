```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(c.swapcase() if c.isalpha() else c for c in string)
```

This script provides a function that takes a string as an input and returns a string with flipped cases for every alphabetic character, whereas numeric and special characters remain unchanged. The `swapcase` method is used for flipping cases. The `join` method is then used to concatenate the modified characters back together. 

Would you like to know more about the `swapcase` method or any other topic? Feel free to ask and explore further!
