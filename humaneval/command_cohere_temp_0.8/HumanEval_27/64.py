```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(c.swapcase() if c.isalpha() else c for c in string)
```

This script provides a function that accepts a string as an argument and returns a new string where all lowercase characters are flipped to uppercase and all uppercase characters are flipped to lowercase. The `join()` method is used to combine the modified characters back into a single string. This ensures that only alphabetic characters are altered while non-alphabetic characters are left unchanged.

The code includes a test case in the function to demonstrate how the function works. By calling `flip_case('Hello')`, the result `hELLO` is returned, showcasing the transformation of the input string.

This solution is efficient and straightforward, providing a clear implementation of the problem description. It avoids unnecessary complexity and maintains code readability.
