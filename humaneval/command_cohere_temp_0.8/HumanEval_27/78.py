```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(c.swapcase() if c.isalpha() else c for c in string)
```

This script provides a function that accepts a string as an argument and returns a new string where all lowercase characters are flipped to uppercase and all uppercase characters are flipped to lowercase. This is achieved by using a list comprehension that checks if each character is alphanumeric using the `isalpha()` method, if true, the character is flipped using the `swapcase()` method.
