```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(c.swapcase() if c.isalpha() else c for c in string)
```

This code uses the swapcase function to flip the case for alphabetic characters, and leaves non-alphabetic characters unchanged. The result is then concatenated back into a string. The `isalpha()` function checks if the character is alphabetic, as the English alphabet exclusively contains uppercase and lowercase letters.

To test this, we can use the following sample test code:
```python
def test_flip_case():
    assert flip_case("hello World") == "HELLO wORLD"
    assert flip_case("ABCDefg123") == "abcDEfg123"
    assert flip_case("fooBAR") == "FOObAR"
    assert flip_case("mile stone") == "miLE STONE"
    assert flip_case("αβδεζηθ") == "αβδεζηθ"
```
