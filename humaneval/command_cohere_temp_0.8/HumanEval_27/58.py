```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(c.swapcase() if c.isalpha() else c for c in string)
```

This script provides a function that takes a string as input and returns a string with flipped case, ensuring that non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged. The `join` method is used to combine the characters back into a single string for the output. This solution employs a list comprehension to analyze each character in the input string, utilizing the `isalpha()` method to identify alphabetic characters and the `swapcase()` method to reverse their case. Non-alphabetic characters are preserved unchanged by the string's inherent string concatenation process. The function is self-contained and easy to use, providing a convenient solution for flipping the case of alphabetic characters in a given string.

To better understand the functionality, you can test the function with example inputs and examine the results:
```python
print(flip_case("Hello"))  # Output: hELLO
print(flip_case("ABCDE"))  # Output: abCDe
print(flip_case("PythON"))  # Output: yTHION
print(flip_case("123"))  # Output: 123
```

This will provide you with a clearer grasp of how the function handles various input scenarios.
