```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(c.swapcase() if c.isalpha() else c for c in string)
```

This script provides a function that accepts a string as an argument and returns a new string with flipped case lettersâ€”uppercase characters are converted to lowercase, and lowercase characters are converted to uppercase. The `swapcase()` method is used for the flip. Non-alphabetic characters like spaces, numbers, and symbols remain unchanged.

To test this function, you can use the following Markdown code block with an example and its expected result:
```python
>>> flip_case('Hello, World!')
'hELLO, wORLD!'
```

This should return 'hELLO, wORLD!' with flipped letters.
