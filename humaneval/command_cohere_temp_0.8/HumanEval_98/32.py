```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    """
    # Define the vowels
    vowels = 'AEIOU'
    # Initialize the count to 0
    count = 0
    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        # Check if the current character is an uppercase vowel and if its index is even
        if char.isupper() and vowels.count(char) % 2 == 1 and i % 2 == 0:
            count += 1
    # Return the count of uppercase vowels in even indices
    return count
```

The code defines a function `count_upper()` which takes a string as an input and counts the number of uppercase vowels in even indices. It first defines the vowels to be checked, initializes the count to 0, and then iterates through each character in the string. If the character is an uppercase vowel and its index is even, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the total count of uppercase vowels in even indices. 

To achieve the desired functionality, the code utilizes the `isupper()` method to check if a character is uppercase, and the modulo operator (`%`) to determine if an index is even, ensuring correctness. 

The unit tests for the function can be written as follows:
```python
import unittest

class TestCountUpper(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_count_upper(self):
        self.assertEqual(count_upper('aBCdEf'), 1)
        self.assertEqual(count_upper('abcdefg'), 0)
        self.assertEqual(count_upper('dBBE'), 0)
        self.assertEqual(count_upper('AEIOU'), 0)
```
