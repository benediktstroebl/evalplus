```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    """
    # Define the vowels
    vowels = 'AEIOU'
    # Initialize the count to 0
    count = 0
    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        # Check if the character is uppercase and a vowel
        if char.isupper() and char in vowels and (i % 2 == 0):

    return count
```

The code defines a function `count_upper()` which takes a string as an argument and counts the number of uppercase vowels in even indices of the string. It first defines a string `vowels` containing all the uppercase vowels. It then initializes a counter variable `count` to 0. Next, it iterates over each character in the input string `s` using a for loop with an `enumerate()` clause which provides both the index `i` and the character `char`. For each character, it checks if it is uppercase and a vowel, and if its index is even. If all these conditions are met, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the total count of uppercase vowels in even indices.
