```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    """
    # Define the vowels to be counted
    vowels = 'AEIOU'
    
    # Initialize the count to zero
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        # Check if the character is uppercase and a vowel
        if char.isupper() and char in vowels:
            # If the index is even, increment the count
            if i % 2 == 0:
                count += 1
    # Return the final count
    return count
```

The code defines a function `count_upper` taking a string `s` as input. It aims to count the number of uppercase vowels present in even indices of the string. It first defines the vowels to be counted ('AEIOU'), initializes a count variable to zero, and then loops through the string. Within the loop, it checks if a character is uppercase and a vowel, and if the index is even (i%2 == 0), it increments the count. Finally, it returns the accumulated count, indicating the number of uppercase vowels in even indices. 

Here is a simple test case to verify the functionality of the function:
```python
test_case = 'aBCdEf'
expected = 1

result = count_upper(test_case)

assert result == expected, f"Expected {expected}, but got {result} for test_case {test_case}"
```

You can extend the test suite to include more complex strings and validate various scenarios.
