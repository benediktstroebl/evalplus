Here's a Python script that contains a function named `count_upper()` which solves the problem as described in the markdown code block:
```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    """
    def check_vowels(char):
        # check if char is an uppercase vowel
        return char.isupper() and char in 'AEIOU'
    
    count = 0
    length = len(s)
    # half the length to iterate through strings with even indices only
    for i in range(length // 2):
        if check_vowels(s[i]):
            count += 1
    return count
```

This function uses a nested approach, with the outer function focused on the main problem and the nested function (`check_vowels`) used to validate if a character is an uppercase vowel. The total number of uppercase vowels in even indices is counted using a `for` loop, half the length of the string to only focus on even indices, and increments the count variable whenever an uppercase vowel is encountered. The function ultimately returns the count, solving the problem as demonstrated with the provided test cases.
