```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    """
    # Define the vowels
    vowels = set(['A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'])
    # Initialize the counter
    count = 0
    # Iterate through the string
    for i in range(0, len(s), 2):
        if s[i].isupper() and s[i] in vowels:
            count += 1
    return count
```
The solution employs a set called `vowels` to store the uppercase vowels, which are the letters to be counted in the even indices of the string. A loop iterates through the string at intervals of 2, checking if the character is uppercase and a vowel. If so, the count is incremented. The result is the total count of uppercase vowels in even positions. 

To follow best practices, the commented-out documentation string (`"""`) provides a description for the function that explains its purpose, inputs, and expected outputs. This makes the code more readable and understandable for others and future reference. 

This code snippet can be imported as a module and called as `count_upper(____________)`, where `__________` should be replaced with the desired input string. The result would be the number of uppercase vowels in even indices of the input string.
