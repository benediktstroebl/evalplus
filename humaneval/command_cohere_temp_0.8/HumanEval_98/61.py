```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    """
    # Define the vowels to be counted
    vowels = 'AEIOU'
    
    # Initialize the count to 0
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        # Check if the current character is uppercase and a vowel
        if char.isupper() and char in vowels:
            # Check if the index is even and increment the count if it is
            if i % 2 == 0:
                count += 1
    # Return the count of uppercase vowels in even indices
    return count
```

The code defines a function `count_upper()` which takes a string `s` as an argument. It counts the number of uppercase vowels in even indices of the string and returns the count. 

To do this, it first defines a string `vowels` containing all the uppercase vowels to be counted. It then initializes a variable `count` to zero to keep track of the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.

The code then iterates through each character of the input string using a for loop and the `enumerate()` function, which gives us the index of each character as well. For each character, it checks if it's uppercase and a vowel, and if its index is even. If both conditions are met, it increments the count.

Finally, the function returns the total count of uppercase vowels in even indices of the string.
