```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    """
    # Define the vowels
    vowels = set(['A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'])
    # Initialize the count to 0
    count = 0
    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        # Check if the character is an uppercase vowel and if its index is even
        if char.isupper() and char in vowels and (i % 2 == 0):
            count += 1
    # Return the count of uppercase vowels in even indices
    return count
```

The code defines a set called `vowels` that contains all the uppercase vowels, initializes a count variable to 0, and then loops through each character in the string, incrementing the count for each uppercase vowel found at even indices. The result is the count of uppercase vowels in even indices.
