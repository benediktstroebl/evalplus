```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    """
    vowels = set('AEIOU')
    return sum(1 for i, char in enumerate(s) if char.isupper() and char in vowels and i % 2 == 0)
```

The function `count_upper` takes a string as input and uses a list comprehension to check if each character in the string is an uppercase vowel and is located in an even index, the latter two conditions are checked via the `isupper` method and the modulo operator `% 2 == 0`, respectively. The sum function then adds up the number of uppercase vowels in even indices and returns the final count. 

Let's break down the code for the `count_upper` function: 

1. The function takes a single argument, `s`, which is the input string for which we want to count the uppercase vowels in even indices.
2. It uses the set constructor `set` to create a set of all uppercase vowels, which are 'AEIOU'. This set is stored in the variable `vowels`. This set is used to quickly check if a character is an uppercase vowel.
3. The function then uses a generator expression, enclosed in parentheses and featuring the `sum` function, to iterate over each character in the string `s`. The generator expression checks three things for each character:
    - `char.isupper()`: This method checks if the character is an uppercase letter.
    - `char in vowels`: This checks if the character is present in the set of uppercase vowels.
    - `i % 2 == 0`: This checks if the index `i` is even. 

4. If all these conditions are true for a particular character, the generator expression yields a result of 1, otherwise, it yields 0. 

5. The `sum` function then adds up all the values yielded by the generator expression, which will be 1 for each uppercase vowel in even indices, and returns the total count. 

The script should be self-contained and easily executable since it includes a precise docstring, the function `count_upper` with its respective tests.
