    # Define the vowels to consider
    vowels = 'AEIOU'
    # Initialize the count of uppercase vowels in even indices
    count = 0
    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if char.isupper() and char in vowels and (i + 1) % 2 == 0:

```

The code defines a function `count_upper()` which takes a string `s` as input and counts the number of uppercase vowels in even indices. It first defines the vowels to be considered and then initializes the count to zero. It iterates through each character in the string using `enumerate()`, checking if the character is uppercase, a vowel, and if it is in an even index. If all conditions are met, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the total count of uppercase vowels in even indices.
