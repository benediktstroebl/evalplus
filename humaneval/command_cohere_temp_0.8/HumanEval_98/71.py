Here's a Python script that contains a function named `count_upper()` which solves the problem as described in the prompt:
```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    
    For example:
    count_upper('aBCdEf') returns 1
    count_upper('abcdefg') returns 0
    count_upper('dBBE') returns 0
    """
    # Using list comprehension to check if each character in even positions is an uppercase vowel
    return sum(1 for i in range(0, len(s), 2) if s[i] in 'AEIOU' and s[i].isupper())
```

This function uses a list comprehension to check if the characters in the even indices are uppercase vowels ('AEIOU') and uppercase letters ('A-Z'). The sum function is used to count the number of uppercase vowels in the even indices. The provided examples in the docstring can be used to test this function. 

You can test this function with the following test cases:
```python
print(count_upper('aBCdEf'))  # Output: 1
print(count_upper('abcdefg'))  # Output: 0
print(count_upper('dBBE'))  # Output: 0
```

The function should return 1 for the first test case, 0 for the second, and 0 for the third, which are the examples precisely provided in the docstring.  This demonstrates the correctness of the function to fulfill the purpose of the given problem.  This approach provides a clear and concise code solution to the problem at hand, which makes it easier to understand and use in other scenarios as well.  This type of problem-solving is highly valuable in Software Development and can be adapted and improved upon as needed.  This approach can be iterated and refined to solve other problems of this nature.
