Here's the Python script with a function that solves the problem:
```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    """
    import re
    
    pattern = re.compile(r'[EO]+')
    matches = pattern.findall(s)
    return sum(1 for _ in matches if _.isupper())
```

This script uses the `re` module to find all occurrences of even indices that contain uppercase vowels. It utilizes the `findall` method to retrieve all matches and then checks if each matched character is an uppercase vowel (both 'E' and 'O'). The sum of matches is returned, indicating the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
