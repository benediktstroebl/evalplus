Here's a Python script that contains a function named `count_upper()` which solves the problem as described in the markdown code block:
```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    """
    # Using list comprehension to check if each character in the string is an uppercase vowel.
    uppercase_vowels = ['A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']
    count = sum(1 for i, char in enumerate(s) if i % 2 == 0 and char in uppercase_vowels)
    return count
```

This function uses a list comprehension to check if each character at an even index of the string is an uppercase vowel. The sum function is then used to add up the number of uppercase vowels in even indices, which is then returned.

To test this function, you can use the following examples to ensure it returns the correct outputs:
```python
print(count_upper('aBCdEf'))  # Output: 1
print(count_upper('abcdefg'))  # Output: 0
print(count_upper('dBBE'))     # Output: 0
```

The function should return 1 for the first example, 0 for the second, and 0 for the third. Adjust the function as needed to pass the test cases.
