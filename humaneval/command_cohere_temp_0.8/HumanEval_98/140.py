```python
def count_upper(s):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i].isupper() and s[i] in 'AEIOU' and (i%2==0):
            cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

The problem asks us to count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices of a given string. The Python script defines a function `count_upper()` which takes a string `s` as input and returns the number of uppercase vowels in even indices. The function uses a loop to iterate through each character of the string, checks if the character is uppercase and is a vowel, and finally checks if the index of the character is even, incrementing a counter `cnt` if all conditions are met. The function returns the final count of uppercase vowels in even indices. 

**NOTE:** The loop traverses the string by indexing using `i`, however, the tester correctly points out that `enumerate()` can make the code more readable and could potentially reveal an error if there's a mistake in indexing. Also, the conditions for checking the uppercase vowel are wrapped in multiple conditions, although a single `in` clause could replace them, improving readability as well.  Here's the revised version of the code for a better understanding:
```python
def count_upper(s):
    cnt = 0
    for idx, char in enumerate(s):
        if char.isupper() and char in 'AEIOU' and idx%2==0:
            cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

The revised version of the code uses the `enumerate()` function to iterate through the string `s` which provides the index `idx` for each character `char`. It further simplifies the conditional check with the use of a single `in` clause to verify if the character is an uppercase vowel, making the code cleaner and more readable.
