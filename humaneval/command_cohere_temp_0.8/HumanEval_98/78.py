Here's a Python script that contains a function named `count_upper()` which solves the problem as described in the markdown code block:
```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    """
    vowels = 'AEIOU'
    count = 0
    for i in range(0, len(s), 2):
        if s[i].isupper() and s[i] in vowels:
            count += 1
    return count
```

This function takes a string `s` as its argument and first creates a boolean vector `vowels` that includes only uppercase vowels. It then initializes a counter variable `count` to 0 and iterates through the characters in `s` with a step size of 2 using a `for` loop. If the current character is uppercase and is a vowel, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the total count of uppercase vowels in even indices.

The tests for this function could check cases like:
- `count_upper('aBCdEf') == 1`
- `count_upper('abcdefg') == 0`
- `count_upper('dBBE') == 0`

Let me know if I have missed any other relevant test cases or if you would like me to evaluate the function's efficiency and improve it if necessary.
