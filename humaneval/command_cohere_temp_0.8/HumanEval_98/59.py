```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    
    For example:
    count_upper('aBCdEf') returns 1
    count_upper('abcdefg') returns 0
    count_upper('dBBE') returns 0
    """
    upper_vowels = {"A", "E", "I", "O", "U"}
    count = sum(1 for i, char in enumerate(s, start=1) if i % 2 == 0 and char.isupper() and char in upper_vowels)
    return count
```

This script defines a function `count_upper()` that takes a string `s` as input and counts the number of uppercase vowels in even indices. It does this by first creating a list of uppercase vowels (`upper_vowels`) and then using a sum aggregate function to count the number of times a character in an even index matches an uppercase vowel. The answer is then returned. 

This solution should be able to pass the provided tests. Let me know if you have any more questions!
