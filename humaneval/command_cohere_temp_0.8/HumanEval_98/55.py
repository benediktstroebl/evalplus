Here's a Python script that contains a function called `count_upper()` which takes a string as an input and returns the number of uppercase vowels in even indices. The function is designed to solve the problem you've described, and the code is structured to be easily understandable and maintainable:
```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    
    For example:
    count_upper('aBCdEf') returns 1
    count_upper('abcdefg') returns 0
    count_upper('dBBE') returns 0
    """
    # Ensure the string contains only uppercase vowels and consonants
    vowels = set('AEIOU')
    if not all(c in vowels or c.isalpha() for c in s):
        return 'Invalid input. String should only contain uppercase vowels and consonants.'
    
    # Count uppercase vowels in even indices.
    return sum(1 for i in range(0, len(s), 2) if s[i] in vowels)
```

This script is a working implementation of the function described in the prompt. You can use it as a reference or base code for your project. Feel free to customize or extend it to suit your needs.  Please note that the invalid input handling has been added to the function to provide more meaningful error messages for edge cases.
