```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    """
    # Define the vowels to be counted
    vowels = 'AEIOU'
    
    # Initialize the count to 0
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        # Check if the character is uppercase and a vowel
        if char.isupper() and char in vowels:
            # If the index is even, increment the count
            if i % 2 == 0:
                count += 1
    
    # Return the final count
    return count
```

The code defines a function `count_upper` taking a string `s` as input. It aims to count the number of uppercase vowels present in even indices of the string. It first defines the vowels to be counted ('AEIOU'), initializes a count variable to 0, and then loops through the string. Within the loop, it checks if a character is uppercase and a vowel, and if the index is even (i%2 == 0), it increments the count. Finally, it returns the accumulated count.

The block also includes corresponding test cases in the same file to ensure the functionality of the provided solution:
```python
# Test Cases
def test_count_upper():
    # Test case 1: Count uppercase vowels in even indices
    assert count_upper('aBCdEf') == 1
    
    # Test case 2: No uppercase vowels in even indices
    assert count_upper('abcdefg') == 0
    
    # Test case 3: Count uppercase vowels in even indices
    assert count_upper('dBBE') == 0
    
    # Test case 4: Mixed case, only 'E' in even index
    assert count_upper('aBEfcD') == 1

test_count_upper()
```

The test cases will generate output showing the number of tests passed. 

You can add more test cases as needed to cover different scenarios and ensure the correctness of the function.
