```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    """
    # Define the vowels to be counted
    vowels = 'AEIOU'
    
    # Initialize the count to zero
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        # Check if the current character is an uppercase vowel
        if char.isupper() and char in vowels and (i % 2 == 0):
            count += 1

    return count
```

The code defines a function `count_upper` taking a string `s` as input. It aims to count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices of the string. It first defines the vowels to be counted ('AEIOU'), initializes a count to zero, and then iterates through each character in the string. It checks if the character is an uppercase vowel and whether its index is even, incrementing the count if both conditions are met. Finally, it returns the total count of uppercase vowels in even indices, as specified by the problem. The code is encapsulated within a function and provides an explicit docstring, making it readable and easily maintainable.
