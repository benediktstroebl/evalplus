Here's a Python script that contains a function named `count_upper()` which solves the problem as outlined in the markdown code block you provided:
```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    """
    vowels = 'AEIOU'
    count = 0
    for i in range(0, len(s), 2):
        if s[i].isupper() and s[i] in vowels:
            count += 1
    return count
```

This function takes a string s as input and counts the number of uppercase vowels in even indices. It does so by first creating a constant called vowels that has all the uppercase vowels. It then initializes a counter variable count to 0. The function then loops through the characters in the string s, jumping two at a time (because even indices are being checked). Within the loop, it checks if the character is uppercase and a vowel. If it is, it increments the count. Finally, the function returns the count.

This solution is efficient because it takes advantage of the even indices and the limited set of possible uppercase vowels, so it doesn't need to account for all possible characters. The total time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string s. This is because each character is visited once and each check is constant time. The space complexity is O(1) since constant space is used regardless of the input size.
