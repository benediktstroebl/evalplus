```python
def count_upper(s):
    upper_vowels = {"A", "E", "I", "O", "U"}
    count = 0
    for i in range(0, len(s), 2):
        if s[i].isupper() and s[i] in upper_vowels:
            count += 1
    return count
```

This approach leverages string slicing and a predefined set of uppercase vowels to efficiently count the vowels in even indices, ensuring correctness and performance.

The unit tests for this problem could involve various test cases, such as:
```python
def test_count_upper():
    assert count_upper("aBCdEf") == 1
    assert count_upper("abcdefg") == 0
    assert count_upper("dBBE") == 0
    assert count_upper("HelloWorld") == 0
```

These tests cover different scenarios and ensure the function's correctness for the given problem.
