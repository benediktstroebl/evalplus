```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    """
    vowels = set('AEIOU')
    return sum(1 for i, char in enumerate(s) if i % 2 == 0 and char.isupper() and char in vowels)
```

The function uses a set called `vowels` that contains all uppercase vowels. It also utilizes a summation and iteration through each character in the string. The iteration checks for odd or even indices, whether the character is uppercase, and whether the character is in the defined set of vowels. The function then returns the number of matched uppercase vowels in even indices. 

Let's write some test strings against which we can run this function to ensure it operates as expected:
```python
>>> count_upper('aBCdEf')
1

>>> count_upper('abcdefg')
0

>>> count_upper('dBBE')
0
```
This allows us to confirm the function's functionality as desired. 

This function is robust and can handle various strings without alteration. However, it is essential to ensure that the function is dealing with all edge cases involving capital vowels in different linguistic contexts and regardless of the position of the string.
