```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    """
    # Define the vowels
    vowels = 'AEIOU'
    # Initialize the count to 0
    count = 0
    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for i in range(0, len(s), 2):
        if s[i].isupper() and s[i] in vowels:
            count += 1
    return count
```

This Python script defines a function called `count_upper` that takes a string as an input and counts the number of uppercase vowels in even indices. The function first defines the vowels to be checked, initializes a counter variable to 0, and then iterates through the string, checking for uppercase vowels in even indices and adding 1 to the count variable for each one. The function returns the final count of uppercase vowels in even indices. 

The `count_upper` function is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem statement in the markdown code block and can be used to pass corresponding tests.  It can be used in other programs to identify the number of uppercase vowels in even indices of a string.
