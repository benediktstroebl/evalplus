Here's a Python script with a function that solves the problem as described in the code block:
```python
def count_upper(s):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(0, len(s), 2):
        if s[i].isupper() and s[i] in 'AEIOU':
            cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

This function `count_upper()` takes a string `s` as input and counts the number of uppercase vowels in even indices. It uses a loop to iterate through the string, checking every second index for an uppercase vowel. If an uppercase vowel is found in an even index, the count is incremented. Finally, the function returns the resulting count. 

The function successfully passes the given tests:
- ```python
test("count_upper('aBCdEf') returns 1", lambda: count_upper('aBCdEf') == 1)
test("count_upper('abcdefg') returns 0", lambda: count_upper('abcdefg') == 0)
test("count_upper('dBBE') returns 0", lambda: count_upper('dBBE') == 0)
```

This script provides a standalone solution to the problem as outlined in the original code block. Feel free to adapt this code to your specific needs. Let me know if you would like me to explain any part of it in more detail.
