```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    """
    # Define the vowels
    vowels = 'AEIOU'
    # Initialize the count of uppercase vowels in even indices
    count = 0
    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if char.isupper() and char in vowels and (i % 2 == 0):
            count += 1
    # Return the count of uppercase vowels in even indices
    return count
```

The code defines a function `count_upper()` which takes a string as an argument and counts the number of uppercase vowels in even indices. It first defines the vowels and then initializes the count to 0. It iterates through each character in the string using `enumerate()` to keep track of the index, and if the character is uppercase and a vowel and its index is even, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the total count of uppercase vowels in even indices. 

To follow best practices, the code includes a docstring that describes the purpose of the function, as well as meaningful variable names, and consistent indentation. Additionally, the code is concise and straightforward, avoiding any unnecessary complexities.
