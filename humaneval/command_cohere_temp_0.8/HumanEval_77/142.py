```python
def iscube(a):
    return a ** (1/3) == int(a ** (1/3))
```
This function simplifies the equation to a single cube root value, which should be an integer if the input is a perfect cube. 

Here is a test drive suite that can be used to validate the function:
```python
def test_iscube():
    assert iscube(1) == True
    assert iscube(64) == True
    assert iscube(180) == False
    assert iscube(0) == True
    assert iscube(-1) == True
    assert iscube(2) == False
``` 

The above test drive suite contains various test cases that cover different scenarios to validate the `iscube` function. You can use them with various testing frameworks to comprehensively ensure the function's correctness. 
If the logic of the `iscube` function seems unclear, consider checking out the breakdown below, which dives into the finer details of the equation and its rationale.

Breakdown of the `iscube` Function

The core equation behind the `iscube` function is `a ** (1/3) == int(a ** (1/3))`. Here's how it breaks down:
1. `a ** (1/3)`: This is the mathematical operation of raising `a` to the power of `1/3`. This operation returns the cube root of `a`. This value is a real number.
2. `int(a ** (1/3))`: This is the conversion of the previous value to an integer. By doing so, any fractional part is removed.
The rationale behind this approach is that if `a` is a perfect cube, its cube root (when expressed as a real number) will be an integer when rounded to the nearest integer. 

Essentially, this equation is checking whether the cube root of `a` rounds down to an integer when expressed as a real number. If it does, it returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This approach leverages the properties of perfect cubes and integer rounding to effectively determine if a given number is a perfect cube. Do you need clarity on any specific aspect of the solution? Feel free to ask, and the explanation can be further detailed for any particular topic!
