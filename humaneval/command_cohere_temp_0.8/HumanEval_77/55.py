```python
def iscube(a):
    return a ** (1/3) == int(a ** (1/3))
```
This function simplifies the equation to a single equality operation and tests the result against the original input, which is the most efficient way to solve this problem.

This approach takes advantage of the int(a ** (1/3)) execution, which is done in finite precision arithmetic, so even if the result is not exactly equal to a, it will be very close to it, and the int datatype will round it to the closest integer. Therefore it is an efficient solution for the "iscube" function.
