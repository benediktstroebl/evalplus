```python
def iscube(a):
    # Check if the integer a is a perfect cube
    return a ** (1/3) == round(a ** (1/3))
```

This function simplifies the equation to check if `a` is a perfect cube, by raising it to `1/3` which allows us to quickly identify whole numbers, and utilizing the `round()` function to check if the result is an whole number, hence, a cube. 

This function returns `True` if the input is a cube of some integer; otherwise, it returns `False`. You can test the function by calling it with different input values and verifying the output.
