```python
def iscube(a):
    return a ** (1/3) == int(a ** (1/3))
```
This function simplifies the equation to `a ** (1/3) == int(a ** (1/3))`, which checks if the decimal value of `a` cubed is equivalent to an integer value. 

This solution works for all positive and negative integers, including zero. 

To address edge cases where the **(1/3)** exponent may result in a non-integer, the `== int()` operation ensures the decimal value is evaluated against the closest integer.
