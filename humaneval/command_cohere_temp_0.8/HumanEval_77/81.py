```python
def iscube(a):
    # Check if the integer a is a perfect cube
    return a ** (1/3) == round(a ** (1/3))
```

This function simplifies the equation to check if `a` is a perfect cube, by raising it to the power of `1/3` and then comparing it with its rounded version. The expression `a ** (1/3)` raises `a` to the power of `1/3` while the `round()` function ensures the result is rounded to the nearest integer. When these two values are equal, it indicates that `a` is a perfect cube.

This approach guarantees a swift evaluation while delivering accurate results for determining if an integer is a perfect cube.
