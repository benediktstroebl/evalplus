```python
def iscube(a):
    # Check if the number is greater than 0
    if a < 0:
        return False

    # Find the largest cube that is less than or equal to a
    max_cube = int(pow(a ** (1/3)), 3)
    
    # If the largest cube is equal to a, return True
    if max_cube == a:
        return True
    return False
```

The above Python code defines a function `iscube` that determines if a given integer `a` is a perfect cube of some integer. It first checks if `a` is greater than zero, returning `False` if it's not. Then, it calculates the largest cube less than or equal to `a` using the formula `max_cube = int(pow(a ** (1/3)), 3)`. If this largest cube is equal to `a`, the function returns `True`, indicating that `a` is a perfect cube; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

The logic efficiently computes the cube conditionally, without requiring explicit calculations of unnecessary cubes. 

This approach enables the function to swiftly determine if an integer is a perfect cube, making it more efficient than brute-force verification against all possible cubes.
