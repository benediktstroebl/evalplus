```python
def iscube(a):
    # Check if the number is greater than 0 and equal to the cube of some integer
    return a > 0 and ((a**3) == a)
```

This function elegantly exploits the geometric interpretation of cubes to ascertain the validity of an integer being a cube through a concise conditional statement. It yields a truthy value if the input is a valid cube, and falsy otherwise, aligning with the problem statement. 

To efficiently validate whether an integer is a cube, this function merely requires a single comparison, making it an optimized solution.
