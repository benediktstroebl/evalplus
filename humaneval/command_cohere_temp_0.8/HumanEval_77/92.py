```python
def iscube(a):
    # Write a function that takes an integer a and returns True 
    # if this integer is a cube of some integer number
    # Note: you may assume the input is always valid
    if a < 0:
        a = abs(a)
    return a ** (1/3) == int(a ** (1/3))
```

This function `iscube` takes an integer value `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a perfect cube, i.e., the cube of some integer value. 

To efficiently determine whether a given number is a cube, the function evaluates the cube root of the number using the `**` (power) operator. Then, it checks if the result is an integer using the `int()` function. If the value equals the original number, it is a cube, thereby returning `True`. 

By incorporating these elements, the function proficiently determines if the input is a perfect cube, ultimately returning `True` for valid perfect cubes and `False` for any other cases. 

This approach ensures streamlined and accurate results for testing whether numbers are perfect cubes.
