```python
def iscube(a):
    # Check if the integer a is a perfect cube
    return a ** (1/3) == round(a ** (1/3))
```

This function simplifies the equation to check if `a` is a perfect cube, by raising it to the power of `1/3` and then comparing it to its rounded version. The result will be equal if `a` is a perfect cube, and will round down if not. Thus, this will correctly identify perfect cubes while also handling the edge case of 0. 

This approach does not require any additional imports and is compatible with Python 3.7 and above.
