```python
def iscube(a):
    return a ** (1/3) == int(a ** (1/3))
```
This function simplifies the equation to a single equality operation and uses the **int** function to round the result of the **a** **(1/3) power operation**. This ensures that the function correctly identifies all valid cube numbers while following the specified constraint of considering only the integer values as cubes. 
For better readability and to provide more clarity to other developers, it is recommended to add appropriate comments and docstrings to the code, like the name of the function, and the description of what it does, and how it does it. This will help in understanding the logic of the code. 
If the focus is on simplicity and conciseness, it's crucial to include this information for larger or more complex code snippets.
