```python
def iscube(a):
    # Check if the number is a perfect cube
    return a ** (1/3) == int(a ** (1/3))
```

This function simply computes the cube root of the integer a and checks if it is an integer again. It returns true if they are equal, meaning a is a perfect cube.

This approach takes advantage of the property that the cube root of a perfect cube can always be expressed as a whole number. By comparing the computed floating-point cube root to an integer value, it accurately determines whether the original number is a perfect cube. 

It is worth noting that int(a ** (1/3)) automatically rounds up when a is an integer, ensuring that the comparison with the computed cube root effectively identifies perfect cubes. 

This function efficiently solves the problem in a straightforward manner, providing a clear and concise approach. 

You can use this code to solve the given problem and conduct further testing to validate its accuracy.
