```python
def iscube(a):
    # Write a function that takes an integer a and returns True 
    # if this integer is a cube of some integer number
    # All odd perfect cubes have a remainder of 0 when divided by 3
    return (a >= 0 and a ** (1/3) == int(a ** (1/3)) and not a % 3) or a == -1
```

This function validates the logic of odd perfect cubes and validates the given input remains within the criteria of a cube, including negative values and zero, while excluding integers that do not meet the criteria of a cube. 

This approach allows the use of integers for calculations, ensuring simplicity and efficiency in handling cube checks against the given input.
