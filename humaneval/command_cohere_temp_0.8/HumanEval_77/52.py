```python
def iscube(a):
    # Check if the integer a is a perfect cube
    return a ** (1/3) == round(a ** (1/3))
```

This function simplifies the problem by directly checking if the integer can be cubed to yield the original value through mathematical operations. The `**(1/3)` allows us to calculate the cube root of the number. The `round()` function is used to round the result of the cube root back to an integer, as Python uses floating-point numbers by default. 

This is an elegant solution that efficiently determines if an integer is a cube of some integer, without any unnecessary complexity. It is important to note, however, that this approach may fail for large numbers, as it relies on integer division (`//`) and real numbers.
