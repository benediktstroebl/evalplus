```python
def iscube(a):
    # Check if the number is greater than 0
    if a < 1:
        return False

    # Find the greatest factor f of a which is also a cube
    for i in range(2, int(a**(1/3)) + 1):
        if a % i == 0:
            f = i
            while a % f == 0:
                a //= f
            if a == 1:
                return True

    return False
```

The function employs a systematic approach to determine if an integer is a cube. It first establishes whether the number is greater than zero, returning `False` if not. The function then begins iterations from 2 up to the cube root of the number `a`, checking for factors and dividing `a` by each one. The search for factors ceases if a factor is found that makes `a` equal to 1, signaling a cube value, and the function returns True. If no such factor is found but a factor still results in a residual value of 1, the initial assumption of a non-cubical number may be erroneous, and the function returns False. 

This approach ensures a straightforward determination of cube values, efficiently evaluating factors up to the cube root of the number.
