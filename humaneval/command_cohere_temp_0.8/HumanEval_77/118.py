```python
def iscube(a):
    # Check if the number is divisible by 2 and then 3
    if a % 2 == 0 and a % 3 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This function checks if the number `a` is a perfect cube by checking if it is divisible by 2 and then 3. A number is a perfect cube if it can be expressed as the cube of an integer. This is the decisive property we are exploiting here. 

Examples:
- iscube(1) ==> True
- iscube(8) ==> True 
- iscube(2) ==> False 
- iscube(-1) ==> True 

This function returns True if the number is a cube, and False if it is not. 

The `%` operator returns the remainder of the division of the number by the divisor. Thus, `a % 2` returns the remainder of a divided by 2, and so on.
