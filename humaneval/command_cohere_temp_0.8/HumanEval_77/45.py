```python
def iscube(a):
    # Check if the integer a is a perfect cube
    return a ** (1/3) == round(a ** (1/3))
```

This function simplifies the equation to check if `a` is a perfect cube, by raising it to the power of `1/3` and then comparing it to its rounded version. It returns true if they are equal, and false if they are not.

This approach saves us from unnecessary iterations and potential errors.
