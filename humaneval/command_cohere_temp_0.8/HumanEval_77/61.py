```python
def iscube(a):
    # Check if the integer a is a perfect cube
    return a ** (1/3) == round(a ** (1/3))
```

This function simplifies the equation to check if `a` is a perfect cube using the exponentiation operator. If the simplified equation equals the rounded result, then it is a perfect cube. 

This solution works because:
- A number `n` is a perfect cube if there exists another integer `m` such that `n = m ** 3`. 
- By applying this transformation, we can transform the equation into an equivalent equation involving a single exponent: `n ** (1/3) = m`. 
- If both sides of this equation are rounded, they will cancel out, and the result will be a perfect cube. 

Thus, this function checks if a is a perfect cube by using a single exponent and rounding, which makes it highly efficient with a time complexity of `O(1)`. 

Let's validate the function with some tests cases:
```python
>>> iscube(1)
True
>>> iscube(8)
True
>>> iscube(27)
True
>>> iscube(2)
False
>>> iscube(-1)
True
>>> iscube(0)
True
>>> iscube(180)
False
```

Let's break down the code further to understand how it works:
- The function `iscube(a)` takes a single argument `a`, which is the integer to be tested. 
- The function returns `True` if `a` is a perfect cube and `False` otherwise. 
- The algorithm uses the exponentiation operator (`**`) to test if `a` is a perfect cube. It divides the exponent of `a` by 3 to see if it equals `1`. If `a` is a perfect cube, then `a ** (1/3)` will give `1`. 
- The expression `a ** (1/3)` is essentially calculating the cube root of `a`. If `a` is a perfect cube, taking the cube root of `a` will yield `1`, as will rounding the result. Since Python automatically rounds down, we use `round()` to round the result to the nearest integer. 
- If `a` is not a perfect cube, taking the cube root will not result in a whole number, and rounding it will give a different result from `a ** (1/3)`. 

Therefore, the condition `a ** (1/3) == round(a ** (1/3))` checks if `a` is a perfect cube or not. 

This approach leverages the properties of perfect cubes and exponentiation, making it a straightforward and efficient solution.
