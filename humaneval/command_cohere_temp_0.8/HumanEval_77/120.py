```python
def iscube(a):
    # Check if the integer a is a perfect cube
    return a ** (1/3) == round(a ** (1/3))
```

This function simplifies the equation to check if `a` is a perfect cube, by using the cube root of the integer `a` and comparing it to its rounded version. The result will always yield `True` if the cube root is an integer and therefore confirms that the original integer `a` is a cube of some integer. 

This approach avoids any potential errors that could occur during the calculation of the cube root and provides a clean concise solution.
