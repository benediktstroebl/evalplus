```python
def iscube(a):
    # Factorize the integer
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, int(a**.5) + 1):
        while a % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            a //= i
    if a > 1:
        factors.append(a)
    
    # Check if there are 3 factors of the same number
    return len(factors) == 3 and factors.count(factors[0]) == 3
```
The factorization process exploits the prime factorization of cubes, which always has 3 factors of the same number, whereas other integers may not have any or have fewer than three. 

Here is a breakdown of how the code works:
- At first, the integer `a` is factorized. This is done by looping over all integers from 2 up to the square root of `a` (inclusive) and repeatedly dividing `a` by the current integer as long as the remainder is 0. The respective integer is added to a list of factors.
- If after the factorization there is a remainder (i.e. `a` is not divisible by the square root of `a`), it is also added to the list of factors.
- The list of factors is then checked to see if it has exactly three elements and if these three elements are all equal (which would mean that `a` is a cube). 

Such a straightforward and efficient approach enables the function to effortlessly determine whether an integer is a cube. 

This code assumes that valid input will always be a positive integer. If negative numbers are considered valid inputs, the code can be modified to accommodate this.
