```python
def iscube(a):
    return a ** (1/3) == int(a ** (1/3))
```
This function simplifies the equation to `a ** (1/3) == int(a ** (1/3))`, which checks if the decimal value of `a` is equivalent to a cube of an integer. 

Here's a step by step explanation of how the code works:
1. `a ** (1/3)`: This is the numerator of the equation and represents the decimal form of the cube root of `a`.
2. `int(a ** (1/3))`: This converts the decimal value of the cube root to the nearest integer value.
3. The equality check `==` returns `True` if the numerator and the denominator are equal, which indicates that `a` is a perfect cube.

The function returns `True` if the input `a` is a perfect cube and `False` otherwise. 

This approach assumes that the input is a valid integer and does not require additional validation. Feel free to ask any questions or provide additional insight!
