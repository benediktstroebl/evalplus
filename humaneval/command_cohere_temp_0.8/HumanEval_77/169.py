```python
def iscube(a):
    # Factorize the integer
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, int(a ** (1/3) + 1)):
        while a % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            a //= i
    if a != 1:
        factors.append(a)
    # Filter out the cube factors
    factors = [i for i in factors if i ** 3 == a]
    return len(factors) == 1
```

The problem is solved using straightforward factorization; the only sophisticated tool required is a loop that iterates through potential cube root candidates. To save on computational power, we stop the loop at `int(a ** (1/3) + 1)`, assuming that the cube root is always within that range. After factorizing, we filter out the actual cube factors from the list and check if the length of this list is 1, meaning that the input integer is a cube of a single integer.
