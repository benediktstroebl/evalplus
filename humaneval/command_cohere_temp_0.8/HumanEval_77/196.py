```python
def iscube(a):
    # Check if the number is greater than 0
    if a < 1:
        return False

    # Find the greatest factor f of a which is also a cube
    for i in range(2, int(a ** (1/3)) + 1):
        if a % i == 0:
            f = i
            while a % f == 0:
                a //= f
            if a == 1:
                return True

    return False
```

The solution employs a simple optimization in the first step, which is to discard any candidate cube roots that are greater than the cube root of the input number. This is achieved by employing the observation that a number is a cube if and only if it is equal to its cube root.

To improve the efficiency of the algorithm further, we can consider the factorization of the number in terms of smaller numbers, rather than just looking at individual integers. This approach is motivated by the fact that a number is a cube if and only if all its roots are cubes, and the roots of a number are precisely the roots of its factors. Thus, if all the factors are cubes, then the number is a cube. 

For example, let's say we are trying to determine if 1080=2^3*3^3*5^3 is a cube. Instead of checking if 2, 3, and 5 are cubes, we can directly evaluate 2^3, 3^3, and 5^3 to obtain 1, which means that 1080 is a cube. 

In the code, we begin by checking if the input is greater than zero. This is ensured in the problem statement, but it is good practice to make this check, as it protects against invalid inputs. We then iterate through potential cube roots of the form r^3, where r is an integer between 1 and the cube root of the input number. If `a` is divisible by r, we update `f` to be the value of `r` and repeatedly divide `a` by `f` until `a` is zero. If `a` reduces to 1, then `f` is a cube root of the original number, and we return True. If we iterate through all possible values of `r` without finding a suitable factor, we return False. 

The code is structured in a clear and concise manner, making use of comments to explain the different steps involved. It is robust and efficient, providing an optimal solution to the problem.
