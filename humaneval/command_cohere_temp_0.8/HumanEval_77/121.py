```python
def iscube(a):
    return a ** (1/3) == int(a ** (1/3))
```
This function simplifies the equation to a single comparison, which speeds up the process. 

By multiplying a with itself three times, then taking the integer value of the result, the expression (a ** (1/3)) will return the original value a if and only if a is a perfect cube. The function will return True if the equivalence is true, meaning that a is a perfect cube, and False otherwise. 

This is the cleanest and most efficient solution to the problem, with a time complexity of O(1). 

Please note that the assumed validity of the input, especially for negative numbers, is an important consideration when designing robust solutions for real-world scenarios.
