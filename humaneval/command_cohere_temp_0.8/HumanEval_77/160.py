```python
def iscube(a):
    # Check if the number is greater than 0
    if a < 1:
        return False

    # Find the integer cube root of the number
    cube_root = int(pow(a, (1/3)))

    # Check if the cube root is an integer and the input is the cube of that integer
    return cube_root == int(cube_root) and a == cube_root ** 3
```

This function adheres to the problem's constraints, assuming that the input is always valid. It utilizes the integer cube root algorithm and returns True if the input is a cube of some integer, False otherwise.

To verify the function, you can run it with the examples provided in the prompt.
