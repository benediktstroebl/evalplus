```python
def iscube(a):
    # Check if the integer a is a perfect cube
    return a ** (1/3) == round(a ** (1/3))
```

This function leverages the intrinsic nature of perfect cubes, where any perfect cube can be expressed as the cube of an integer through the equation *a = n ** 3*, where n is an integer. By rewriting this equation in its fractional form 'a = n ** (1/3)' and comparing it to the original integer a, we can effectively determine if a is a perfect cube. The `round()` function is used to eliminate minor discrepancies that might arise due to floating-point numbers, ensuring an accurate comparison. 

The function returns True if a is a perfect cube and False otherwise.
