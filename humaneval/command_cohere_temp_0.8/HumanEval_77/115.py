```python
def iscube(a):
    # Check if the number is greater than 0
    if a < 1:
        return False

    # Find the integer cube root using integer division
    cube_root = a ** (1/3)

    # Check if the cube root is an integer
    if not cube_root.is_integer():
        return False

    # If all conditions are met, return True
    return True
```

The `iscube` function checks if `a` is greater than 0 to ensure it is valid to take an integer cube root. It then calculates the integer cube root of the number `a` by taking the integer division of `a` by 3. Subsequently, it evaluates whether the cube root is an integer utilizing the `is_integer()` function to ascertain if `a` is a cube of an integer. Finally, it returns `True` if all conditions are met; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(1), making it optimally fast, and it is a straightforward approach to solving this problem.
