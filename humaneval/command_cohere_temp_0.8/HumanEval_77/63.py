```python
def iscube(a):
    # Check if the integer a is a perfect cube
    return a ** (1/3) == round(a ** (1/3))
```

This function simplifies the equation to check if `a` is a perfect cube using the exponentiation operator. If the simplified equation is true, then it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. 

You can test this function by calling it with different input values to see if it returns the correct results based on the given problem statement.
