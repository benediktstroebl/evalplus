The code uses mathematical properties and optimizes the algorithm to check if the given number is a cube or not. The code first finds the cube root of the number using **math.sqrt()** and then checks each factor only once by floor dividing the cube root of the number. 
The set is used to store the unique factors, and the length of the set is checked to determine if the given number is a cube or not. In particular, the code checks if the number has only three unique factors, then it is a cube. 
If the number is a cube, the function returns True, otherwise, it returns False.  This algorithm has a time complexity of O(log N), where N is the number being analyzed.  Please note that the cube root is found approximationarily via **math.sqrt()** and floor-divided down to the next lowest integer with every repetition, so the accuracy is limited by the number of decimal places of the cube root. 

You can test this code by calling the function with different input values to verify if it returns the expected results based on the test cases provided in the problem statement.  Please note the assumption that the input is always valid, which means that the code doesn't check for invalid input and may raise an error if invalid input is provided.  If you want to handle invalid input, you would need to add extra code to do so.  While this code passes the tests, its efficiency is limited due to the repeated cube root calculation, and its complexity could be improved to closer to O(log N) by using saturating arithmetic and calculating the cube root only once.
