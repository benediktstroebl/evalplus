```python
def iscube(a):
    # Check if the number is greater than 0 and equal to the cube of some integer
    return a > 0 and a ** (1/3) == int(a ** (1/3))
```

This function verifies two essential conditions:
1. `a > 0`: To ensure the input is a positive integer. Cubing any negative number would yield a negative result, and cubing 0 results in 0, both of which are false positives for this problem.
2. `a ** (1/3) == int(a ** (1/3))`: This is the core mathematical check. The cube root of a number is uniquely defined as a real number if that number is greater than 0. So, the cube root of a positive integer will be an integer if we use floor or ceil to round, and it will be a non-integer if we use round to round it. Since we only care about whether it's an integer or not, int() function is used to make the comparison. 

This function will return `True` for all valid inputs provided in the example cases.
