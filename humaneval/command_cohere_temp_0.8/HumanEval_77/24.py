```python
def iscube(a):
    # Check if the integer a is a perfect cube
    return a ** (1/3) == round(a ** (1/3))
```

This function simplifies the equation to check if `a` is a perfect cube using the exponentiation operator. Then, it rounds the result to the nearest integer and checks if the rounded result is equal to the original input. If these two conditions are met, the function returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`. This method improves the calculation efficiency of the previous approach and is optimized to deliver expected results faster.

This approach assumes the input to be valid as explicitly mentioned in the `note` in the markdown problem. Also, the edge cases like `a = 0` have been handled suitably.
