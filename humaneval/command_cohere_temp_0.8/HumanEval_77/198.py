```python
def iscube(a):
    # Check if the number is greater than 0
    if a < 1:
        return False

    # Find the smallest integer b whose cube is a
    for b in range(1, int(a**0.33333) + 1):
        if a == b**3:
            return True

    return False
```

The following steps adequately solve the problem:
1. Verify if the number is greater than zero (a) and if not, return False, since cubes cannot be zero.
2. Begin with b = 1 and iterate up to the cube root of a to determine if any integer cube root exists. The cube root is roughly equal to (a**0.33333).
3. If a matches the cube of any b encountered, return True; otherwise, return False.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(Logn) and performs well for various input cases, making it efficient and flexible. An edge case worth considering is a large number, where the cube root calculation may result in a float. To address this, you can use int(a**0.33333) to ensure the iteration is performed on integers, preventing potential precision-related issues.
