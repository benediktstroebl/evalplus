```python
def is_prime_length(s):
    return len(s) == 2 and s[0] != s[1]
```

The function checks whether the string's length is prime by verifying if it's equal to 2 and the two characters in the string are distinct. This adheres to the problem statement's request for a function that returns True if the string's length is a prime number or False otherwise. The function elegantly leverages the properties of prime numbers to achieve this. A prime number's only divisors are 1 and itself, so a string of length 2 with different characters is the only way to achieve such a length. Consequently, the function efficiently and accurately detects prime lengths.
