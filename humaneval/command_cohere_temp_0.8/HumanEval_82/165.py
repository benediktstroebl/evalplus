    string = str(string)

```

The provided code defines a function `prime_length` that takes a string as input and returns `True` if the length of the string is a prime number, and `False` otherwise.

Inside the `prime_length` function, it first converts the input string to a integer to make the prime checking applicable to the length of the string. It then checks if the string length is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns `False` since prime numbers are defined as numbers greater than 1. It then utilizes the `is_prime` function to check if the length of the string is indeed a prime number or not.

The `is_prime` function implements a optimized primality testing algorithm known as the `6k ± 1` rule, which aims to efficiently filter out non-prime candidates with a stride of 6 in the number space. It recursively checks divisibility by numbers of the form `6k ± 1`, which often catches common non-prime factors. This approach significantly reduces the number of divisions needed compared to a simple linear search.

By using `is_prime` to validate the primality of the length of the string, the `prime_length` function is able to provide an accurate determination of whether the length of the given string is a prime number or not based on the provided test cases.
