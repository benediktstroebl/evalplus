```python
def is_prime_length(length):
    if length <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(length**0.5) + 1):
        if length % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def prime_length(string):
    string_length = len(string)
    return is_prime_length(string_length)
```

The function `prime_length` captures the requirement of testing the length of a string to determine if it represents a prime number. The helper function `is_prime_length` prevents very large factors from appearing in the `for` loop by estimating the bounds of the loop variables to the square root of the length. Both functions are accurate and efficient in their respective prime length and primality testing purposes.
