```python
def is_prime(number):
    if number <= 1:
        return False
    if number <= 3:
        return True
    if number % 2 == 0 or number % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= number:
        if number % i == 0 or number % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def prime_length(string):
    string = str(string)
    if len(string) <= 1:
        return False
    return is_prime(len(string))
```
This Python script defines a function `prime_length` that takes a string as an input and returns True if the length of the string is a prime number or False otherwise. The function uses the `is_prime` function to determine if a given number is prime. It also includes examples in the comments that show how the function should behave when passed different strings. 

The `is_prime` function is also described and explained below:
- If the given number is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime, so it returns False.
- If the given number is 2 or 3, it is a prime number, so it returns True.
- If the given number is divisible by 2 or 3, it is not prime, so it returns False. 
- It then starts checking for divisors greater than 3. It does this by checking if the number is divisible by 2 or 3, and if it is, it returns False. If it's not, it moves on to check numbers 5 and 7, then 11 and 13, and so on, always adding 6 to the last number checked. 

This function benefits from a simple and efficient implementation that solves the problem without any external dependencies. It also has a reasonably good time complexity, making it suitable for analyzing prime lengths of various strings. H here's an example of how you can use this function:
```python
print(prime_length("Hello"))  # Output: True
print(prime_length("abcdcba"))  # Output: True
print(prime_length("kittens"))  # Output: True
print(prime_length("orange"))  # Output: False
```
Note that the `is_prime` function can also be used independently to check if a given number is prime.
