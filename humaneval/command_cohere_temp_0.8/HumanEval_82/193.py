```python
def is_prime_length(input_str):
    str_len = len(input_str)
    is_prime = True  # initialize default value to True
    if str_len < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(str_len**0.5) + 1):
        if str_len % i == 0:
            is_prime = False
            break
    return is_prime
```

The function `is_prime_length()` takes a single argument `input_str`, which is the string for which we want to determine if the length is prime. This function checks if the given string's length is prime or not. It starts by calculating the length of the input string and initializing a boolean variable `is_prime` to `True`. Then, it iterates through numbers from 2 up to the square root of the string length, checking if the length is divisible by any of them. If it is divisible by any, `is_prime` is set to `False`, and the loop breaks. Finally, it returns `is_prime`, which will be `True` if the string length is prime and `False` otherwise.

This solution passes all test cases: "Hello", "abcdcba", "kittens", and "orange". 
Let's verify the correctness of the solution manually:
1. Case: 'Hello'
  - Solution: `is_prime_length('Hello')` runs without errors and returns `True` which is the expected output.
2. Case: 'abcdcba'
  - Solution: `is_prime_length('abcdcba')` runs without errors and returns `True` which is the expected output.
3. Case: 'kittens'
  - Solution: `is_prime_length('kittens')` runs without errors and returns `True` which is the expected output.
4. Case: 'orange'
  - Solution: `is_prime_length('orange')` runs without errors and returns `False` which is the expected output.

The provided solution appears to correctly implement the specified function. It determines whether the length of an input string is a prime number or not, reflecting the specified behavior in the problem statement. You may want to implement unit tests to ensure the solution's correctness against more test cases to boost confidence in the code's robustness.
