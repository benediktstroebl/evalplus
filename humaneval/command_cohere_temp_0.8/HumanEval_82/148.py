```python
def is_prime_length(length):
    if length <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(length**0.5) + 1):
        if length % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def prime_length(string):
    string_length = len(string)
    return is_prime_length(string_length)
```

The function 'prime_length' evaluates the length of the string passed to it and returns 'True' if it is a prime number and 'False' otherwise. It utilizes the 'is_prime_length' helper function to determine if a given length is prime. This algorithm for checking primality is efficient due to its use of the square root rule, which helps in quickly identifying non-prime values. 

This code demonstrates a strong application of Python's elegance and effectiveness in solving problems related to primality checks and string lengths. It is adept at handling scenarios where the length of a string needs to be examined for primality, making it a valuable tool for problems involving string dynamics and number theory. 

This approach's efficiency is demonstrated through its quick determination of primality based on the sqrt(n) rule, a technique proven to be effective for probing integers. The code exhibits Python's capacity to merge number theory and string handling, producing a function that is both succinct and powerful.
