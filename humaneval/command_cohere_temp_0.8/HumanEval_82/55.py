```python
def is_prime(number):
    if number <= 1:
        return False
    if number <= 3:
        return True
    if number % 2 == 0 or number % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= number:
        if number % i == 0 or number % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def prime_length(string):
    string = str(string)
    if len(string) <= 1:
        return False
    if is_prime(len(string)):
        return True
    return False
```

The `is_prime` function checks if a given number is prime using the trial division method with some optimizations, and the `prime_length` function uses it to determine if the length of a given string is prime. 

Here's how the code works:
1. The `is_prime` function first handles special cases where the number is less than or equal to 1, returning `False`. It also handles cases where the number is 2 or 3, which are prime, and returns `True`.
2. For bigger numbers, it performs trial division optimizations. It checks if the number is divisible by 2 or 3, and if so, it returns `False`. 
3. Instead of checking divisibility by consecutive integers, it checks only odd numbers, jumping by 6 (skipping even numbers) in each iteration. This optimization reduces the number of iterations needed.
4. The `prime_length` function takes a string and converts it to be processed by the `is_prime` function. If the length of the string is less than or equal to 1, it returns `False`. If the length is prime, it returns `True`. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)), which is the same as the trial division method used.
