This script defines a function `prime_length()` that takes a string as an input and returns True if the length of the string is a prime number and False otherwise. It utilizes another function `is_prime()` to determine if a number is prime. The `is_prime()` function checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, it returns False immediately. It then iterates from 2 to the square root of the number and checks if the number is divisible by any of these integers. If it is, then it returns False. If it isn't, it returns True. Both functions are well-documented with comments to explain their purpose and how they work.

The test cases in the problem statement are also included and should be modified to test against the corrected `prime_length()` function.
