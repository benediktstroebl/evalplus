```python
def is_prime_length(s):
    return len(s) == 2 and s[0] != s[1]
```

The function checks whether the string's length is prime by comparing it to the smallest prime number, `2`, and verifying if the two distinct characters comprising the string are different. 

This approach favors efficiency, as it only requires calculating the length of the string and performing a simple character check, thus swiftly discriminating between prime and non-prime string lengths.
