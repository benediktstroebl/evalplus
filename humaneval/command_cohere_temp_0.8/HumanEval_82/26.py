```python
def is_prime_length(input_str):
    string_length = len(input_str)
    is_prime = True  # initialize whether the length is prime or not
    if string_length < 2:
        return False  # Handle edge case for length less than 2
    for i in range(2, string_length):
        if string_length % i == 0:
            is_prime = False
            break  # Exit the loop if a divisor is found
    return is_prime
```

To test the edge cases, I added a check to handle cases where the input string's length is less than or equal to 1. Also, the loop starts from `2` (`i = 2`) because the string's length (`1`) is already checked, and any divisor of a prime number must be at least `2`. This simplifies the code and still passes the tests.
