```python
def is_prime(number):
    if number <= 1:
        return False
    if number <= 3:
        return True
    if number % 2 == 0 or number % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= number:
        if number % i == 0 or number % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def prime_length(string):
    string = str(string)
    # converting string to int to handle cases like "11" or "1111"
    length = int(len(string))
    if length <= 1:
        return False
    if is_prime(length):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

The `is_prime` function is introduced to handle the prime-checking process, and it employs a decent efficiency algorithm – the `6k ± 1` divisibility rule – to do so. This rule effectively narrows down potential divisors for the number, decreasing the likelihood of false positives. This optimized approach allows for a quicker determination of prime status, making it more suitable for larger numbers.

The `prime_length` function first casts the string length to an integer to handle cases like `kkkkkkkk`, and then uses `is_prime` to determine if the length is prime. This approach surfaces the prime length status of the input string.

I hope this solution suits your needs. Let me know if you would like me to explain any part of the solution or provide further insights.
