```python
def is_prime(number):
    if number <= 1:
        return False
    if number <= 3:
        return True
    if number % 2 == 0 or number % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= number:
        if number % i == 0 or number % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def prime_length(string):
    string = str(string)
    # converting string to int to handle string length as a prime candidate
    return is_prime(len(string))
```

This script defines a function `prime_length` that takes a string as an input and returns True if the length of the string is a prime number and False otherwise. Inside `prime_length`, we first convert the string to an integer to treat its length as a candidate for primality. Our primality function, `is_prime`, uses a simple algorithm: it checks whether the candidate number is less than or equal to 1, discharges candidates that are less than or equal to 3, and then checks whether the candidate number is divisible by 2 or 3. 

Subsequently, the algorithm proceeds to check divisibility by numbers of the form `i` and `i + 2`, where `i` starts from 5 and increases by 6 in each iteration, to efficiently rule out further non-prime candidates. 

The script efficiently identifies prime string lengths and thereby resolves the problem statement. 

The `prime_length` function undergoes four test cases that verify its correctness: `prime_length('Hello')` should return True, as the length of the string is a prime number; `prime_length('abcdcba')` should return True since the length of the string is also a prime number; `prime_length('kittens')` should return True, as the length of the string is a prime number; and `prime_length('orange')` should return False as the length of the string is not a prime number. 

These tests encompass various scenarios to validate the accuracy of the `prime_length` function.
