This Python code defines a function `is_prime(number)` that utilizes an efficient algorithm known as the `6k ± 1 rule` to determine whether a given number is prime or not. It then has a separate function `prime_length(string)` which verifies whether the length of a string is a prime number. This function first checks if the length is less than 3, then transforms the string's length into an integer before applying the `is_prime` function to determine if it's prime.

The code includes tests in the `prime_length` function to check cases such as `prime_length('Hello')`, `prime_length('abcdcba')`, `prime_length('kittens')`, and `prime_length('orange')`, ensuring the function behaves as expected. 

NOTE: This code uses a more efficient primality testing algorithm (the `6k ± 1 rule`) compared to the previous version, ensuring both speed and accuracy. 
It's important to remember that attempting to determine whether a number is prime can be slower for larger numbers due to the computational complexity of the problem. A direct primality test may be more efficient for large numbers.
