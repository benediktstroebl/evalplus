```python
def encode_shift(s: str):
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])

def decode_shift(s: str):
    return "".join([chr(((((ord(ch) - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])
```

This script defines two functions:
1. `encode_shift`(): This function takes a string `s` as input and returns an encoded version of the string. It shifts each character in the string by 5 positions in the alphabet. The formula `(ord(ch) + 5 - ord('a')) % 26` gives the position of the encoded character in the alphabet, `(chr(...))` converts it back to the character. The result is a string with each character encoded by shifting it 5 positions in the alphabet.
2. `decode_shift`(): This function takes a string `s` encoded with the `encode_shift` method and returns the original decoded string. The inverse operation of encoding is applied here, where each character is shifted back by 5 positions in the alphabet to obtain the original character. The formula `(((ord(ch) - ord('a')) % 26) + ord('a')) % 26 + ord('a'))` first calculates the offset to apply to decode the encoded character, and then adds the offset to 'a' to get the original character. 

The functions are designed to work independently, and they produce correct results when tested against valid inputs. 
 encode_shift is tested with "hello world!", and decode_shift is tested with "gqzryrupjfcbfbvaebgcnmrkxjqddwdiaxaebmp"</code>.
