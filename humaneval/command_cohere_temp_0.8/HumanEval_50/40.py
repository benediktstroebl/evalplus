```python
def encode_shift(s: str):
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])

def decode_shift(s: str):
    return "".join([chr((((ord(ch) - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) % 26) for ch in s])
```

This code defines two functions: `encode_shift` and `decode_shift`. 

`encode_shift` takes a string `s` as input and returns the encoded version of that string. It shifts each character in the string by 5 in the alphabet. It does this by taking the ASCII value of each character, adding 5 (to account for the shift), and then using modulo 26 to ensure the result wraps around to the appropriate position within the alphabet. It then subtracts 'a' from the result to get the new character. This is spelled out in the following line: 
 ```python
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])
``` 

`decode_shift` takes a string `s` as input and returns the original string before encoding. It shifts each character back by 5 in the alphabet in the opposite direction. This is done in the following line:
```python
"".join([chr((((ord(ch) - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) % 26) for ch in s])
```

Overall, the code correctly shifts characters in encoding and decoding, and the functions can be used together to encode and then decode a string.
