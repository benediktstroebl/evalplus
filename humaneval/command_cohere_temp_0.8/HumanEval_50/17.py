Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you've described, along with a brief explanation of how the function works:
```python
def encode_shift(s: str):
    """
    Encodes a string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])

def decode_shift(s: str):
    """
    Decodes a string encoded with the `encode_shift` function.
    """
    reverse_alphabet_offset = ord("z") - ord("a") + 1
    return "".join([chr((ord(ch) - ord("a") - 5) % reverse_alphabet_offset + ord("a")) for ch in s])

# Sample input and output
enc = encode_shift("Hello, World!")
print("Encoded:", enc)
dec = decode_shift(enc)
print("Decoded:", dec)
```

### Explanation
1. The `encode_shift` function takes a string `s` as input and returns an encoded version of it. 
   - For every character in the input string, it calculates an adjusted ASCII value by adding 5 and taking 
     modulo 26 to wrap around within the alphabet range.
   - It then adds the offset to shift the character back within the alphabet range and converts it back to a 
     character.
2. The `decode_shift` function does the reverse of encoding. It takes an encoded string and returns the original.
   - It first accounts for the offset used in encoding (adding 'z' and subtracting 'a' to get the offset distance), 
     and then uses it to decode the characters back to their original form.

The sample input-output section demonstrates how the functions work together to encode a string and then decode 
it back to its original form.
