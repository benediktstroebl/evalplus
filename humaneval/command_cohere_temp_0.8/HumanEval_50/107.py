```python
def encode_shift(s: str):
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])

def decode_shift(s: str):
    return s.translate(str.maketrans("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", "qrstuvwxyzabcdefghi"))
```

The `encode_shift` function shifts every character in the string `s` by 5 in the alphabet, excluding 'a' characters, which have a starting point of 10, and wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet when reaching the end. The `decode_shift` function decodes an encoded string by shifting all characters back to their original positions, creating the opposite translation table of the encoding process. 

This solution allows you to encode and decode strings efficiently using a single function call while maintaining the integrity of the encoding/decoding process. Let's break down the solution and explain each part thoroughly:
1. **`encode_shift(s: str)` Function:**
   - This function takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string that represents the encoded version of the input.
   - It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character `ch` in the input string `s`.
   - For each character, it calculates the new ASCII value by adding 5 to the current ASCII value of the character, excluding 'a' characters which have a starting point of 10.
   - It then takes this value modulo 26 to ensure it wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet if needed.
   - Finally, it subtracts the offset of 'a' (ord('a') - ord('a')) to shift the character back to its correct position in the alphabet, starting from 'a'.
   - The resulting character is then added to a new string that is returned as the encoded output.
2. **`decode_shift(s: str)` Function:**
   - This function takes an encoded string `s` as input and returns the original decoded string.
   - It uses the `translate()` method on the input string `s`.
   - The `translate()` method takes two arguments: a translation table and a text translation table.
   - In the function, we create a translation table using `str.maketrans()` with the first argument being the encoded characters (`"qrstuvwxyzabcdefghi"`) and the second argument being the decoded characters (`"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"`).
   - This translation table effectively maps each encoded character to its corresponding decoded character.
   - The `translate()` method then applies this translation to the input string, shifting each character back to its original position and decoding the string to its original form.

The provided solution employs clever Python techniques like list comprehension, string manipulation, and the `translate()` method to achieve the desired encoding and decoding effects. It's important to note that this solution assumes the input string contains only alphabetic characters, and other characters may be handled incorrectly. It's feasible to enhance this solution to handle a wide range of characters systematically.
