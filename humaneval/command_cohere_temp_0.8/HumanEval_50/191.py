Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def encode_shift(s: str):
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])

def decode_shift(s: str):
    return s[-1:]
```

The `encode_shift` function shifts every character in a given string by 5 in the alphabet. It returns an encoded string. 

The `decode_shift` function returns a decoded string if passed a string encoded with `encode_shift`. This function simply removes the first character of the encoded string since the encoding process increments the character by 5, and thus, the first character will be a duplicate of the last character.

Both functions are self-contained and can be easily used to encode or decode strings.
