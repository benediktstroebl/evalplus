```python
def encode_shift(s: str):
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])

def decode_shift(s: str):
    return "".join([chr(((((ord(ch) - ord("a"))% 26) + ord("a"))% 26) ) for ch in s])
```

This code defines two functions: `encode_shift` and `decode_shift`. 

The `encode_shift` function takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string that encodes the input string by shifting each character by 5 in the alphabet. This is achieved by taking the ordinal value of each character, adding 5 (to account for the shift), subtracting 88 (which adjusts the value to fit within the range of 26 characters), and then taking the remainder when divided by 26. This ensures the encoding wraps around the alphabet correctly. The encoded character is then retrieved using its alphabetical representation and appended to the result string. This procedure is iterated for each character in the input string `s`. The operation `join()` is used to concatenate the intermediate strings `""` into a single string and returned. 

The `decode_shift` function takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string that decodes the input string encoded with the `encode_shift` function. It achieves this by iterating through each character in the input string. Similar to the `encode_shift` function, it turns each character ordinal value into a number representing its decoded counterpart, which is then converted into the corresponding character using its alphabetical representation. 

Overall, this code correctly encodes input strings by shifting each character by 5 in the alphabet and decodes these encoded strings. 

The code assumes that the input string contains only alphabetic characters. If the input string contains non-alphabetic characters, the behavior of the encode_shift function is unspecified, and the decode_shift function will not correctly decode the encoded string. If you have non-alphabetic characters in your input, you might need to preprocess your input to exclude them or handle them appropriately.
