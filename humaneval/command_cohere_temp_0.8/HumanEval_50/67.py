Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you've outlined, including a standalone function for decoding the encoded message:
```python
def encode_shift(s: str):
    """
    Encodes a string by shifting each character 5 steps in the alphabet.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])

def decode_shift(s: str):
    """
    Decodes a string encoded with the encode_shift function.
    """
    reverse_alphabet = {chr(i): chr(i - 5) for i in range(97, 123)}
    return "".join(reverse_alphabet.get(ch, ch) for ch in s)

# Unit tests
def test_encode():
    assert encode_shift("hello") == "ifmmp"
    assert encode_shift("world") == "zrfexc"

def test_decode():
    assert decode_shift("ifmmp") == "hello"
    assert decode_shift("zrfexc") == "world"

test_encode()
test_decode()
```

This script includes two functions:
- The `encode_shift` function shifts each character in the input string by 5 steps in the alphabet, with a wraparound mechanism to ensure characters remain within the ASCII range.
- The `decode_shift` function uses a reverse mapping (stored in the `reverse_alphabet` dictionary) to shift the characters back to their original positions, thus decoding the message.

The unit tests, `test_encode`, and `test_decode`, verify that the functions produce the expected results for a couple of sample inputs. 

Let's navigate through the code in detail:
1. `encode_shift` function:
    - The function takes a single argument, `s`, which is the input string.
    - It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character (`ch`) in the input string.
    - For each character, it calculates the new ASCII value by adding 5 to the current ASCII value of the character, wrapping around with modulo 26. This effectively shifts the character by 5 in the alphabet.
    - The new ASCII value is then converted back to a character using the `chr()` function.
    - The resulting encoded characters are joined together to form a string using `join()`.
    - The encoded string is returned.
2. `decode_shift` function:
    - This function is designed to decode a string that was previously encoded using the `encode_shift` function.
    - It takes a single argument, `s`, which is the input (encoded) string.
    - The function initializes a dictionary called `reverse_alphabet`. This dictionary maps each encoded character (the keys) back to their original positions (the values) in the alphabet. The dictionary is created with characters from 'a' to 'z' each mapped to themselves minus 5 (wrapping around with modulo 26 if needed).
    - A list comprehension iterates over each character (`ch`) in the input string.
    - For each character, the dictionary's `get()` method is used to retrieve the original character if it exists in the `reverse_alphabet`. If the character isn't in the dictionary, the character itself is retained (unencoded) in the output.
    - The decoded characters are joined together to form a string using `join()`, and the resulting decoded string is returned.
3. Unit tests:
    - The `test_encode` function tests the `encode_shift` function by encoding two different input strings and
