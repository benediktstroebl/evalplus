Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you've outlined, along with a markdown code block showing the complete script:
```python
def encode_shift(s: str):
    """
    Encodes a string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet.
    
    Args:
        s (str): Input string to be encoded.
        
    Returns:
        str: Encoded string.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])

def decode_shift(s: str):
    """
    Decodes a string encoded with the encode_shift function.
    
    Args:
        s (str): Input string to be decoded.
        
    Returns:
        str: Decoded string.
    """
    return "".join([chr((((ord(ch) - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) % 26) for ch in s])

# Sample usage:
def main():
    original_string = "Hello, World!"
    encoded_string = encode_shift(original_string)
    decoded_string = decode_shift(encoded_string)
    
    print("Original String:", original_string)
    print("Encoded String:", encoded_string)
    print("Decoded String:", decoded_string)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This script defines the `encode_shift` and `decode_shift` functions, and a `main` function to demonstrate the encoding and decoding process. You can copy and paste the code into a Python environment to test it. 

Let's break down the key components:
1. `encode_shift` function: This function takes an input string `s` and encodes it by shifting each character by 5 in the alphabet. It achieves this by calculating the new ASCII value of each character using the formula `(old_ASCII + 5) % 26`, which wraps around the alphabet to stay within the range of 'a' to 'z'. It then subtracts 97 from the new ASCII value to get the corresponding character as a string, which it joins to form the encoded string.
2. `decode_shift` function: This function takes an input string encoded with the `encode_shift` function and decodes it. It reverses the encoding process by shifting the characters back by 5 in the alphabet using a similar formula as in the encoding process.
3. `main` function: This function demonstrates the encoding and decoding process. It takes the string "Hello, World!" (you can replace it with any string you want to encode and decode), encodes it using `encode_shift`, and then decodes it using `decode_shift`. It prints the original string, the encoded string, and the decoded string.

You can use this script to easily encode and decode strings using the specified shift algorithm. Feel free to adapt this code to your needs or explore more features as required. If you have additional questions or requirements, please let me know!
