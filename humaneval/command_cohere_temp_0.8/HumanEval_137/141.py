The function compares two numbers, one of which could be a string representing a real number. It first checks the types of the two variables to return the larger one if they are different. If the types are the same, it compares the values to return the larger one; otherwise, it returns None. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(compare_one(1, 2.5))     # Output: 2.5
print(compare_one(1, "2,3"))    # Output: "2,3"
print(compare_one("5,1", "6"))  # Output: "6"
print(compare_one("1", 1))      # Output: None
``` 

This will output the larger value of the two variables in their respective types, or None if the values are equal.
