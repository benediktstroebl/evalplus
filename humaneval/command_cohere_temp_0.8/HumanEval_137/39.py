    return b
```
The function compares two number-like objects `a` and `b`, it returns the object that is largest. The function returns `None` if the values are equal. The function works with strings and with plain numbers, handling both types and variations of floating point notation. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(compare_one(1, 2.5))  # Should print: 2.5
print(compare_one(1, "2.3"))  # Should print: "2.3"
print(compare_one("5.1", "6"))  # Should print: "6"
print(compare_one("1", 1))  # Should print: None
```
