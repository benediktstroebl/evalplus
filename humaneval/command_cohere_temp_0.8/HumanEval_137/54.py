This function compares two real numbers, with the condition that one or both inputs may be passed as strings. The function first checks that both inputs are either `int`, `float`, or `str`, and then uses Python's built-in comparison to find the larger number. The function returns `None` if the two values are equal. 

This function should be robust for any valid input, as long as the inputs are typed correctly.

To test this function, the following inputs could be passed:

```python
print(compare_one(1, 2.5))  # Expected output: 2.5
print(compare_one(1, "2.5"))  # Expected output: "2.5"
print(compare_one("1,5", "6"))  # Expected output: "6"
print(compare_one("1", 1))  # Expected output: None
```

This should output:

```
2.5
"2.5"
6
None
```

However, this function may not work as expected if the inputs are not typed correctly, as shown in the following example:

```python
print(compare_one("1", 2))  # Output does not match the expected output due to input type
```

The output for this code snippet should be `1`, but the function will first raise a `TypeError` because the inputs are not typed correctly. 

It is crucial to ensure that you properly type-check your inputs to ensure the function behaves as expected.
