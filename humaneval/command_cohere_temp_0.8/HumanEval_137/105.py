The function `compare_one` takes two parameters A and B and compares them according to a specific rule:
1. The function checks whether the types of the variables are the same, if they are not the same, it will proceed to the next condition. 
2. The function checks whether the variable A is a string that could be converted to a float number and is greater than variable B, if true, it returns the string A. Otherwise, it passes the control to the next condition. 
3. The function checks whether the variable B is a string that could be converted to a float number and is greater than variable A, if true, it returns the string B. Otherwise, it passes the control to the next condition. 
4. The function checks whether both variables A and B are integer or float numbers and returns the greater one. 
5. If none of the above conditions are satisfied, it means that the variables are equal or one of them is not a string that could be converted to a float number, so the function returns None. 

Additionally, there is a function `sync_float_str` that is a temporary function to synchronize the comparison of strings and floats. This function ensures that the comparison is correct without the need for converting strings to floats and avoids the associated drawbacks. 

The script includes inline documentation to describe the purpose of the functions and the steps that happen in each one of them.
