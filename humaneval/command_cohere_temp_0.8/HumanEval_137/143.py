The function compares two numbers, one of which could be a string representing a real number. The function first checks the types of the two variables to return the larger one if they differ. If the types are the same, the function compares the values of the numbers and returns the larger one. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
result = compare_one(1, 2.5)
print(result)  # Output: 2.5

result = compare_one(1, "2,3")
print(result)  # Output: "2,3"

result = compare_one("5,1", "6")
print(result)  # Output: "6"

result = compare_one("1", 1)
print(result)  # Output: None
