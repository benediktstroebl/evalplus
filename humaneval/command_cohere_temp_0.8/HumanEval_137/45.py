The function compares two numbers, one of which could be a string representing a real number. It checks the type of the two inputs, ensuring that they are the same, and then compares them accordingly. It also accounts for situations where one of the numbers is an integer and the other is a string, or where both numbers are floating point numbers. 

Here is an example of how to use the function: 
```python
print(compare_one(1, 2.5))  # Expected output: 2.5
print(compare_one(1, "2.3"))  # Expected output: "2.3"
print(compare_one("5.1", "6"))  # Expected output: "6"
print(compare_one("1", 1))  # Expected output: None
``` 
This should output:
```
2.5
"2.3"
"6"
None
```

This revised code includes discrete checks for the different possible combinations of input types, simplifying the process further. It also checks for incompatible or unexpected input types, returning an error message in these cases. 

Let me know if you'd like to further refine the solution or if you'd like me to walk through how the tests could be created for this problem. P
