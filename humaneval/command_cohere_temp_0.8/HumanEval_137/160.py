The function compares two numbers, one of which could be a string representing a real number. It first checks the types of the two to return the larger one if they differ. If the types are the same, it compares the values. If the values are equal, it returns `None`. This approach ensures that the largest value is returned if the inputs are real numbers represented as strings.
