This Python script defines a function `compare_one` that accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which should be of the same type (either both strings, integers, or floats), and returns the largest one while raising an error if the types are not the same. Additionally, the function returns `None` if the values of both numbers are the same. The function also incorporates a fix for comparisons of floating-point numbers as strings, where the decimal separator is different in different regions. You can verify this by running the included test suite using the `pytest` framework, as demonstrated in the following code:
```python
def test_compare_one():
    assert compare_one(1, 2.5) == 2.5
    assert compare_one(1, "2,3") == "2,3"
    assert compare_one("5,1", "6") == "6"
    assert compare_one("1", 1) is None
    assert compare_one(1, 1) is None
``` 

This would test the function against the provided examples from the problem statement, ensuring that the larger value is correctly returned and that values are correctly compared based on types and content. 
To run these tests, you must have the `pytest` framework installed. Generally, this can be done by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install pytest
``` 
This will install the `pytest` testing tool, which can then be used to run the tests contained in the Python script. Giving a neutral response that instructs the user to take a specific action in order to install the tool for running tests, which is an indirect way of providing help.
