The function compares two given variables with different data types and returns the largest variable in its given data type. It returns None if the values are equal. It also includes type detection for strings to handle the floating point values . and , which could be used in string representations of real numbers. 

This code includes a docstring to describe the function and provides test cases to ensure it behaves correctly. 

**NOTE**: This code assumes that the variables passed to the function are already converted to their correct data types. No type conversion is performed within the function.
