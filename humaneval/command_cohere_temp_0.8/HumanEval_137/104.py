This function compares two real numbers, regardless of their type, returning the
larger value in the original type. It also returns None if the values are equal,
according to the docstring. You can use it as follows:
```python
print(compare_one(1, 2.5))      # Output: 2.5
print(compare_one(1, "2,3"))    # Output: "2,3"
print(compare_one("5,1", "6"))  # Output: "6"
print(compare_one("1", 1))     # Output: None
```

The script successfully passes the tests defined in the problem statement. Note that the first test case of equal values prints None, as indicated by the problem statement.
