```

The function compares two numbers, one of which could be a string containing a number. It checks the types of both inputs. If the types are different, it returns the larger value only if it is of the same type as the first parameter. If the types are the same, the function returns None if the values are equal, and the larger value otherwise. The tests passed with the solution. 
This solution is concise and relatively clear, but it will be even better if we could have some context about the expected data and usage, which could allow us to maybe format the output better, etc., based on the use case. Let me know if you like this solution or if you have any further questions or modifications! I am happy to revise it if you have a different idea for structure or style.
