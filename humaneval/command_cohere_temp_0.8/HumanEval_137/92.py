This Python script defines a function `compare_one` that accepts two variables with numerical values, prioritizing the variable type with the widest tolerance for multiple numeric types, and string type. The function is then applied to the given test cases in a list of print statements to verify its correctness against the specified conditions. 

The code uses Python's `isinstance` comparison to determine the type of the two variables and then establishes a lambda comparison function to compare the variables in the prioritized order. The lambda function compares the strings lexicographically and compares integers and floats numerically. In this way, the code ensures that the intended "larger" relationship between the compared values is achieved for the given test cases, with the correct values printed as results.
