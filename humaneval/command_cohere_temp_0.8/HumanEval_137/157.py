The function compares two number-like variables of different types. It prioritizes string types, as they are the most precise, then float types, and finally integer types. The function returns the larger value in its given type or None if the values are equal. 

Note: The assumption of the expected outputs in the comments is based on the note section in the provided prompt, which states that a real number represented as a string gives priority to the floating point . or . If a different priority order or floating point distinction should be applied, the code can be adjusted accordingly.
