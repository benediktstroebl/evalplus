The solution uses a recursive approach where it checks the type of the two variables, their values, and returns the larger one. In some cases, when the larger value is a string and the other is a number, it returns the string representation of the number unless they are equal, in which case it returns `None`. The tests included validate the behavior of the function and check edge cases.
