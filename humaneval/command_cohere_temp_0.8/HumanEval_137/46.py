The function compares two numbers, one of which could be a string representing a real number. It first checks whether the two objects are of the same type. If they are not, it returns the larger one if both types are integer or float, or the string representation of the number if one of the types is string. If the types are the same, it compares the values, returning None if they are equal, and the larger value otherwise. 

This approach ensures that the function adheres to the problem requirements, correctly identifying the larger value without converting string representations to float unless necessary. 

The tests that could be used to verify this solution are included in the code block above, along with the solution. Two test values are provided for each test case, and the expected output is shown accordingly.
