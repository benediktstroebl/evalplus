The problem asks us to create a function that takes different data types and their values into consideration. The function should return the larger value of the two inputs, taking into account that if a real number is given as a string, the decimal point might be a . or a ,. The function compares the values of the given inputs and returns the larger value based on the specified criteria. It also takes into account that if the values are equal, it returns `None`. 

This code includes a self-contained Python script with the `compare_one` function that solves the problem statement, along with corresponding tests to ensure that the function behaves as expected.
