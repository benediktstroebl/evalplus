The provided code defines a Python function compare_one that takes two parameters a and b, which can be integers, floats, or strings representing real numbers. It returns the larger of the two values, or None if they are equal. The function checks the types of a and b to determine the appropriate comparison and handling of string representations of real numbers. It then performs the comparison while considering the types and returns the larger value as specified by the problem statement.

Here's a summary of how it works:
1. The function starts by setting three instance variables `string_number`, `a`, and `b` to `False`, `None`, and `None`, respectively, to ensure that the variables are properly reset for each call.
2. It then checks the types of a and b to handle different scenarios:
    - If the types of a and b are not the same, it further checks their types to determine the correct comparison method.
    - If a and b are both strings, it sets `string_number` to True to indicate that the result should be returned as a string if further comparisons yield a string.
    - If a and b are both numeric (either int or float), it directly assigns the maximum value to variable a using the max() function.
    - If a is a string and b is numeric, it assigns the string value to variable a.
    - If a is numeric and b is a string, it assigns the numeric value to variable a.
3. After the initial type checking and assignment, the function proceeds to compare the values of a and b. If they are equal, it returns None. Otherwise, it sets the variable a to the larger value based on the previous assignments.
4. Finally, it returns the value of a, which represents the larger value of the input parameters.
