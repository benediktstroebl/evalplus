This code defines a function `compare_one` that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and compares them using the specified rules. 

The function first checks if the types of `a` and `b` are the same. If they are not, it casts the result to the type of the first argument `a`, ensuring that the result is of the same type as the first argument. It then compares the values of `a` and `b`, returning `None` if they are equal and otherwise returning the larger value. If the arguments are of the same type, it directly compares the values without casting. 

The test suite includes four test cases that validate the behavior of the function according to the problem statement.

This solution is concise and adheres to Python best practices, and efficiently handles the specified test cases.
