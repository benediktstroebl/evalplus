The function compares two numbers, one of which may be a string that
represents a real number. The function returns the larger of the two, but
returns None if the values are equal. The function also ensures that if one
of the values is a string, that the return value is also a string, even if
the other value is a number.

Here's an example of using the function:
```python
print(compare_one(1, 2.5))     # Output: 2.5
print(compare_one(1, "2,3"))    # Output: "2,3"
print(compare_one("5,1", "6"))  # Output: "6"
print(compare_one("1", 1))      # Output: None
```

The script also includes test coverage, asserting that the function works
as expected for a variety of test cases. 

Overall, the code provides an effective solution to the problem, handling
various input scenarios with type consistency and accuracy.
