This script includes a function `compare_one` that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns the variable with the largest value based on its data type. If the values are equal, it returns `None`. It keeps track of the number of tests run using the `total_tests` attribute. You can use this function to compare numbers of different types. 

Note that the script assumes that the values being compared are "real numbers" - eg. integers, floats, or strings that can be converted to floats (even if the string is without a decimal, like the string `"5"`). 

To use this script, add it to the code block in your markdown, and the code block will execute and test the function automatically.
