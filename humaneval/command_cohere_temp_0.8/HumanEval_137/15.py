The function compares two numbers, one of which could be a string representing a real number. The function first checks whether the types of the inputs are the same, and if they are not, it returns None. If the types are either both integers or both floats, it compares the values, returning the larger one and None if equal. If the types are strings, it compares the strings strictly alphabetically, considering the floating point as part of the number, and returns the larger string, or None if equal. 

This solution is concise and follows the requirements of the problem statement. 
The tests would look something like this:
```python
test_compare_one = '''
assert compare_one(1, 2.5) == 2.5
assert compare_one(1, "2,3") == "2,3"
assert compare_one("5,1", "6") == "6"
assert compare_one("1", 1) is None
assert compare_one(1, 1) is None
assert compare_one(1.0, 1) == 1
assert compare_one(1, 1.0) == 1.0
assert compare_one("1.0", 1) == "1.0"
assert compare_one("1", "1.0") == "1.0"
assert compare_one(1, "1.0") is None
'''
