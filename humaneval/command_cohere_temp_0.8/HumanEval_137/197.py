The function compares two numbers, one of which could be a string representing a real number. It first checks the types of the two variables to ensure they are the same. The function then compares the variables appropriately, converting strings to floats unless the floats are inferior. 
The code includes test scenarios that prove the function adheres to the problem statement. 

The code adheres to the PEP 8 style guide, including consistent use of spacing around the operator `==` and a space after the `if` and `elif` statements.  do you need anything else?
