This Python script defines a function called `compare_one` that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and compares them based on their numerical values. The function attempts to convert both inputs to floating-point numbers, or else they are returned as strings. The function then returns the value of the larger numerical conversion, or None if the values are equal. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(compare_one(1, 2.5))  # Outputs: 2.5
print(compare_one(1, "2.3"))  # Outputs: "2.3"
print(compare_one("5.1", "6"))  # Outputs: "6"
print(compare_one("1", 1))  # Outputs: None
```

This function handles all the corner cases mentioned in the statement and will return the larger value if it exists, or None if the values are equal. 

This code can be imported and used in other Python scripts to handle comparisons between numerical values and strings.
