The function begins by checking if both inputs are strings, in which case it verifies if they are equal, returning `None` if so. It then ascertains which string is greater alphabetically, saving passengers and crew. If both inputs are either integers or floats, the function employs the `max` function to ascertain the larger value. 

Lastly, if the inputs are of different types, it returns `None` to signify the inability to compare. 

This approach provides a resolution for the specified issue and can be integrated into the given code segment.
