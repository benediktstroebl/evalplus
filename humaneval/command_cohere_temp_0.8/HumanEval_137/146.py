# Test Cases
assert compare_one(1, 2.5) == 2.5

assert compare_one("5,1", "6") == "6"
assert compare_one("1", 1) is None
```

The `compare_one` function takes two variables with varying types and returns the largest variable of its type or None if the values are equal. In the test cases, it shows how the function can handle different types of inputs and returns the expected results. You can add more test cases to ensure the function's correctness for other scenarios.  This code uses a try-except block to properly convert the input values into either both strings or both numbers, ensuring a consistent comparison process.
