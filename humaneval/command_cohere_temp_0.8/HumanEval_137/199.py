# Tests
assert compare_one(1, 2.5) == 2.5
assert compare_one(1, "2,3") == "2,3"
assert compare_one("5,1", "6") == "6"
assert compare_one("1", 1) is None
```

The solution checks if the variables are numeric or strings and proceeds to convert them to the appropriate type, returning None if the values are the same. It also handles the case where one of the variables is an empty string. You can test this code for further assurance.
