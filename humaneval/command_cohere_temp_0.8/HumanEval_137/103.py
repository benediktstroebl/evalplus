The function compares two numbers, one of which could be a string representing a real number. It first checks whether the two objects are of the same type. If they are not, it returns the larger one if both types are numeric, or the result of type(x) if they are a string and a number. If the types are the same, it compares the values. None is returned if the values are equal, and the larger value is returned if the values are not equal. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(compare_one(1, 2.5))     # Output: 2.5
print(compare_one(1, "2,3"))   # Output: "2,3"
print(compare_one("5,1", "6")) # Output: "6"
print(compare_one("1", 1))     # Output: None
``` 

This should produce the desired outputs of `2.5`, `"2,3"`, `"6"`, and `None`, respectively, as outlined in the original problem statement.
