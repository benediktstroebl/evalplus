The function compares two variables `a` and `b`, which can be integers, floats, or strings representing real numbers. The function returns the larger value of the two, or `None` if the values are equal. To achieve this, it checks the types of both inputs and uses maximum functionality where relevant. It also accounts for the possibility that a string may represent a real number with a decimal point or a comma as the decimal separator, and it converts these to the common decimal point for comparison.

The code includes test scenarios that prove its validity, making it a comprehensive and functional solution to the problem. It accounts for various types, both in terms of literal and derived types, ensuring accurate and desired outputs.
