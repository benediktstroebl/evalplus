The function `compare_one` takes two parameters `a` and `b`, which should be of the same type (integer, float, or string). The function returns the largest value of the given input parameters. If the values are equal, it returns `None`. The `strip` method has been used to ignore the floating point part for comparison as mentioned in the note. 

This approach ensures that the largest value is correctly returned without regard to the specific format in which real numbers were represented, whether as integers, floats, or strings. 

This code solves the problem in a straightforward and easily understandable manner. 
Here is an example of how you can use the above function to test each possible case:
```python
>>> compare_one(1, 2.5)
2.5
>>> compare_one(1, "2,3")
"2,3"
>>> compare_one("5,1", "6")
"6"
>>> compare_one("1", 1)
None
>>> compare_one(1, 1)
None
``` 

The above code shows six different examples of how you can use the `compare_one` function to compare different types of numbers or strings.  You can use this to test your function and see if it is working as it should.
