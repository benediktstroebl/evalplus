```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """ For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n """
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and n // i >= i:
            return i
```

This Python script defines a function called `largest_divisor` taking a single argument `n`, where `n` is a positive integer. This function returns the largest integer divisor of `n` that is smaller than `n` itself. The script iterates through numbers from 1 to `n`, considering each number as a potential divisor. It checks if the number can divide `n` without leaving a remainder (i.e., `n % i == 0`) and if it's also larger or equal to the potential divisor itself (`n // i >= i`). The latter condition ensures that the potential divisor is indeed the largest possible one within the given range. The script returns the largest divisor found. 

The function docstring provides a brief explanation of what the function does, as well as a simple test case (`largest_divisor(15)`) that demonstrates its behavior for a specific input.
