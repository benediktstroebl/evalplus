```python
def largest_divisor(n):
    """ For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n """
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
```

This Python script defines a function called `largest_divisor` taking a single argument `n`, and aiming to identify the largest divisor of 'n' that is also smaller than `n` itself. It iterates through numbers from 1 to `n` using a `for` loop. During each iteration, the script checks if the current number can divide `n` evenly by assessing whether the remainder of `n` divided by this number (i.e., `n % i`) equals zero. If such a number is found, the function returns it, representing the largest divisor smaller than `n`. 

The script returns the solution through the `return` statement, which signifies the conclusion of the function, providing the outcome of the computation. 

To validate the functionality of the script, you can write a test case in markdown, as follows:
```
```python
>>> largest_divisor(15)
5
```
```

This test case demonstrates the anticipated behavior of the function where, for the input `15`, the function returns `5` as the largest divisor. 

Feel free to add more test cases to further validate the function's behavior for different input scenarios.  For example, you may want to test with inputs such as `7`, `25`, `36`, etc., to ensure the function handles different cases appropriately.
