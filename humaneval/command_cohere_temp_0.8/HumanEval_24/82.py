```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """ For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n """
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and n // i > i:
            return i
    return 1
```
The function iterates through numbers from 1 to n. If `n` is divisible by `i`, it checks if the divisor `i` is also the largest possible divisor, which would be `n // i`. If it is, it returns `i`. If not, it moves on to the next number in the iteration. As a final statement, if no divisor is found in the iteration, it returns 1.

Here is an example usage of the function with the accompanying test:
```python
def test_largest_divisor():
    """ Test the largest_divisor function """
    assert largest_divisor(15) == 5
    assert largest_divisor(8) == 2
    assert largest_divisor(27) == 9
    assert largest_divisor(100) == 10
    assert largest_divisor(121) == 11
    assert largest_divisor(16) == 8
    assert largest_divisor(7) == 1
``` 

This test suite contains multiple assertions that validate the behavior of the function against specific test cases. Each assertion checks that the function returns the expected output for a given input.  The expected output is enclosed in `assert`, and the actual output is computed by calling the function with the input value. If the expected and actual outputs are the same, the test passes. If not, it fails, thereby alerting the user to an unexpected behavior or bug in the function.  By executing this test suite, you can verify that the function behaves as expected across different inputs, assuring its reliability and accuracy.  This approach helps in systematically testing the function's correctness before deploying it in production or for any other purpose.  If all the assertions pass, the tester can be confident that the code behaves as expected.  However, if any assertion fails, it indicates a discrepancy between the expected and actual outputs, pointing to the possibility of a coding error or incorrect assumption.  This is a fundamental practice in software development, specifically unit testing, to ensure code quality, maintainability, and accuracy before it is used in more complex scenarios or interacts with other components.  This is also a step toward the broader practice of test-driven development (TDD), which involves writing tests before writing the actual code.  It helps to ensure that the code meets the specified requirements and can adapt to changing needs over time.  This comprehensive approach to testing is a cornerstone of software engineering best practices, as it helps in building robust, reliable, and scalable code.  By running the test suite and addressing any failures, developers can ensure that the code behaves as expected and is ready for deployment or further integration with other components.  This is a continuous process that thrives in an iterative and collaborative development environment, where coding, testing, and refreshing test suites are ongoing activities.  As the software evolves, the testing process becomes increasingly vital to ensure that changes or additions to the code do not introduce unintended side effects or regressions.  This is especially important as the codebase grows, as it becomes increasingly difficult to ascertain the impact of changes on downstream functionality.  Running the test suite regularly (e.g., before and after each change) ensures that any discrepancies are identified quickly and resolved, thus helping to keep the codebase stable and reliable.  This systematic approach to testing is essential for the function's robustness, usability, and flexibility, making it suitable for various scenarios and use cases.
