```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """ For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n """
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            j = n // i  # n // i gives the same value as math.gcd but is usually slower
            if j > i:
                return i
            if j < i:
                return j
    return 1  # If no divisors are found, return 1
```

The provided solution employs a for loop to iterate through all numbers from 1 to n. It determines if the number 'i' can divide `n` evenly, and if it can, it calculates the largest number smaller than `n` that evenly divides it. The loop is exited early if a larger divisor than the current 'i' is found. Finally, if no divisors are found, a default return value of 1 is set. 

Note that this solution has a time complexity of O(n) as it checks each element in the range `[1, n]` which could pose a challenge for large input values in terms of time and efficiency.
