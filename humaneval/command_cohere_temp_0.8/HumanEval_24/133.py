```python
def largest_divisor(n):
    """ For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n """
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
```
The function iterates through numbers from 1 to n. If the number at index i can divide n evenly (i.e. n is divisible by i), then that number is returned. The loop ends after the largest potential divisor, n, is reached. 

Let's expand on the reasoning for the problem:
In essence, the problem asks us to find the largest divisor of n that is less than n itself. A divisor is defined as a number that can evenly divide another number without leaving a remainder. For example, 4 is a divisor of 12 because 12 / 4 = 3, with no remainder.

To find the largest divisor that is less than n, it is efficient to start the search from the smallest potential divisor, which is 1, and incrementally move up until n is reached. At each step, the function checks if the current number i is a divisor of n. This is done using the modulo operator %, which returns the remainder of the division n / i. If the remainder is 0, it means that n is divisible by i, and i is therefore a divisor of n.

The function will return the first divisor it finds, as it is searching in ascending order, and the search stops at the largest potential divisor, n, Meeting the specifcation requirements of returning a divisor smaller than n, it is intentional that the function does not find and return all divisorrs smaller than n. 

The approach is both efficient and logical, allowing us to quickly find the desired answer with minimal computational effort.
