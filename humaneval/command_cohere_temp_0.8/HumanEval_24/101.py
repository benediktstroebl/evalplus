This Python script defines a function `largest_divisor(n)` that calculates the largest divisor of a given number `n`. It iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n`, finding candidates for divisors. It then returns the largest divisor found during this process, or 1 if no divisor is found (e.g., if the input `n` is a prime number). 

The script includes tests for the function, and it expects the output of the provided test cases to be 5, 4, 8, and 9, respectively, as stated in the problem statement. You can modify the test cases by changing the input values in the parentheses following `print` to test the function on different inputs.
