```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """ For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n """
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            j = n // i  # incumbent
            if j > i:  # to make sure i is not larger than the incumbent
                return i
            if j < i:  # to make sure i is not smaller than the incumbent
                return j
    return n  # return n if no dividers found
```

Let's walk through the code:
- The function largest_divisor takes a single argument n, where n is the number for which we want to find the largest divisor.
- We iterate through all numbers from 1 to n:
    - For each number i, we check if i is a divisor of n. If n divides i (n % i == 0), we update our 'incumbent' variable j to the value n // i. We have two cases:
        1. If j is greater than i, it means that i is not the largest divisor so far, so we continue the iteration. 
        2. If j is smaller than i, it means that i is the largest divisor so far, so we return i. 
- If we go through all numbers without finding a divisor, we return n, as there will be no larger number than n that divides n evenly. 
- The function returns the largest divisor of n that is smaller than n. 

The function should return the largest divisor for any given positive integer n. For example, it returns 5 for 15, and 3 for 12. 

This algorithm is efficient, as it uses a linear iteration (O(n)) to find the largest divisor, and has an extra check to make sure the fastest answer is returned (no bonus for finding slower divisors). 

To verify the correctness of the script, you can run the following test:
```python
def test_largest_divisor():
    assert largest_divisor(15) == 5
    assert largest_divisor(12) == 3
    assert largest_divisor(1) == 1
    assert largest_divisor(100) == 100
```

Testing with different inputs ensures that the function works correctly for all cases.
