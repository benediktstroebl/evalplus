```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """ For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n """
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
```
The function `largest_divisor(n)` takes a number `n` as input and iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n` using the range()` function. It checks if the current number `i` can divide `n` evenly by checking if `n% i == 0`. If it is, it returns `i` as the largest divisor. 

The script ensures that it comprehensively covers all potential divisor options for `n` by checking all numbers between 1 and `n`. As a result, it is able to determine the largest divisor that is less than `n`.  This approach proves efficient and elegant, avoiding the need for sophisticated mathematical reasoning.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```python
>> largest_divisor(15)
5
```
This will return the largest divisor of 15, which is 5. 

This approach is a simple yet effective way to find the largest divisor of a number.
