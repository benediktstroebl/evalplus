```python
def largest_divisor(n):
    """ Returns the largest divisor of n <= n """
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
```
The function iterates through numbers from 1 to n. If the number is divisible by n, it returns the largest number within this range. The loop terminates after n because a number larger than n cannot be a divisor of n.
