```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """ For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n """
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
```
The function iterates through numbers from 1 to n. If the number at index i can divide n evenly (i.e., n is divisible by i), then that number is returned. The loop ends after the largest divisor is found, so there is no need to go through all subsequent numbers.
