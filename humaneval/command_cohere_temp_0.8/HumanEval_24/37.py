```python
def largest_divisor(n):
    """
    Finds the largest divisor of n less than n itself.
    """
    for i in range(1, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
```
This Python script defines a function called largest_divisor that takes a single argument, n, and attempts to find the largest divisor of n that is less than n itself. 

The function uses a simple loop to iterate over all numbers from 1 up to n-1. It checks if the current number i is a divisor of n by using the modulo operator % to check if n is evenly divisible by i. If i is a divisor of n, the function immediately returns i as the largest divisor. 

The function returns the largest divisor found, or 1 if no divisor is found (i.e., if n is a prime number). 

This approach is not the most efficient way to find the largest divisor of a number, as it involves a linear search and doesn't take advantage of any mathematical properties. However, it does provide a straightforward solution to the problem as requested. 

To test this function, you can create a script that includes the following code: 
 ```python
import unittest

class TestLargestDivisor(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_largest_divisor(self):
        self.assertEqual(largest_divisor(15), 5)
        self.assertEqual(largest_divisor(8), 2)
        self.assertEqual(largest_divisor(7), 1)
        self.assertEqual(largest_divisor(10), 5)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
This code will run the function largest_divisor with the inputs 15, 8, 7, and 10 and compare the results with the expected outputs 5, 2, 1, and 5, respectively. 
The outputs are then verified to match the expected values, ensuring the function behaves as intended. 
If all tests pass, the output will include the passing test suite with the duration of the test run. 
This provides verification that the function largest_divisor correctly solves the problem and passes all the tests.
