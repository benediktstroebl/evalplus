```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """ For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n """
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
```
The function iterates through factors of `n` in the range of `1` to `n` and returns the maximum factor it finds. 
It is important to note that this method is not the most efficient approach for large `n` as it involves checking each number individually. However, for simplicity and understanding, it is a suitable method. 
If the intent is to find the largest divisor of `n` efficiently, bypassing the limitation of the given time complexity, alternative approaches may be considered, such as factoring `n` and utilizing the prime factorization.
