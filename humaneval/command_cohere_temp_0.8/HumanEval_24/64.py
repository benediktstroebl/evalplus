```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """ For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n """
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
```
The function `largest_divisor(n)` takes an integer n as input and iterates through all integers from 1 to n. During each iteration, it checks if i is a divisor of n using the modulo operator (%): if there exists an integer i such that n % i == 0, then i is a divisor of n. The function returns the largest divisor of n during each iteration, until n is satisfied. In the end, the largest divisor smaller than n is returned.

Here is an example output of the function:
```
largest_divisor(15)
5
```
The largest divisor of 15 is 5, which is also the largest number that can divide 15 without leaving a remainder.
