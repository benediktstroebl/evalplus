```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """ For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n """
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            j = n // i  # numerator
            k = i     # denominator
            m = j // k  # i is the largest divisor if j is the largest numerator and k is the largest denominator
            if m == i:
                return i
        else:
            continue
    return -1
```

The provided Python script solves the problem by iterating through all numbers from 1 to n and checking if n is divisible by any of them. When a divisor is found, the script further checks if the current divisor is the largest by comparing it with the current numerator and denominator. The largest divisor is returned if found, and -1 is returned if no divisor is found. 

This approach ensures that the largest divisor is found and returned, and it operates efficiently by taking advantage of the properties of divisibility. 

To further ensure the robustness of the script, additional tests could be added to validate the behavior of the function for edge cases and different input scenarios. For instance, testing with both even and odd inputs, very large numbers, and numbers with small prime factors can help ensure that the function handles various cases optimally.
