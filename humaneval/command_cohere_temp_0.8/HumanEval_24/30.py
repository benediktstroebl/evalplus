```python
def largest_divisor(n):
    """ For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n """
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
```
The function iterates through numbers from 1 to n. If the number is divisible by n, it returns the largest number within this range. 
If n is not divisible by any number in this range, the function returns 1, as per the specification of the problem. 
This code assumes the input is valid, i.e., an integer value for n. 
To ensure this, you could add a validation step at the beginning of the function, e.g., `if not isinstance(n, int): raise ValueError("Expected an integer")`. 
This modification will ensure the function handles invalid input gracefully. 
Feel free to adapt the function according to your needs.
