```python
def histogram(test):
    letter_count = {}
    for letter in test.lower():
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    return letter_count
```
The code defines a Python function `histogram` that takes a string `test` as input. It initializes an empty dictionary `letter_count` to count the occurrences of each lowercase letter in the input string. It iterates through each letter in the lowercase version of the input `test`. For each letter, it checks if the letter already exists in the `letter_count` dictionary using the `in` operator. If it does, the letter's count is incremented by 1; otherwise, a new entry is added to the dictionary with a count of 1. Finally, it returns the `letter_count` dictionary containing the results.
