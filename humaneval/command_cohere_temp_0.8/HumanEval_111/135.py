```python
def histogram(test):
    letter_count = {}
    for letter in test.lower():
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    return letter_count
```
The code defines a Python function `histogram` that takes a string `test` as input. Inside the function, it initializes an empty dictionary `letter_count` to store the letter counts. It then iterates through each character in the lowercased input string `test`. For each character, it checks if the character already exists as a key in the `letter_count` dictionary. If it does, the corresponding value is incremented; otherwise, a new entry with a count of 1 is added to the dictionary.

Finally, it returns the `letter_count` dictionary, which represents the frequency of each letter in the input string. The function handles cases where multiple letters have the same occurrence count and returns all such letters along with their counts.
