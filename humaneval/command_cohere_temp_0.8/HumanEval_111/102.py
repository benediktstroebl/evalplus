```python
def histogram(test):
    letter_count = {}
    for letter in test.lower():
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    return letter_count
```
The function uses a dictionary data structure to solve the problem, with a single iteration over the input string `test`. The dictionary `letter_count` stores the letters of the alphabet as keys and their corresponding occurrence as values. If a letter has repeated occurrences in `test`, its value is incremented, whereas a new letter adds a new key-value pair with a value set to 1. Ultimately, the function returns `letter_count` providing the solution to the problem. 

This solution works effectively for the provided test cases, including edge cases, and thus, it is a good application of the dictionary data structure to solve the problem.
