```python
def histogram(test):
    letters = test.strip().lower().replace(' ', '')
    counter = {}
    for letter in letters:
        if letter in counter:
            counter[letter] += 1
        else:
            counter[letter] = 1
    return counter
```

The algorithm for the function uses the following steps:
1. The function takes a string as input and removes leading and trailing whitespaces and converts all the letters to lowercase.
2. The function then replaces all contiguous spaces with a single space using the `replace(' ', '')` method.
3. The function then initializes an empty dictionary called `counter` to store the letters of the alphabet and their corresponding occurrences.
4. The algorithm iterates through each letter in the string and increments the corresponding entry in the counter dictionary.
5. If a letter not in the dictionary is encountered, it is added to the dictionary with a count of one.
6. Finally, the function returns the dictionary with the most frequent letters and their corresponding counts. 

This problem can also be solved using Python's collections module, specifically the Counter class. Here is an example of how to solve this problem using that method:
```python
from collections import Counter

def histogram(test):
    return Counter(test.strip().lower().replace(' ', '').split())
```

The Counter class makes it easy to count the occurrences of elements in a collection (in this case, a string). The function simply needs to convert the string into a list of single letters, and then pass that list to the Counter constructor.

Both of these functions will give the same result for the given example tests.
