```python
def histogram(test):
    letter_count = {}
    for letter in test.lower():
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    return letter_count
```
The code defines a Python function `histogram` that takes a string `test` as input. It initializes an empty dictionary `letter_count` to store the frequency of each letter. It then iterates through each character in the input string, converting it to lowercase using the `lower()` method. For each letter, it updates the count in the `letter_count` dictionary by incrementing its value if the letter is already present, or initializing it with a value of 1 if it's encountered for the first time. Finally, it returns the `letter_count` dictionary containing the frequency of each letter in the input string.
