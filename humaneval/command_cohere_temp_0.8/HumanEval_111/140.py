```python
def histogram(test):
    letter_count = {}
    for letter in test.lower():
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    return letter_count
```
The code defines a Python function `histogram` that takes a string `test` as input. It initializes an empty dictionary `letter_count` to store the frequency of each letter. It then iterates through each character in the input string, converting it to lowercase using the `lower()` method. For each letter, it checks if the letter already exists in the `letter_count` dictionary using the `in` operator. If it does, the letter's count is incremented by 1; otherwise, a new entry is created in the dictionary with the letter assigned a count of 1. Finally, the function returns the `letter_count` dictionary containing the frequency of each letter in the input string.
