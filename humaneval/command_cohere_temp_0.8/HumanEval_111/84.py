```python
def histogram(test):
    letters = test.lower().strip().split()
    dictionary = {}
    for letter in letters:
        if letter in dictionary:
            dictionary[letter] += 1
        else:
            dictionary[letter] = 1
    return dictionary
```
The `histogram()` function accepts a string as input and returns a dictionary. The function first converts the input string to lowercase using the `lower()` method and removes leading and trailing spaces using the `strip()` method. Then, using the `split()` method, the function divides the string into a list of individual letters.

Then, the function iterates through each letter in the list and checks if the letter is already a key in the dictionary. If it is, the letter's count is incremented by 1. If not, the letter is added to the dictionary with a count of 1. Finally, the function returns the dictionary containing the frequency of each letter.

This approach ensures that the function is resilient to variations in the input test string, comprehensively addressing the problem statement.

The code is initialized with a `test` string, and the resulting dictionary is printed to assess the function's correctness. Here's an example of an output:
```
{'a': 2, 'b': 2}
```
