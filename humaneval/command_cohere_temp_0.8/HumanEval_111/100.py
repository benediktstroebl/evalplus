```python
def histogram(test):
    letter_count = {}
    
    for letter in test.lower():
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    
    return letter_count
```

The code works by initially creating a dictionary called `letter_count`, where the keys are English lowercase letters and the values are the corresponding counts. The `for` loop then iterates over each letter in the test string, converting the letter to lowercase to ensure consistency. It checks if the letter is already a key in the `letter_count` dictionary using the `in` operator. If it is, the corresponding count is incremented; otherwise, a new entry is created with a count of 1.

This accurately and efficiently solves the problem, as it returns a dictionary that contains letters as keys and their respective counts as values, or an empty dictionary if the input string is empty.
