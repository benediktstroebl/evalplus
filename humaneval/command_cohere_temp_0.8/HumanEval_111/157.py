```python
def histogram(test):
    letter_count = {}
    for letter in test.lower():
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    return letter_count
```
The `histogram()` function takes a string as input and returns a dictionary of the letters in the string and their corresponding counts. 
The dictionary is initialized with an empty dictionary `letter_count`, and then the `for` loop iterates through every letter in the inputted string, lowers each letter to ensure consistency, and increments the count of the letter within the dictionary. If the letter does not exist in the dictionary, it is added with a count of 1.

This code can be improved upon by using Python's `Counter` class, which is meant to handle exactly such chores, reducing the need for manual loops and dictions. 

```python
from collections import Counter

def histogram(test):
    return Counter(test.lower())
``` 

Would you like me to walk you through the solution process, or would you like to understand more about the `Counter` class and its applications? Feel free to ask, and I'll be happy to help! If you have any tests you'd like to run for this function, please provide them so that we can further verify the functionality.
