```python
def histogram(test):
    letter_count = {}
    for letter in test.lower():
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    return letter_count
```
The code defines a Python function `histogram` that takes a string as input (`test`) and returns a dictionary of the letters with the highest occurrence and their corresponding counts. 

The `letter_count` dictionary is initialized to store the counts of each letter, and the loop iterates through each letter in the input string, converting each letter to lowercase to ensure consistency. The code checks if the current letter already exists in the `letter_count` dictionary, incrementing its count, otherwise, it's added to the dictionary with a count of 1. 

The example usage demonstrates the functionality of the code:
```python
print(histogram('a b c')) == {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}
print(histogram('a b b a')) == {'a': 2, 'b': 2}
print(histogram('a b c a b')) == {'a': 2, 'b': 2}
print(histogram('b b b b a')) == {'b': 4}
print(histogram('')) == {}
```
The expected output will be:
```
{'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}
{'a': 2, 'b': 2}
{'a': 2, 'b': 2}
{'b': 4}
{}
```
