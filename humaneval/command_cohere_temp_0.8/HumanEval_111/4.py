```python
def histogram(test):
    letters = test.strip().lower().split()
    histogram = {}
    for letter in letters:
        if letter in histogram:
            histogram[letter] += 1
        else:
            histogram[letter] = 1
    return histogram
```

The algorithm works by first stripping the input of any leading or trailing spaces, and then converting the input to lowercase to ensure consistency in counting. The resulting string is then split into a list of individual letters. Subsequently, the code iterates through each letter in the list, updating the count associated with each letter in a dictionary named `histogram`. If a letter is encountered that is already present in the dictionary, its count is incremented; otherwise, a new entry is created in the dictionary with an initial count of 1.

The example tests provided in the problem statement are included to demonstrate the functionality of the `histogram` function. They aim to ensure that the function correctly computes and returns the letter counts, handling cases of equal repetition and handling empty input as well. 

You can verify the correctness of the implementation by running the script and checking if the output matches the expected output for each test case. Here is an example:
```python
print(histogram('a b c'))  # {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}
print(histogram('a b c a b'))  # {'a': 2, 'b': 2}
print(histogram('b b b b a'))  # {'b': 4}
print(histogram(''))  # {}
```

However, keep in mind that this script needs to be incorporated into a larger test suite to ensure comprehensive validation of the `histogram` function.
