```python
def histogram(test):
    letter_count = {}
    for letter in test.lower():
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    return letter_count
```
The code defines a Python function `histogram` that takes a string as input and returns a dictionary of the letters with the highest occurrence and their corresponding counts. To do this, it initializes an empty dictionary, `letter_count`, and loops through each letter in the input string, converting each letter to lowercase. For each letter, it checks if the letter already exists in the `letter_count` dictionary. If it does, the letter's count is incremented; otherwise, it's added to the dictionary with a count of 1. After processing all letters, the dictionary is returned, containing the most repeated letters and their counts.
