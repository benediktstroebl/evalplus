```python
def histogram(test):
    letter_count = {}
    for letter in test.lower():
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    return letter_count
```
The `histogram()` function takes a string as input and returns a dictionary of the letters in the string and their corresponding counts. 

Let's break down the solution into steps:
1. The function `histogram()` takes a string as input and initializes an empty dictionary called `letter_count`.
2. The `for` loop iterates over each letter in the input string. If the letter is already in the `letter_count` dictionary, its count is incremented. If the letter is not in the dictionary, it's added with a count of 1.
3. The function returns the `letter_count` dictionary containing the most frequent letters and their counts.

This solution is straightforward and performs well for small to medium-sized inputs. However, keeping track of letter counts in a dictionary has an O(n) space complexity, which may become a consideration for large inputs. 

The solution provided assumes the input is a string of lowercase letters, as described in the problem statement. If the input may contain an uppercase letter or other characters, the code can be enhanced with an additional check to validate the character before updating the dictionary. 

The unit tests can be added to ensure the robustness of the solution. Despite this, the core logic of the function remains the same, iterating over the input and updating the dictionary accordingly.
