```python
def histogram(test):
    letters = test.strip().lower().replace(' ', '')
    if not letters:
        return {}
    dictLetters = {}
    for letter in letters:
        if letter in dictLetters:
            dictLetters[letter] += 1
        else:
            dictLetters[letter] = 1
    return dictLetters
```
The provided solution uses Python string methods to manipulate the input string into a more usable format. The `strip()` method is used to remove any leading or trailing white space from the input. The `lower()` method converts the entire string to lowercase, making it consistent and case-insensitive. The `replace()` method replaces any spaces in the string with the empty character, allowing us to split the string into individual letters without having to deal with spaces.

After converting the input, the solution checks if the resulting `letters` variable is empty. If true, it returns an empty dictionary; otherwise, it iterates through each letter and counts its occurrences by incrementing the count if the letter is already in the dictionary or adding a new entry with a count of 1 if it is not. Finally, the function returns the resulting dictionary of letters occurring in the input.

This solution focuses on simplicity and readability, ensuring that the code is easily understandable and maintainable, which is particularly important in practical coding scenarios where code performance is not the only concern.
