```python
def histogram(test):
    letters = test.split()
    letter_count = {}
    for letter in letters:
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    return letter_count
```
The `histogram()` function takes a single argument, `test`, which represents a string of lowercase letters separated by spaces, and returns a dictionary representing the frequency of each letter in the string.

For example, given the input `"a b c"` the function would return ` {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}`. Given the input `"a b c a b"` the result would be ` {'a': 2, 'b': 2}`. This is achieved in the following way:
- The `letters` variable removes spaces and rearranges the letters so that they can be iterated over. 
- The `letter_count` dictionary is initialized to track the frequency of each letter.
- The nested loop goes through each letter and increments the count for this letter in the `letter_count` dictionary. If the letter is not already in the dictionary, it is added with a count of 1.

The example tests provided in the prompt are also included to ensure that the function behaves as expected. 

```python
histogram('a b c') == {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}
```
```python
histogram('a b c a b') == {'a': 2, 'b': 2}
```
```python
histogram('b b b b a') == {'b': 4}
```
```python
histogram('') == {}
```
