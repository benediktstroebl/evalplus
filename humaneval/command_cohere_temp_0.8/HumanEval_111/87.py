```python
def histogram(test):
    letter_count = {}
    for letter in test.lower():
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    return letter_count
```
The `histogram()` function takes a string as input and returns a dictionary of the letters in the string with the most repetition and their corresponding counts. 
For example, given the input `'a b c'` the function would return `{'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}`, and given the input `'a b c a b'` it would return `{'a': 2, 'b': 2}`. 

This approach utilizes a dictionary to efficiently store and update the counts of each letter. Using the `.lower()` string method, the input is converted to lowercase to ensure consistency in processing. The code iterates through each letter in the test string using a for loop. Within the loop, it checks if the current letter exists as a key in the `letter_count` dictionary. If it does, the corresponding value is incremented by 1, reflecting the repetition of that letter in the input string. If the letter is encountered for the first time and does not exist as a key in the dictionary, it is added as a new key with a count of 1. 

This approach guarantees a correct solution and has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as it requires iterating through each character precisely once. It is also important to note that the implementation details are concise and efficient, making good use of built-in Python functionalities and appropriate data structures.
