```python
def histogram(test):
    letter_count = {}
    
    for letter in test.lower():
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    
    return letter_count
```
The `histogram()` function takes a string as input and returns a dictionary of the letters in the string with the most repetition and their corresponding counts. 
For example, `histogram('a b c') == {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}`

This is a simple yet efficient solution that uses a dictionary to keep track of the counts of each letter. 

The `letter_count` dictionary is initialized to store the counts of each letter in the input string. The `for` loop iterates over each letter in the input string, and the `if` statement checks if the letter is already in the `letter_count` dictionary. If it is, the letter's count is incremented; otherwise, a new entry is created in the dictionary with the letter as the key and a count of 1.

This solution does not require any additional libraries and can be run directly in Python.  It provides a clear and concise way to solve the problem and can be easily modified to handle different input scenarios.
