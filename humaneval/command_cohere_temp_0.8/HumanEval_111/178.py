```python
def histogram(test):
    letters = test.lower().strip().split()
    dictionary = {}
    for letter in letters:
        if letter in dictionary:
            dictionary[letter] += 1
        else:
            dictionary[letter] = 1
    return dictionary
```
The function processes the test string by converting it to lowercase and stripping any leading and trailing spaces. It then uses the split method to break the string into a list of/******/ individual letters. Looping over the list, the code increments the occurrence count of each letter in the dictionary. If a letter is encountered for the first time, it's added to the dictionary with a count of 1.

The code structure allows for a single pass through the letter list, making it efficient. Additionally, the use of the dictionary ensures that the processing time increases only linearly with the size of the input test string, resulting in a very efficient solution.
