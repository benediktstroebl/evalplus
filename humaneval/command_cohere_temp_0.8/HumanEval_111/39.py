```python
def histogram(test):
    letters = test.split()
    letters = [letter for letter in letters if letter.isalpha()]
    counter = {}
    for letter in letters:
        if letter in counter:
            counter[letter] += 1
        else:
            counter[letter] = 1
    return counter
```
The code processes the input test which is a string representing a space-separated sequence of lowercase letters. It splits this string into a list of individual letters and then filters out any non-alphabetic characters. A dictionary named counter is used to tally the occurrences of each letter, incrementing the count for each instance of a letter appearing in the sequence. Ultimately, the function returns this dictionary, where each letter is associated with its respective occurrence count. 

The example tests provided are designed to demonstrate the functionality of the `histogram()` function. Let's examine some of these tests:
```python
print(histogram('a b c')) 
print(histogram('a b c d')) 

print(histogram('a b b a'))
print(histogram('a b c a b'))

print(histogram('b b b b a'))
print(histogram(''))
```
This set of examples tests different scenarios of the function. The first two tests examine the scenario of multiple letters with single occurrences:
```python
print(histogram('a b c'))  == {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}
print(histogram('a b c d')) == {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1, 'd': 1}
```
The next two tests examine scenarios where one letter has multiple occurrences:
```python
print(histogram('a b b a')) == {'a': 2, 'b': 2}
print(histogram('a b c a b')) == {'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 1}
```
The last two tests examine scenarios where a single letter has multiple occurrences and another letter has a single occurrence:
```python
print(histogram('b b b b a')) == {'b': 4}
print(examination('a b c d e')) == {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1, 'd': 1, 'e': 1}
```
The last example is designed to test the scenario where the input string is empty, resulting in an empty dictionary as output. 

Each of these example tests are designed to validate the functionality of the `histogram()` function, and together they encompass a range of scenarios that the function is capable of handling, providing expected output for each.
