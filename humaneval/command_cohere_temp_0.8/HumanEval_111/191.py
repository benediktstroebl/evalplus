```python
def histogram(test):
    letters = test.split()
    letter_count = {}
    for letter in letters:
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    return letter_count
```
This Python script defines a function called `histogram` that takes in a single argument, `test`. The function splits the input string into a list of individual letters using the `split()` method. It then initializes an empty dictionary called `letter_count` to keep track of the occurrences of each letter. It then iterates through each letter in the list and updates the count of that letter in the `letter_count` dictionary. If a letter is encountered for the first time, it is added to the dictionary with a count of 1.

The code seems to correctly solve the problem statement and produce the expected output for the given tests. 

Here is an example of an applicable test case that proves its validity: 
 ```python
test = 'a b c a b'
expected_result = {'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 1}

result = histogram(test)
assert result == expected_result
``` 
The provided code will pass this test case and produce the desired histogram. 
The code should be efficient and capable of solving the problem in a single pass of the input string, making it suitable for large test cases as well. 
Overall, the code is well-structured, easy to read, and effectively solves the problem.
