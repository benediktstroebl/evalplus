```python
def histogram(test):
    letter_count = {}
    for letter in test.lower():
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    return letter_count
```
The `histogram()` function takes a string as input and returns a dictionary of the letters in the string with the most repetition and their corresponding counts. 
For example, given the input `'a b c'` the output would be `{'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}`, and for the input `'a b c a b'` the output would be `{'a': 2, 'b': 2}`. 

This approach uses a dictionary to store the counts as it is efficient to add items and the keys are automatically ordered.
