```python
def histogram(test):
    letters = test.split()
    histogram = {}
    for letter in letters:
        if letter in histogram:
            histogram[letter] += 1
        else:
            histogram[letter] = 1
    return histogram
```
The code defines a function `histogram` that accepts a string as input. The function first splits the string into individual letters based on space separation. It then initializes an empty dictionary `histogram` to store the results. It iterates over each letter and checks if the letter is already a key in the `histogram` dictionary. If it is, the corresponding value is incremented, otherwise, the letter is added to the dictionary with a value of 1. Finally, the dictionary containing the results is returned. 

This algorithm solves the problem by operating on only one letter at a time and so reduces the complexity of the problem from O(n * m) to O(n), where 'n' is the length of the input string and 'm' is the total number of possible letters. This is a significant improvement in terms of efficiency. 

The problem is a basic example of the kind of challenges that are suitable for primary and middle school students who are learning to code and developing skills in algorithmic thinking. It's also a demonstration of how coding can be applied to solve everyday problems in a systematic way. 

The code can be further enhanced to be more efficient if the global dictionary is converted to a list for faster iterations. Also, the input string is space-separated, so the split method is used which adds an overhead. If we assume that the input will only contain letters and not spaces, a simpler approach can be to use a for loop to iterate over the characters in the string directly. 

```python
def histogram(test):
    letters = []
    for letter in test:
        if letter in letters:
            letters.count(letter)
        else:
            letters.append(letter)
    return letters
``` 
In the above code, we are omitting the use of the dictionary and instead using a list `letters` to keep track of the most frequent letters. We use the `count` method to increment the occurrence of a letter if it is already present in the list or we append the letter if it's not. This has a time complexity of O(n) since we are looping over the input string once only, instead of splitting it first. Gadgets like the split method are ideal for handling space-separated data, especially when the data might have multiple spaces, and provide a simple and elegant solution for such cases.
