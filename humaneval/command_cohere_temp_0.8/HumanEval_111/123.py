```python
def histogram(test):
    letters = test.lower().strip().split()
    letter_count = {}
    for letter in letters:
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    return letter_count
```
This Python script defines a function called `histogram` that takes in a single argument, `test`. The function converts the input test to lowercase, removes leading and trailing spaces, and splits it into a list of individual letters. It then initializes a dictionary, `letter_count`, to keep track of the count of each letter. 

The script then iterates through each letter in the list of letters, and updates the `letter_count` dictionary by incrementing the count of the respective letter. If a letter is encountered for the first time, it is added to the dictionary with a count of 1.

The function returns the `letter_count` dictionary, which provides the frequency of each letter in the input test. 

The returned dictionary is structured in a way that provides the letter with the most repetition and its corresponding count. If several letters have the same occurrence, the dictionary will contain all of them.
