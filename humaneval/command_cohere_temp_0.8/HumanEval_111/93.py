```python
def histogram(test):
    letter_count = {}
    for letter in test.lower():
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    return letter_count
```
The code defines a Python function `histogram` that takes a string `test` as input. It initializes an empty dictionary `letter_count` to count the occurrences of each letter in the input string. It then iterates through each letter in the lowercase version of the input string using a for loop. For each letter, it checks if the letter is already a key in the `letter_count` dictionary. If it is, the corresponding value is incremented; otherwise, a new entry is created in the dictionary with the letter as the key and a value of 1. Finally, the function returns the `letter_count` dictionary containing the results.
