```python
def histogram(test):
    letter_count = {}
    for letter in test.lower():
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    return letter_count
```
The `histogram()` function takes a string as input and returns a dictionary of the letters in the string with the most repetition and their corresponding counts. 
For example, if we use the function with the input `'a b c'` , the output would be `{'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}'`.
If multiple letters have the highest occurrence, the function will return all of them. 

This approach uses a dictionary to efficiently store and retrieve letter counts. The dictionary's keys are the unique letters in the input string, and the values are the corresponding occurrence counts. By iterating through the input string, the code populates the dictionary without the need for explicit sorting or complex data structures. The resulting dictionary provides a concise solution to the problem statement.
