```python
def histogram(test):
    letters = test.split()
    count = {}
    for letter in letters:
        if letter in count:
            count[letter] += 1
        else:
            count[letter] = 1
    return count
```
The function splits the input test string into a list of letters and then loops through this list, tracking the repetition of each letter in a dictionary called 'count'. If a letter is encountered for the first time, it's added to the dictionary with a count of 1. If the letter is already in the dictionary, its count is incremented. 

This solution ranks among the more efficient ones, with a time complexity of O(n), where 'n' is the length of the input string, as it takes linear time to walk through the string and process its letters.

The given problem is a good fit for the histogram method, which is intuitive and offers a clear and efficient solution.
