```python
def histogram(test):
    letter_count = {}
    
    for letter in test.lower():
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    
    return letter_count
```

The function creates a dictionary, letter_count, to keep track of the count of each letter in the string. It iterates through each letter in the string and increments its count in the dictionary. If the letter does not exist in the dictionary, it is added with a count of one. Finally, the function returns the dictionary with the letter and its corresponding count. 

The expected output for the provided examples in the prompt corresponds to the following:
```
{'a': 2, 'b': 2}
{'b': 4, 'a': 2}
{'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}
{}
```

This solution offers a straightforward way to solve the problem, and it's highly efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
