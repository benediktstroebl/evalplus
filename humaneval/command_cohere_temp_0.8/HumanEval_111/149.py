```python
def histogram(test):
    letters = test.strip().lower().split()
    histogram = {}
    for letter in letters:
        if letter in histogram:
            histogram[letter] += 1
        else:
            histogram[letter] = 1
    return histogram
```
The function uses a dictionary to store the letters of the alphabet and their corresponding counts. The function first strips away leading and trailing spaces from the input test string. It then converts the string to lowercase to ensure consistency in counting repetitions. The process then splits the string into separate letters using the split() method.

It then initializes an empty dictionary histogram to store the results. It iterates through each letter in the split string, and increments the count of the letter in the histogram dictionary. Using the dictionary's default initial value of 1 for any letter not already contained in the dictionary, it ensures that each letter with an occurrence is captured in the resulting dictionary. Finally, the function returns the histogram dictionary with the results. 

This approach ensures the algorithm satisfies the given problem statement's tests.
