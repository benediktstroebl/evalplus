```python
def histogram(test):
    letters = test.strip().lower().replace(' ', '')
    counter = {}
    for letter in letters:
        if letter in counter:
            counter[letter] += 1
        else:
            counter[letter] = 1
    return counter
```

This function processes the test string by stripping any leading or trailing whitespace and converting the letters to lowercase. It then uses a for loop to iterate through each letter in the string, incrementing its count in the `counter` dictionary. If the letter is already in the dictionary, its count is incremented; otherwise, it's added to the dictionary with a count of 1. 

The function returns the `counter` dictionary containing the letter counts. 

This approach ensures that the function is self-contained and can be easily understood and maintained. Let me know if you would like any further refinements or additional explanations.
