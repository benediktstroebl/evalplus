```python
def histogram(test):
    letter_count = {}
    for letter in test.lower():
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    return letter_count
```
The `histogram()` function takes a string as input and returns a dictionary of the letters in the string with the most repetition and their corresponding counts. 
For example, given the input `'a b c'` the output would be `{'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}'`.
Given the input `'a b c a b'` the output would be `{'a': 2, 'b': 2}'`.
This is because both 'a' and 'b' appear twice in the string, whereas 'c' only appears once.

The algorithm works by first turning the input string into a lowercase string and then iterating through it letter by # letter.
For each letter, we check if it is already in our dictionary and increment its count.
If it is not in our dictionary, we create a new key-value pair with a count of 1.

This algorithm is quite efficient because the complexity of inserting a letter into the dictionary only depends on the number of letters already in the dictionary, which is linear.
Furthermore, the algorithm iterates over the characters only once, so there is no additional complexity.
