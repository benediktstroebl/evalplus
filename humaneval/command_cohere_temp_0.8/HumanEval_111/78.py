```python
def histogram(test):
    letter_count = {}
    for letter in test.lower():
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    return letter_count
```
The function creates a dictionary called `letter_count`. It iterates through the lowercase letters of the test string, and for each letter, it increments its count in the dictionary. If the letter is not already in the dictionary, it is added with a count of 1. Finally, the function returns the dictionary with the most repeated letters and their respective counts. 

This approach is simple, robust, and computationally efficient. It linearly processes each character once, ensuring that the time complexity remains constant, regardless of the input size.
