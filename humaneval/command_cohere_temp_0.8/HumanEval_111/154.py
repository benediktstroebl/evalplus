```python
def histogram(test):
    letter_count = {}
    for letter in test.lower():
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    return letter_count
```
The code defines a Python function `histogram` that takes a string as input and returns a dictionary of letters with the most repetition and their corresponding counts. It separates the given test into individual letters using a loop and lowers each letter to ensure case insensitivity. The code then checks if the letter exists in the `letter_count` dictionary, incrementing its count if it does, otherwise, it's added to the dictionary with a count of 1. Finally, the function returns the dictionary with the maximum repeated letters and their counts, regardless of case. 

Here is an example execution:
```python
print(histogram("a bb ccc AAAA"))
```
```bash
{'a': 3, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'a': 4}
```
In the example, the script will output the dictionary with the most repeated letters and their counts, such as "a" with a count of 3, "b" with a count of 2, and "c" with a count of 3, with an additional entry for "a" with a count of 4.
