```python
def histogram(test):
    letter_count = {}
    
    for letter in test.lower():
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    
    return letter_count
```
The `histogram()` function takes a string as input and returns a dictionary of the letters in the string with the most repetition and their corresponding counts. 
For example, `histogram('a b c') == {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}`

This approach is straightforward and brute forces the problem by iterating through each letter in the string and incrementing the count if the letter is already in the dictionary, or creating a new entry with a count of 1 if it isn't. This strategy is not optimized and has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested for loop.
