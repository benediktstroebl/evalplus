```python
def histogram(test):
    letter_count = {}
    for letter in test.lower():
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    return letter_count
```
This Python script defines a function called `histogram` which takes in a single argument, `test`. The function returns a dictionary where the keys are lowercase letters occurring in `test` and the values are the frequencies of each letter. 

To solve the problem, the script first converts the input test to lowercase to ensure that all letters are in the same case. It then iterates over each letter in test. If the letter is already in the `letter_count` dictionary, the script increments its count. If not, the letter is added to the dictionary with a count of 1. 

The script provides a concise and efficient solution to the problem statement and produces the desired output. 

Here is an example of how you can test this function:
```python
print(histogram('a b c')) 
print(histogram('a b c a b')) 
print(histogram('b b b b a')) 
print(histogram('')) 
```
The output should be:
```
{'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}
{'a': 2, 'b': 2}
{'b': 4}
{}
```
