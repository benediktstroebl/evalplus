```python
def histogram(test):
    letter_count = {}
    for letter in test.lower():
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    return letter_count
```
This Python script defines a function called `histogram` that takes in a single argument, `test`. The function returns a dictionary where the keys are lowercase letters occurring in `test` and the values are the frequencies of each letter. 

To solve the problem, the script initializes an empty dictionary, `letter_count`, to store the letter counts. It then iterates over each character in the `test` string, converting each character to lowercase to ensure the counting process is case-insensitive. The current letter is then checked if it is present in the `letter_count` dictionary; if it is, the count for that letter is incremented, otherwise, a new entry is created with a count of 1. 

The script provides the correct output for the given examples in the original prompt and returns a dictionary representing the letter counts. 

This solution is efficient and uses regular Python objects and methods suitable for solving this problem.
