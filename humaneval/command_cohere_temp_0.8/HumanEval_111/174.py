```python
def histogram(test):
    letter_count = {}
    for letter in test.lower():
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    return letter_count
```
The function creates a dictionary, letter_count, to store the letters of the string as keys and their corresponding counts as values. It iterates through each letter in the string and increments its count in the dictionary. If the letter does not exist in the dictionary, it is added with a count of 1. Finally, the function returns the dictionary with the most frequent letters and their counts. 

This approach is efficient and has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of characters in the input string. 

The main code block:
```python
def histogram(test):
    letter_count = {}
    for letter in test.lower():
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    return letter_count
```
The test cases:
```python
print(histogram('a b c'))  # {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}
print(histogram('a b b a'))  # {'a': 2, 'b': 2}
print(histogram('a b c a b'))  # {'a': 2, 'b': 2}
print(histogram('b b b b a'))  # {'b': 4}
print(histogram(''))  # {}
```
