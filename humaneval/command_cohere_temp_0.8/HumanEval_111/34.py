```python
def histogram(test):
    letter_count = {}
    
    for letter in test.lower():
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    
    return letter_count
```

The `histogram()` function takes a string as input and returns a dictionary of the letters in the string and their corresponding counts. Let's break down the solution:
1. The `letter_count` dictionary is used to keep track of the occurrences of each letter.
2. Each letter in the input string is converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method to ensure case insensitivity.
3. The `for` loop iterates through each letter in the converted string.
4. For each letter, it checks if the letter already exists in the `letter_count` dictionary using the `in` operator. If it does, the occurrence count is incremented by 1. If it doesn't, it's added to the dictionary with a count of 1.
5. After processing all letters, the dictionary containing the letter and its count is returned.

The resulting dictionary represents the histogram of the most frequent letters (and their counts) in the input string.
