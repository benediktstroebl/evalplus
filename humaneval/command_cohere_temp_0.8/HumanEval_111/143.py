```python
def histogram(test):
    letter_count = {}
    for letter in test.lower():
        if letter in letter_count:
            letter_count[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_count[letter] = 1
    return letter_count
```
This Python script defines a function called `histogram` which takes in a single argument, `test`. The function returns a dictionary of the letters in the string `test` with the most repetition and their corresponding counts. For example, if the input test is `aa ab ac`, the output dictionary is `{'a': 3, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}`. If several letters have the same occurrence, the function will return all of them. 

The example usage is provided in the docstring of the function for clarity. The function operates by first creating an empty dictionary, `letter_count`, which will be used to store the counts of each letter. The `for` loop iterates over each letter in the `test` string, converts each letter to lowercase to ensure uniformity, and updates the count of the corresponding letter in the `letter_count` dictionary. If the letter is encountered for the first time, it is added to the dictionary with a count of 1. If the letter is already in the dictionary, the count is incremented by 1. Finally, the dictionary is returned with the maximum repetition counts for each letter.
