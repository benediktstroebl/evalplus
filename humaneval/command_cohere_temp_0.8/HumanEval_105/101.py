```python
def by_length(arr):
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr)[::-1]
    transf_map = {'1': 'One', '2': 'Two', '3': 'Three', '4': 'Four', 
                  '5': 'Five', '6': 'Six', '7': 'Seven', '8': 'Eight', '9': 'Nine'}
    result = [transf_map[str(x)] for x in sorted_arr if x >= 1 and x <= 9]
    return result if result else []
```

The provided Python code defines a function `by_length` that takes an array as input and performs actions based on the given problem statement.

The function first sorts the array in ascending order, and then reverses the sorted array using slicing. This results in an array containing the digits 1 to 9 in reverse order.

Next, the function creates a translation map to convert these digits into their respective words ('One', 'Two', etc.). The digits in the reversed array are then converted to their word representations in the 'result' array.

Finally, the function returns the 'result' array, but if the input array is empty, it returns an empty array, and if there are any numbers outside the range of 1 to 9, they are ignored from the final result. 

The overall purpose of the code is to sort and transform an input array of integers between 1 and 9, and handle edge cases where the input array is empty or contains numbers outside this range.
