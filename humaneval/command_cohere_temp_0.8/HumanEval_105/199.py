Here's a Python script that implements the `by_length` function:
```python
def by_length(arr):
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr, key = lambda x: 1 if x >= 1 and x <= 9 else float('inf'))
    reverse_sorted_arr = sorted(sorted_arr, reverse=True)
    result = []
    for num in reverse_sorted_arr:
      if str(num).isdigit():
        result.append(dict[num]) 
    return result
```
The `by_length` function sorts the array based on digits from 1 to 9, excluding any numbers outside that range. The resulting sorted array is then reversed and each digit is replaced by its corresponding name. The function returns the list of names in the desired order. Let's break down the code step by step:
1. `sorted_arr = sorted(arr, key = lambda x: 1 if x >= 1 and x <= 9 else float('inf'))`: This line sorts the input array `arr` using the `sorted` function. The `key` argument is a function that defines the sorting order. In this case, the lambda function `lambda x: 1 if x >= 1 and x <= 9 else float('inf')` is used. It checks if a number is between 1 and 9 (inclusive), and assigns the value 1 to sort it before other numbers. Numbers outside this range are assigned a very large value (`float('inf')`) to be sorted last. This results in the array being sorted with numbers 1 to 9 first, followed by any other numbers.
2. `reverse_sorted_arr = sorted(sorted_arr, reverse=True)`: This line further sorts the `sorted_arr` using the `sorted` function with `reverse=True` to obtain the reverse sorted array. 
3. `result = []`: Initializes an empty list named `result` to store the output.
4. `for num in reverse_sorted_arr:`: Iterates through each number in the `reverse_sorted_arr`.
5. `if str(num).isdigit():`: Checks if the number is a digit, and if so, appends the corresponding dictionary key (digit to word) to the `result` list. 
6. `return result`: Returns the resulting list of words in the desired order. 

This code ensures that numbers outside the range 1 to 9 are excluded and any consecutive duplicates are grouped and replaced correctly. It also handles the edge case where the input array is empty or contains only numbers outside the range.
