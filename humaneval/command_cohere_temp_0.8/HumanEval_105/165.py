```python
def by_length(arr):
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr)
    filtered_digits = [num for num in sorted_arr if 1 <= num <= 9]
    reversed_digits = filtered_digits[::-1]
    names = ["One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine"]
    return [names[i] for i in reversed_digits]

# Tests
arr = [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]
expected = ["Eight", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "Two", "One", "One"]
assert by_length(arr) == expected

arr = []
assert by_length(arr) == []

arr = [1, -1 , 55]
expected = ["One"]
assert by_length(arr) == expected
``` 

This code solves the problem statement in the following steps:
1. Sort the digits that are between 1 and 9 inclusive. 
2. Reverse the resulting array.
3. Replace each digit by its corresponding name. 

The script includes tests that check different scenarios to verify the function's correctness. You can add these tests to your test suite to ensure the function behaves as expected. In the tests, the `assert` statements compare the output of the `by_length` function with the expected results on the three examples described in the problem statement:
* A regular array of digits. 
* An empty array. 
* An array with an unconventional digit. 

These tests cover different scenarios that the function should handle.  Once the code is integrated into a testing framework, these tests will provide error feedback if the code behaves differently from the expected behavior.  This will help maintain the code and easily catch potential issues caused by changes or bugs in the function.  It's a good practice to have comprehensive tests to ensure reliability when dealing with specific problem-solving functions like the one provided.  If the input array is altered, the tests will alert you to any unexpected changes in the function's behavior.  This helps maintain the code's reliability and ensures it adheres to the problem statement's criteria.  It's a good practice to have comprehensive tests to ensure reliability.
