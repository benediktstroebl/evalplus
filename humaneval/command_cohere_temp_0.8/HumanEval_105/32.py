This Python script defines a function `by_length` that solves the problem as described in the prompt. The function first sorts the array of integers, then filters out only the digits that are between 1 and 9, then reverses the array of digits, and finally returns the names of the digits in the reversed order.

The script also includes test cases that check the function's behavior for various input arrays, ensuring that the function correctly handles both valid and invalid inputs as described in the prompt. The test cases use `assert` statements to verify that the actual output of `by_length` function matches the expected result for each case.  This way, the script validates that the function works as expected and provides correct results for the problem statement.  In case of any failures, the block will stop and show the failed test case.  In case of any failures, the block will stop and show the failed test case.

You can use this code as a starting point and ensure it fits well with your coding environment and requirements.  You can certainly modify it to include more test cases or incorporate it into a larger application as needed.  If you encounter any issues or have further questions, please let me know!
