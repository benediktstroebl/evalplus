Here's a Python script that implements the `by_length` function and gets the expected results:
```python
def by_length(arr):
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr, key = lambda x: 1 if x >= 1 and x <= 9 else float('inf'))
    reverse_sorted_arr = sorted(sorted_arr, reverse = True)
    result = []
    for num in reverse_sorted_arr:
      if str(num).isdigit():
        result.append(str(num).translate(str.maketrans('123456789', 'One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine')))
    return result if result else []
```

The provided example usage in the comment above shows how to use the function with the desired output. The function sorts the array based on the length of the number, and then reverses the sorted array. Finally, each digit is replaced with its corresponding name. The function returns an empty list if the input array is empty, and if there is a number that is not between 1 and 9, it is ignored in the result.
