This code provides a function called `by_length` that takes an array of integers as input. It sorts the array of integers from 1 to 9, then reverses this sorted array, and finally converts each digit to its name. The function handles the edge cases of empty arrays and invalid numbers gracefully, ensuring that the output is correct for all scenarios. 

The test cases were also included to systematically check the functionality of the `by_length` function with different input scenarios and ensure that it behaves as expected.  This way, the code follows the DRY principle by encapsulating the entire functionality in a single place, making it easier to maintain and reuse.  Feel free to add this code to your project or modify it to suit your needs.
