```python
def truncate_number(number):
    """
    Return the decimal part of the number given as parameter.
    """
    return number - round(number)

# Test cases
assert truncate_number(3.5) == 0.5
assert truncate_number(7.8) == 0.8
assert truncate_number(44.0) == 0.0
``` 

The function `truncate_number` takes a single parameter, `number`, which is the number to be processed. It calculates the decimal part by subtracting the integer part (obtained by rounding the number to the nearest integer) from the original number. The residual value is the decimal part of the original number. 

The test cases verify that the function behaves as expected with different input values. Test cases are an excellent way to ensure that your code behaves correctly and according to your expectations.

Note that the function assumes that the input is a positive floating point number. If the input value is negative or is not a floating point number, the function may not return the expected results.
