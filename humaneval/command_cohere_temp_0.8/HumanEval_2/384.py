```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    return number - int(number)
```
This function simply subtracts the largest integer less than number from number, which inherently truncates the number to the decimal part alone, which is the desired output. 

To test this script you can run:
```python
TestResult: SUCCESS: All tests passed!
