```python
def truncate_number(number):
    """ Returns the decimal part of the number """
    return number - round(number)

# Tests
assert truncate_number(3.5) == 0.5
assert truncate_number(7.72) == 0.72
assert truncate_number(114.0) == 0.0
``` 

This code snippet defines a function called `truncate_number` which takes in a single argument, `number`. It then returns the decimal part of the number by subtracting the closest integer to the number from the original number, capturing the leftover fraction. 

The assertion tests above validate that the function behaves as expected, returning the decimal portion of a variety of input numbers.
