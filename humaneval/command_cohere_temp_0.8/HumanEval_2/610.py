```python
def truncate_number(number):
    return number - int(number)
```
This function simply subtracts the integer part of the number from the input `number` and returns the residual. 

You can test this function against the provided example and any other numbers to verify the result. 
For example: 
```python
truncate_number(3.5)  # Expected: 0.5
truncate_number(12.345)  # Expected: 0.345
``` 
This will confirm the expected output of the function.
