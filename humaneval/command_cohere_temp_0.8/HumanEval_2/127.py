```python
def truncate_number(number):
    """
    Return the decimal part of the number given as parameter.
    """
    return number - int(number)
```
This function simply takes a number, subtracts the closest integer to it (using `int()` function), and returns the result, which is the decimal part of the number. 

Here are some examples of tests that can be run to validate the function:
```python
# Test suite for the truncate_number function
def test_truncate_number():
    # Test case 1: Positive float
    assert truncate_number(3.5) == 0.5
    assert truncate_number(7.0) == 0.0

    # Test case 2: Negative float
    assert truncate_number(-1.7) == -0.7
    assert truncate_number(-3.0) == -0.0

    # Test case 3: Integer
    assert truncate_number(4) == 0

    # Test case 4: Zero
    assert truncate_number(0) == 0.0

    # Test case 5: Empty string
    assert truncate_number("") == 0.0
```
The tests cover different scenarios like positive and negative numbers, whole numbers, and empty strings to ensure the robustness of the `truncate_number` function.
