```python
def truncate_number(number):
    return number - int(number)
```

The provided Python script defines a function `truncate_number` that takes a single argument, `number`, which is expected to be a positive floating point number. The purpose of this function is to extract and return the decimal part of the input number. This is achieved by utilizing the fact that floating-point numbers can be represented as a combination of an integer part (the largest integer less than or equal to the number) and a fractional part (the remaining value after removing the integer part).

The function uses the integer division (`//`) to calculate the largest integer less than or equal to the input number, and then subtracts this integer part from the original number. The result of this subtraction is the fractional part of the original number, which is then returned as the output of the function.

This approach leverages Python's automatic type conversion to implicitly convert the floating-point input to an integer for the purpose of extraction of the largest integer part. The difference between the original number and the extracted integer represents the remaining fractional part, which is returned as the result.

The script adheres to good coding practices with respect to PEP 8 style guidelines, using lowercase letters with appropriate function naming and argument scoping. Nevertheless, it's important to note that the `truncate_number` function assumes that the input number is inherently valid and caters to the specific case of extracting the decimal part of a positive floating-point number. Additional input validation and error handling could be useful to handle a wider range of scenarios and ensure more robust code.
