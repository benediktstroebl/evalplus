```python
def truncate_number(number):
    return number - int(number)
```

The `truncate_number` function takes a positive floating point number as input and returns the decimal part of the number. 

To understand this, imagine we have a whole number, and we keep dividing it by 2. The part that determines whether the next division will be odd or even is the 'decimal part'. This changes the whole number to odd from even at specific intervals, which is decided by this decimal part. This function captures the essence of this 'decimal part' for any given number.

For example, let's take the number 6.5. Dividing it by 2 gives us 3, with a remainder of 1 (or 0.5). This is the essential idea behind 'truncating' a number, often used in modeling and approximating with limited precision. 

This function simply removes the whole number part of a number by subtracting it from the original number. The returned value is the decimal part of the original number.
