```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    return number - int(number)
```

This function simply computes the difference between the input number and the largest integer less than or equal to the input number, which is the integer part of the number. The residual is the requested decimal part. 

To test this script, you can create a test case like this:
```python
def test_truncate_number():
    assert truncate_number(3.5) == 0.5
    assert truncate_number(7.0) == 0.0
    assert truncate_number(2.8) == 0.2
```

The provided example tests both positive and whole numbers, as well as numbers with two decimal places.
