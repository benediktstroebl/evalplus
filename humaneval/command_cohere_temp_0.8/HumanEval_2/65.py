```python
def truncate_number(number):
    """
    Return the decimal part of the number given as parameter.
    """
    return number - int(number)
```
This function simply subtracts the integer part of the number (obtained by converting number into an integer) to return the decimal part of the number. 

Here's a test case that can be used to verify the functionality of the function:
```python
def test_truncate_number():
    assert truncate_number(3.5) == 0.5
    assert truncate_number(7.0) == 0.0
    assert truncate_number(1.99) == 0.01
```
