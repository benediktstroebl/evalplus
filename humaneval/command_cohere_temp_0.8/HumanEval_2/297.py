```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    return number - int(number)
```
This function simply computes the difference between the input number and the largest integer less than or equal to the input number, which is the integer part of the decomposition that you described. 

This should be the intended solution. Let me know if you'd like me to explain any part of the solution or provide further clarifications.
