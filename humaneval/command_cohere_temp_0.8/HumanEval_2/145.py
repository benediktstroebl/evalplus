```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    return number - int(number)
```
This function simply subtracts the largest integer less than number from number, which is the basic definition of the decimal part of a number. 

To test this function, you can call it with a few different floating point numbers and verify that the output is correct. For example:
```python
truncate_number(3.5)  # Expected output: 0.5
truncate_number(2.8)  # Expected output: 0.8
truncate_number(5.0)  # Expected output: 0.0
``` 
The function should return the correct decimal part for each of these inputs. 
The markdown code block can be added to provide a documentation header in the python script as:
```python
"""
Defines the function truncate_number that calculates the decimal part of a positive floating point number.

Args:
    number (float): A positive floating point number.

Returns:
    float: The decimal part of the number.
"""
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    return number - int(number)
``` 
This helps to provide a clear understanding of the purpose and usage of the function for other developers.
