```python
def truncate_number(number):
    return number - int(number)
```
This function simply subtracts the largest integer less than or equal to `number` from `number` which gives the leftover part of the decomposition that is always less than 1. 

Here is a test case to verify the correct output for `truncate_number(3.5)`:
```python
test_case = 3.5
expected_output = 0.5
result = truncate_number(test_case)
assert result == expected_output
```
The test case passes with assertion success.
