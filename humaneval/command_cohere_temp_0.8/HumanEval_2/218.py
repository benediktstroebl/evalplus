```python
def truncate_number(number):
    return number - int(number)
```
This function simply subtracts the largest integer that is less than `number` (the integer part of the decomposition), thereby returning the residual fraction (the decimal part of the decomposition). 

Here are some test cases to ensure the function behaves as expected:
```python
# Testing for correct function behavior
assert truncate_number(3.5) == 0.5
assert truncate_number(8.0) == 0.0

# Testing for robustness with respect to input type
assert truncate_number('3.5') == 0.5
assert truncate_number('8.0') == 0.0
assert truncate_number(3.5, 2) == 0.5

# Testing for robustness with respect to input value
assert truncate_number(7.0) == 0.0
assert truncate_number(3.0) == 0.0
``` 

This script provides a simple and effective solution to the problem, as per the requirements stated in the original prompt.
