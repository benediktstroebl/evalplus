```python
def truncate_number(number):
    return number - int(number)
```
This function simply subtracts the integer part of the number from the total number, thus returning just the decimal part. 

To test this script, you can call the function with a float input like so: 
 ```python
truncate_number(3.5)
```
The output will be: 0.5. 
If you wish to test other numbers, you may do so in the same manner. 
Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the code further.  Thanks for asking!
