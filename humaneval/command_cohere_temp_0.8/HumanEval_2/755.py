```python
def truncate_number(number):
    """
    Return the decimal part of the number given as parameter.
    """
    return number - int(number)
```

The function `truncate_number` takes a numeric parameter, and returns the decimal part of the parameter. It does so by taking the difference between the original parameter and the integer part of the parameter. The integer part is obtained by converting the parameter to an integer using Python's built-in int() function. The difference between the original number and the integer representation of it yields the decimal part, which is intended to be returned. 

This function directly computes the decimal part and returns it, this approach provides an efficient and concise way of solving the problem. It is important to note that this approach assumes the given number is a positive floating point number. If negative numbers or other number types need to be handled, the function's logic would have to be adjusted accordingly. 

To go even further in terms of handling edge cases, you may consider implementing checks to ensure the parameter is a valid numeric value and handling cases such as NaNs or infinite values, but these scenarios are dependent on the specific problem requirements and test cases. 

This function may be useful in scenarios such as calculating the decimal part of a price after removing taxes or extracting a tolerance level from a maximum value. 

To follow best practices, it is recommended to add additional validation and documentation based on the specific use case and requirements.
