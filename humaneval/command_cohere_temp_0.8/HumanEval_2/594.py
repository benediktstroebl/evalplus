```python
def truncate_number(number):
    return number - int(number)
```

The function takes in a `number` as its input, which is a positive floating point number, and returns the decimal part of the number. It achieves this by taking the difference between the given number and the closest integer (floor value). For example, `truncate_number(3.5)` returns `0.5` since `3.5 - 3 = 0.5`. 

This understanding of the problem can be formulated as:
```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    return number - int(number)
```

The function can be tested as:
```python
def test_truncate_number():
    assert truncate_number(3.5) == 0.5
    assert truncate_number(7.8) == 0.8
    assert truncate_number(2.0) == 0.0
```

The test cases verify that the function returns the correct decimal part for a variety of input numbers.  This would then provide a complete solution to the problem statement.  This approach directly computes the decimal part, which is a simpler and more straightforward approach.
