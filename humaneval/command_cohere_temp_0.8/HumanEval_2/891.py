```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    return number - int(number)
```
This function simply subtracts the largest integer that is less than number from number, which effectively captures the residual value. 

To test this script you can run the following code:
```python
Test truncate_number()
-------------

def test_truncate_number():
    assert truncate_number(3.5) == 0.5
```
This provides a test case that verifies the output of the function for a specific input. 
The output of this code should be the following test passing assertion:
```bash
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.000s

OK
``` 
this indicates that the test case passed and the function behaves as expected. This entire process is one way to demonstrate the usage and functionality of the Python function that accomplishes the desired goal.
