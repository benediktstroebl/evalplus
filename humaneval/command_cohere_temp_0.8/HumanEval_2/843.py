```python
def truncate_number(number):
    return number - int(number)
```

The `truncate_number` function takes a positive floating point number as input and returns the decimal part of the number. It does so by taking the difference between the given number and the closest integer (largest integer smaller than the given number) represented by the number, which effectively removes the integer part of the decomposition. 

Here is a test case to verify the correct composition of the function:
```python
def test_truncate_number():
    assert truncate_number(3.5) == 0.5
    assert truncate_number(7.0) == 0.0
    assert truncate_number(2.8) == 0.2
``` 

The test case confirms the function's behavior for the desired positive floating-point numbers.
