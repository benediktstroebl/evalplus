```python
def truncate_number(number):
    return number - int(number)
```

The provided Python script defines a function `truncate_number` that takes a single argument `number`, which is expected to be a positive floating point number. The purpose of this function is to return the decimal part of the input number. This is achieved by subtracting the integer part of the number from the input number. The integer part is obtained using the `int()` function, which returns the largest integer less than or equal to the input. By subtracting this integer part from the original number, the remaining value is solely the decimal part, which is then returned as the result. This function effectively isolates and returns the decimal portion of the given positive floating point number. 

Let's break down the code and its behavior using an example to illustrate it:
Let's take the input number `3.5` as an example to examine how the `truncate_number` function works:
1. `number = 3.5` is the input to the function.
2. `int(number)` would return `3`, which is the largest integer less than or equal to `3.5`.
3. The function subtracts this integer part from the input number: `3.5 - 3 = 0.5`.
4. The result, `0.5`, is the decimal part of the original input number and is returned by the function.

So, for the input `3.5`, the function returns `0.5`, which is the expected decimal part. The function's design is straightforward and effective, as it directly isolates and returns the decimal portion without any complicated calculations or considerations. This makes it efficient in terms of both computational complexity and code length.
