```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    return number - int(number)
```
This function simply subtracts the largest integer that is less than the input number from the input number, which leaves us with the remaining fractional part of the number, which is what we want. 

To elaborate on the steps taken to arrive at this solution:
1. The problem states that the given number is a positive floating point number, so there is no need to handle negative numbers or integers specifically.
2. The problem also mentions that the integer part can be extracted as the largest integer less than the input number, which can be achieved using the `int()` function and some basic arithmetic.
3. Subtracting the integer part from the input number will give you the remaining fractional part, which is necessarily less than 1. 

This solution may seem counter-intuitive at first since it involves subtracting to find the fractional part. However, it is based on the understanding that the `int()` function rounds numbers down to the nearest integer, and subtracting that from the original number leaves us with the desired fractional part. 

To test this script, you can call the function with a floating-point number as an argument, and it will return the decimal part of that number. For example:
```python
truncate_number(3.5)  # Expected output: 0.5
```
