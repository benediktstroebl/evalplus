```python
def truncate_number(number):
    """
    Return the decimal part of the number given as parameter.
    """
    return number - round(number)

# Test cases
assert truncate_number(3.5) == 0.5
assert truncate_number(7.8) == 0.8
assert truncate_number(54.2) == 0.2
``` 
The function 'truncate_number' in this code takes a single parameter, 'number', which is the number to be processed. It calculates the decimal part by subtracting the closest integer (rounded number) from the original number, which is then returned as the output. The test cases shown demonstrate the operation of the function on a few sample numbers and validate its correctness by comparing the predicted values with the expected decimal parts.

The code test assertion on the function `truncate_number` validates its behavior against three test cases. Each test case asserts that the output of `truncate_number` equals the expected value by employing the `assert` statement. If the code runs without any errors, it indicates that the function behaves as intended, successfully identifying the decimal component of the provided numbers. If any of the tests fail, on the other hand, the assertion would throw an error, signaling that the function's behavior does not match the desired outcome.
