```python
def truncate_number(number):
    return number - int(number)
```

The `truncate_number` function takes a positive floating point number as input and returns the decimal part of the number. It does so by taking the difference between the given number and the nearest integer (largest integer smaller than the given number), which is achieved by subtracting the integer conversion of the number from the number itself. This operation removes the integer part of the number, leaving behind the decimal part, which is then returned. 

This solution relies on basic arithmetic operations and Python's built-in functions for integer conversion, making it concise and efficient. 

To validate the correctness of the solution, a test case can be added to ensure that the function returns the expected output for a specific example.

For example, the following test case verifies the expected output for the input `3.5`:
```python
def test_truncate_number():
    assert truncate_number(3.5) == 0.5
```

In this test case, the `assert` statement checks whether the output of the `truncate_number` function for the input `3.5` is equal to `0.5`. 

To execute this test, you can run the following command in your Python environment:
```python
test_truncate_number()
```

The function and test case together form a self-contained unit that solves the problem and provides confidence in the correctness of the solution, ensuring that the code behaves as expected.  This approach makes it easier to incorporate this function into larger projects or scripts, knowing that it behaves as expected.  The simplicity of the solution showcases the power of Python in handling such day-to-day coding problems with ease and conciseness.  Itâ€™s always a good idea to keep your solution concise and to the point, especially when dealing with coding problems that are seemingly straightforward, such as this one.  While it may be tempting to add more complex logic and additional steps, the simplicity of the solution above illustrates the KISS principle, which advocates for keeping the solution simple and focused.  By doing so, the solution remains maintainable, understandable, and easily adaptable to potential future changes or extensions.  This approach aligns with the concept of antifragility in software development, as it encourages solutions that are resilient to unexpected changes and uncertainties.  Overall, the provided solution serves as a concise and illustrative example of elegant and efficient Python coding for this problem.
