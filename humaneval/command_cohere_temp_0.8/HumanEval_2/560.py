```python
def truncate_number(number):
    """
    Return the decimal part of the number given as parameter.
    """
    return number - int(number)
```

This function takes a float as an input, and returns the decimal part of the number. It does so by taking two integers apart using integer conversion (via **int()** function), and the returning the difference. Such difference can only be the fractional part of the original number, hence the desired output is returned. 

To run the tests, one can use:
```python
test_truncate_number = [
    (3.5, 0.5),
    (2.5, 0.5),
    (1.0, 0.0),
    (1.5, 0.5),
    (10.2, 0.2),
]

for n, expected in test_truncate_number:
    assert truncate_number(n) == expected
```

This code segment provides test cases that verify the functionality of the `truncate_number` function against expected outputs. Each test case is a tuple consisting of an input number and the corresponding expected decimal part. 

The `assert` statement checks if the output of the `truncate_number` function when passed the input number is equal to the expected decimal part. If the input fails to meet the expectation, the `assert` statement raises an error and provides a message pointing to the failed test case. 

In case all the test cases pass without error, it means the `truncate_number` function is functioning as expected.  Should any test case fail, the block will raise an error, thus signaling the need to revisit the function and possibly adjust its code for it to align with the expected outcome.
