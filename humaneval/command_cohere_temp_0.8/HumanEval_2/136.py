```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    return number - int(number)
```

This function simply computes the difference between the given floating point number and the nearest integer, which represents the decimal part of the number. 

To test this script, you can call the function with the example provided in the prompt, like so: 
```python
truncate_number(3.5)
```

The output will be: 

```
0.5
``` 

This confirms that the script successfully computes the decimal part of the number, as per the problem statement.
