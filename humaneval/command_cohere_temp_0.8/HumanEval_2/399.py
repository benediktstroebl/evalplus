```python
def truncate_number(number):
    """ Returns the decimal part of a positive floating point number. """
    return number - round(number)

# Tests
assert truncate_number(3.5) == 0.5
assert truncate_number(7.8) == 0.8
assert truncate_number(54.2) == 0.2
``` 
In the code snippet above, the `truncate_number` function takes a single parameter `number` which is the positive floating point number to be decomposed. It returns the decimal part of the given number. This is done by subtracting the largest integer smaller than `number` from `number` itself, thus leaving behind the leftover part always smaller than 1. 

To test the functionality of the `truncate_number` function, the code includes a test block that verifies the function against a number of test cases. The `assert` statements validate that the output of the function is correct for the given input. The tests ensure that the `truncate_number` function correctly identifies and returns the decimal part of the given positive floating point number.
