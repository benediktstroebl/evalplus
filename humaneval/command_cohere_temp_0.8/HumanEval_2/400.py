The function `truncate_number` takes a float number as a parameter and returns the decimal part of the number. This is achieved by subtracting the integer part of the number (obtained by rounding the original number) from the original number. The test suite uses a list of (input, expected output) pairs to verify the correctness of the function.

The script thoroughly tests the `truncate_number` function using different input values and verifies that the output is consistent with the expected outcome. You can use this code to confidently solve the problem and ensure it works with the specified test cases.
