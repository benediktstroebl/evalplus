```python
def truncate_number(number):
    return number - int(number)
```
This function simply subtracts the integer part of the number from the input `number` and returns the result. 

You can test this function using the following code:
```python
Test truncate_number()
>> truncate_number(3.5)
0.5
>> truncate_number(7.1)
0.1
```
This would yield the desired output of 0.5 and 0.1 respectively.
