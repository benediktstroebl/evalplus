```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Return the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    Usage: triangle_area(a, h)
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```
In this script, the `triangle_area()` function calculates the area of a triangle using the formula `0.5 * a * h`, where `a` is the length of a side and `h` is the height. This formula is a simplified version of the formula for the area of a triangle based on the base and height. It assumes that the base is equal to the given side length, and the height is provided directly.  It returns the area as a floating-point number, accurately representing the real-world measurement of area.
