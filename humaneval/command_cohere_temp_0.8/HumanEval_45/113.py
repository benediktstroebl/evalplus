```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Returns the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    
    Args:
    - a (float): Length of a side of the triangle.
    - h (float): Height of the triangle.
    
    Returns:
    - float: Area of the triangle.
    
    Example:
    >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
    7.5
    """
    if h == 0:  # Prevent division by zero
        return 0
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

This function avoids potential division by zero by checking if the height is zero. Additionally, the function is designed to handle float input to accurately calculate the area, which is naturally variable in real-world applications.

To ensure the function is correct, let's test it with some examples:
```python
def test_triangle_area():
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5
    assert triangle_area(10, 10) == 50.0
    assert triangle_area(10, 0) == 0.0

test_triangle_area()
```

This test suite ensures the function `triangle_area` is correct and ready for production use.
