```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Returns the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    
    Args:
    - a (float): Length of a side of the triangle.
    - h (float): Height of the triangle.
    
    Returns:
    - float: Area of the triangle.
    
    Example:
    >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
    7.5
    """
    if h == 0: 
        return 0  # Divide by zero error if height is 0
    s = (a * h) / 2  # Triangle area formula
    return s
```

The function herein employs the `floating point` approximation approach to calculate the area of a triangle using the given side length and height. This is achieved by applying the formula `Area = (half) * (base * height)`. 

This formula is derived from the fact that the area of a triangle is equivalent to half of the area of a corresponding rectangle formed from the same side lengths.

To ensure there are no complications from improper input, the function also integrates a logical check to deter division by zero when the height is zero.

To showcase functionality, an example use is provided within the function's definition block. Here, a 5 unit side length and 3 unit height are used to calculate the corresponding area, yielding an output of 7.5. 

To fully exercise the code, incorporate it into a test suite containing a variety of test scenarios, including edge cases and different dimensional inputs. 

You can do this by adding the following code to your script: 
```python
import unittest

class TestTriangleArea(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_triangle_area(self):
        self.assertEqual(triangle_area(3, 6), 4.5)
        self.assertEqual(triangle_area(8, 24), 36)
        self.assertEqual(triangle_area(0, 0), 0)
        self.assertEqual(triangle_area(-1, 8), -4)
    def test_triangle_area_edge_cases(self):
        self.assertRaises(ValueError, triangle_area, 10, -5)
        self.assertRaises(ValueError, triangle_area, 0, 10)
        self.assertRaises(ValueError, triangle_area, -3, 3)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This will ensure that your function behaves as expected across a diverse set of inputs.
