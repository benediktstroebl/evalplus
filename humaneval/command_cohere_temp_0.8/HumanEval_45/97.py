```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Returns the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    Args:
        a (float): The length of a side of the triangle.
        h (float): The height of the triangle.
    Returns:
        float: The area of the triangle.
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

To ensure the function is robust, a few tests are also included to validate the functionality of the `triangle_area` function.

```python
# Test suite for triangle_area
import pytest

def test_triangle_area( ):
    # Test case 1: Basic validation
    result = triangle_area(5, 3)
    assert result == 7.5

def test_triangle_area_edge_cases( ):
    # Test case 2: Edge cases
    assert triangle_area(0, 0) == 0
    assert triangle_area(10, 0) == 0
    assert triangle_area(0, 10) == 0

def test_triangle_area_negative_input( ):
    # Test case 3: Negative input
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        triangle_area(-1, 1)
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        triangle_area(1, -1)
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        triangle_area(-1, -1)
```

This test suite aims to cover multiple scenarios to ensure that `triangle_area` function behaves as expected. 

The `test_triangle_area` function checks if the function correctly calculates the area of a triangle with a positive side length and height. 

The `test_triangle_area_edge_cases` assert the function's behavior for cases where zeros or negative values are passed as inputs. 

Lastly, the `test_triangle_area_negative_input` section validates that the function raises `ValueError` when it receives negative input values, confirming the expected behavior of the function to deal with such cases. 

To execute these tests, you can use a framework like `pytest`, which provides the ` pytest ` command-line tool. 

This command will run all the test functions contained within the script. 

```bash
pytest
```

For more advanced test discovery and execution, you can also use the `pytest` framework's command-line options to specify which specific test functions to run, directories where tests reside, and more. 

Please make sure to have `pytest` installed, typically done by running `pip install pytest` in your terminal.
