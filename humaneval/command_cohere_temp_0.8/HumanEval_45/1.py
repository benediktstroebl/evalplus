```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Return the area of a triangle given a side length and height.
    
    Args:
    - a (float): Side length of triangle
    - h (float): Height of triangle
    
    Returns:
    - float: Area of triangle aycine
    
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```
The function directly uses the formula for the area of a triangle which is `A = (1/2) * base * height`. The two parameters `base` and `height` are the side length and height of the triangle respectively, which are the parameters needed to calculate the area of a triangle. 
The docstring explains the purpose of the function, the types of parameters, and the return type. It also includes a simple test example that demonstrates how to use the function.
