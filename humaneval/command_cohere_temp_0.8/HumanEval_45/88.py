```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Returns the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    Args:
        a (float): The length of a side of the triangle.
        h (float): The height of the triangle.
    Returns:
        float: The area of the triangle.
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

To ensure the robustness of the code, test cases should be added to cover different scenarios and edge cases. Here are some additional tests that can be added:

1. Test for a negative height:
```python
assert triangle_area(7, -3) == 0
```

2. Test for a side length of 0:
```python
assert triangle_area(0, 5) == 0
```

3. Test for a side length equal to the height:
```python
assert triangle_area(5, 5) == 12.5
```

4. Test for a very large side length:
```python
assert triangle_area(100, 7) == 350
```

These additional tests will help ensure that the function behaves correctly in various scenarios and contributes to providing a reliable and robust solution to the problem.
