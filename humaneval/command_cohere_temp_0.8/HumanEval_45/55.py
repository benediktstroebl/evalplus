```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Return the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    Output units are 2D Euclidean space.
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```
The formula to compute the area of a triangle using one side length `a` and height `h` is `Area = 0.5 * a * h`.
