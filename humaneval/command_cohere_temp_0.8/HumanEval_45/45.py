```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Return the area of a triangle given a side length and height.
    
    Args:
    - a (float): Side length of triangle
    - h (float): Height of triangle
    
    Returns:
    - float: Area of the triangle 
    """ 
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

This function calculates the area of a triangle using the formula `area = 0.5 * a * h`, where `a` is the length of the side and `h` is the height. Note that the function assumes that the height is the distance from the base of the triangle to the opposite vertex. 

To get the total area of the triangle, you can multiply the length of the base (side) by the height and divide by 2. This formula is a simplification of the geometric formula. 

To further clarify, the following example demonstrates how to use the function to calculate the area of a triangle with a side length of 5 and a height of 3:
```python
>>> triangle_area(5, 3)
7.5
```

This is consistent with the initial prompt, which states that the function's test case has a side length of 5 and a height of 3, and the area 7.5. 

You can employ this function to calculate the area of any triangle, irrespective of the side length or height, for you to gain insights into the spatial characteristics of these geometric shapes. 

Feel free to ask any questions if you're unsure of how best to apply this function and produce useful outputs.
