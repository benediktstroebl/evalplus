```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Returns the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    Args:
        a (float): The length of a side of the triangle.
        h (float): The height of the triangle.
    Returns:
        float: The area of the triangle.
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

To ensure the robustness of the function, test cases should be added to cover different scenarios, capturing edge cases and various input combinations. Furthermore, documenting the function according to PEP 257 will provide additional useful information for users who may wish to understand the function's purpose and usage. For example, we could include information about the units expected for 'a' and 'h', and what the return value should be, along with common conventions such as noting the presence of optional or required arguments.
