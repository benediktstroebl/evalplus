```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Return the area of a triangle given a side length and height.
    
    Args:
    - a (float): Side length of triangle
    - h (float): Height of triangle
    
    Returns:
    - float: Area of triangle ayc^2 = 1/2 * a * h
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

This function adheres to the problem statement and description, and will return the area of a triangle when given a side length and height. It assumes a straight triangle; if reqired, modification will be needed for other types of triangles. 

To see the function in action, run the following code:
```python
>>> triangle_area(5, 3)
7.5
```

This will return the area of a triangle with a side length of 5 and a height of 3.
