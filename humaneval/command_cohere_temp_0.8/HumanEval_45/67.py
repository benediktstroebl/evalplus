```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculate the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    """
    # Calculate the area using the formula
    area = 0.5 * a * h
    return area
```

The function 'triangle_area' accepts the parameters 'a,' which stands for side length, and 'h,' which represents height. Using the formula 0.5 * a * h, it directly calculates and returns the area of a triangle. This formula is derived from the fact that the area of a triangle is equal to half the product of its base and height.
