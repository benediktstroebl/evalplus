```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Return the area of a triangle given a side length and height.
    
    Args:
    - a (float): Length of side of triangle
    - h (float): Height of triangle
    
    Returns:
    - float: Area of the triangle 
    """ 
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

This function utilizes the formula `area = 0.5 * base * height` to calculate the area of the triangle. This formula is generally applicable to triangles, irrespective of the particular side chosen as the base.
