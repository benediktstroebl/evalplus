```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculate the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    """
    pi = 3.14159
    area = (pi / 2) * a * h
    return area
```
The function `triangle_area` takes two parameters, `a` and `h`, representing the length of a side and the height of the triangle, respectively. It calculates the area of the triangle using the formula `((π)/2) * a * h`, where `π` is an approximation of pi (3.14159), and returns the area.
