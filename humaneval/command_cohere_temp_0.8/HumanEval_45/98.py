```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Returns the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    Args:
        a (float): The length of a side of the triangle.
        h (float): The height of the triangle.
    Returns:
        float: The area of the triangle. 
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

To ensure the function is robust, few test cases are necessary to verify the correctness of the function. 
Here is an example: 
 ```python
import unittest

class TestTriangleArea(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_triangle_area_with_side_and_height(self):
        self.assertEqual(triangle_area(10, 5), 25)

    def test_triangle_area_with_zero_side_and_height(self):
        self.assertEqual(triangle_area(0, 5), 0)

    def test_triangle_area_with_negative_side_and_height(self):
        self.assertEqual(triangle_area(-5, 3), -7.5)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
``` 

This test suite contains three distinct tests, each of which verifies the functionality of the `triangle_area()` function in a specific scenario. 

In the test `test_triangle_area_with_side_and_height`, the function is tested by using a side length of 10 and a height of 5. The expected output is 25, which is half of the product of the side length and the height. 

The test `test_triangle_area_with_zero_side_and_height` verifies the function's behavior when a side length of 0 and a height of 5 are provided. Since a triangle cannot be constructed with these dimensions, the expected output is 0. 

For the case of `test_triangle_area_with_negative_side_and_height`, the input values are -5 for the side length and 3 for the height. The anticipated output is -7.5, which is half of the product of the side length and the height. 

These test cases cover various scenarios and ensure that the `triangle_area()` function operates correctly and returns the anticipated results.
