```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Return the area of a triangle given a side length and height.
    Usage: triangle_area(a, h)
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```
The function `triangle_area()` calculates the area of a triangle using the formula `0.5 * a * h`, where `a` is the length of the side and `h` is the height. This area formula is specifically for triangles that are equilateral, where the angle opposite the side of length `a` is `90` degrees.
