```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Returns the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    Args:
        a (float): The length of a side of the triangle.
        h (float): The height of the triangle.
    Returns:
        float: The area of the triangle.
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

To ensure the robustness of the function, test cases should be added to cover different scenarios, accounting for side lengths greater than zero and heights greater than zero to avoid potential division by zero errors. Additionally, include tests for edge cases like long and tall triangles to ensure the function's accuracy for a wide range of inputs.

Once the function is thoroughly tested, feel free to incorporate it into your project, using it to calculate the area of triangles whenever applicable. If you encounter any obstacles or have further questions pertaining to function utilization or testing, do not hesitate to ask.

To execute the tests for this function copy and paste the following code into a Python file and run it:
```python
import unittest

def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Returns the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height."""
    return 0.5 * a * h

class TestTriangleArea(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_triangle_area(self):
        self.assertEqual(triangle_area(5, 3), 7.5)

    def test_triangle_area_with_negative_values(self):
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            triangle_area(-3, 3)

    def test_triangle_area_with_zero_height(self):
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            triangle_area(5, 0)

    def test_triangle_area_with_zero_base(self):
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            triangle_area(0, 5)
```
