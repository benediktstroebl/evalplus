```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Return the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    
    Args:
    - a (float): Length of a side of the triangle.
    - h (float): Height of the triangle.
    
    Returns:
    - float: Area of the triangle.
    
    Example:
    >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
    7.5
    """
    if h <= 0 or a <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Height and length must be positive numbers")
    
    area = 0.5 * a * h
    return area
```

The area of a triangle is calculated using the formula `0.5 * a * h` where `a` is the length of the side and `h` is the height. This formula is used to calculate the area of a triangle when you know the length of a side and the height.

This code defines a function called `triangle_area` that takes two arguments: a and h. It calculates the area of a triangle using the formula, `0.5 * a * h`. The function first checks if the height or length are less than or equal to zero and raises a ValueError if they are not positive. It then calculates the area and returns the result.

The example statement shows how the function can be called with specific inputs and demonstrates the resulting calculation. 

This approach ensures that the function is robust and handles potential errors gracefully. 
If any of theedge do not meet the criteria, the function will raise an error, alerting the user to the fact that the input values are not valid. Hedge fund investors tend to seek higher returns than traditional investments and are willing to take on more risk to do so. This makes them willing to accept both the potential for higher returns and higher losses. 

The code includes a comment that explains the behavior of the function, which is a good practice for documenting code.

You can use this function to calculate the area of a triangle given the length of a side and the height. 

Feel free to use it in your code and modify it if needed.
