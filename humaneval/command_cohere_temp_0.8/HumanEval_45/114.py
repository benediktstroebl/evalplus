```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Returns the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    
    Args:
    - a (float): Length of a side of the triangle.
    - h (float): Height of the triangle.
    
    Returns:
    - float: Area of the triangle.
    
    Example:
    >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
    7.5
    """
    if h <= 0 or a <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Height and side length must be positive")
    
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

The function includes inputs (`a`, `h`) and outputs the area of the triangle using the formula `0.5 * a * h`. The docstring provides explanation, usage guidance, and an example for the function.
