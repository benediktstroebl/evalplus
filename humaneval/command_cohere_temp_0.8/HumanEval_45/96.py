```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Return the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    Args:
    - a (float): Length of a side of the triangle.
    - h (float): Height of the triangle.
    Returns:
    - float: Area of the triangle.
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

To ensure the robustness of the function, test cases should be added to cover different scenarios, such as validation of input types and sizes, as well as edge cases like `0` or negative input values. Additionally, incorporating documentation and comments within the code would be beneficial for understanding and maintaining the function. It's also worth noting that this function assumes the height is the distance between the side's base and the apex of the triangle. If the height is the length of a different side, the function would need to be adjusted accordingly.
