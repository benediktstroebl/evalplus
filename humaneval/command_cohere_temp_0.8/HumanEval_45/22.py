```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculate the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    """
    # Using the formula for triangle area: A = (1/2) * a * h
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

The function `triangle_area` takes two parameters, `a` (the length of a side of the triangle) and `h` (the height of the triangle). It then uses the formula for the area of a triangle (half the product of the two) to calculate the area and returns the calculated area. 

To run the code, you can save it in a `.py` file, open a terminal there, navigate to the directory and run the file. You can also upload it to a Python environment on an online IDE. Finally, you may want to write tests to ensure the function's correctness. After writing the tests, you can run them to see if they pass.
