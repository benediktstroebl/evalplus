```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Return the area of a triangle given a side length and height.
    
    Args:
    - a (float): Side length of triangle
    - h (float): Height of triangle
    
    Returns:
    - float: Area of the triangle 
    """ 
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

This function calculates the area of a triangle using the formula `area = 0.5 * a * h`, where `a` is the length of the side and `h` is the height. Note that the function includes detailed instructions (docstrings) to explain how to use the function and what the expected inputs are. These help guides help make the code more understandable and usable by others.
