```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculate the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    """
    pi = 3.14159
    area = (pi / 2) * a * h
    return area
```
The function `triangle_area` takes in two parameters, `a` and `h`, representing the length of a side and the height of a triangle, respectively. 
It calculates the area of the triangle using the formula (`(π` / 2) * `a * h`) and returns the area. 

This formula is based on the fact that the area of a triangle can be calculated using its base and height, where the base can be thought of as an angle of the triangle forming a right angle with the height. The factor (`(π` / 2)) accounts for the angle, and the base and height are multiplied to calculate the area. 

This approach provides an accurate calculation of the triangle's area.  If `a` and `h` represent the lengths of the base and height of the triangle, respectively, this method provides an easy way to calculate the area of any triangle. 

This formula is widely used among students, engineers, and mathematicians to calculate triangle areas and is a key concept in geometry and trigonometry.  It is an essential tool for determining the size of triangular regions in various fields of science and engineering.
