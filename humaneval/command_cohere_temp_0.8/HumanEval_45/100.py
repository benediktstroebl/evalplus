```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Returns the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    Args:
        a (float): The length of a side of the triangle.
        h (float): The height of the triangle.
    Returns:
        float: The area of the triangle. 
    Example:
        >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
        7.5
    """
    triangle_area = (a * h) / 2  # Triangle area formula
    return triangle_area
```

The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula ` `(base * height) / 2 ``, as demonstrated in the code above. This formula is a part of the Euclidean geometry and is frequently used in many fields, including trigonometry, physics, and engineering, for calculation purposes. It's an essential principle for understanding spatial relationships and fundamental in these disciplines to calculate volumes and dimensions of triangular shapes.
