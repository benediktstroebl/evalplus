```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Return the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    Output units are 2D Euclidean space.
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```
The formula used, whereby the area of a triangle is calculated using the formula `Area = 0.5 * base * height`, comes straight out of the Euclidean geometry textbook. This formula is universally applicable for every right-angled triangle.
