```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Return the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    Args:
    - a (float): Length of a side of the triangle.
    - h (float): Height of the triangle.
    Returns:
    - float: Area of the triangle.
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

This function calculates the area of a triangle when given one side's length and the height using the formula `0.5 * a * h` where `a` represents the length of the side and `h` represents the height. This formula is based on the fact that the total area of a triangle is equal to the product of half its base and height.

To ensure correctness, the function includes appropriate comments to clarify its purpose and how it executes this calculation, as well as how the calculation is derived. 

To verify the function, a variety of tests could be executed, for instance:
```python
# Test for a right triangle with side lengths 1 and height 1
assert triangle_area(1, 1) == 1.0

# Test for a right triangle with side lengths 3 and height 4
assert triangle_area(3, 4) == 6.0

# Test for a non-right triangle with side lengths 5 and height 7.5
assert triangle_area(5, 7.5) == 15.0
```

These tests cover multiple scenarios, ensuring that the function accurately computes the triangle area, and validates the function's correctness for different triangle configurations.
