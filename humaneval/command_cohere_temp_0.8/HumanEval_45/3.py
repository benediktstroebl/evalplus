```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculate the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    """
    # Calculate the area using the formula derived from Heron's formula
    area = 0.5 * a * h
    return area
```

This function utilizes the formula derived from Heron's formula to calculate the area of a triangle when given the length of a side (a) and its height (h).
