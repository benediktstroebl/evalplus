```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculate the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    """
    # Calculate the area using the formula
    area = 0.5 * a * h
    return area
```

The function 'triangle_area' in this script requires two inputs: the length of one side of the triangle (a) and the height of the triangle (h). It calculates and provides the triangle's area by using the formula '0.5 * a * h', which represents half of the triangle's base multiplied by its height. 

This formula relates to the formula for the area of a triangle which is (1/2) * base * height.
