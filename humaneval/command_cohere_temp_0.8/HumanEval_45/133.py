```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculate the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    """
    pi = 3.14159
    area = (pi / 2) * a * h
    return area
```
The function directly uses the formula for the area of a triangle (given side `a` and height `h`) to calculate the area, this formula is `(1/2) * a * h `and directly uses the value of pi (`3.14159`) for accuracy.  This formula is used in the calculation and directly returns the area. 
The comment explains the process for clarity.
