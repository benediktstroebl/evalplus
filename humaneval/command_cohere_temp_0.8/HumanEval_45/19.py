```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculate the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    """
    # Calculate the area using the formula derived from the definition of the area
    area = 0.5 * a * h
    return area
```
The function `triangle_area` takes in two parameters, `a` and `h`, representing the length of a side and the height of a triangle, respectively. It calculates the area of the triangle using the formula `0.5 * a * h`, complying with the definition of triangle area as half the product of its base and height. This formula allows for a straightforward and efficient calculation of the triangle's area.
