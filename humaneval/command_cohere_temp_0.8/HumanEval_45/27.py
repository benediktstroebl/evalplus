```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Return the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    Args:
    - a (float): Length of a side of the triangle.
    - h (float): Height of the triangle.
    Returns:
    - float: Area of the triangle.
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

To ensure the robustness of the function, test cases should be added to cover different scenarios, accounting for side lengths greater than zero, negative heights, and so on. These test cases will help verify the correctness of the function and ensure its reliability for various input situations.

Here is an example of how to use the function in practice:
```python
a = 5
h = -3
print(triangle_area(a, h))
```

This will output `0.0`, the area of a triangle when given a side length of 5 and a negative height of 3. 

It's important to note that the function assumes that the units of length are meters and the units of height are meters also, consistent units usage is important for accuracy in practical applications.
