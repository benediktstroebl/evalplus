```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculate the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    """
    pi = 3.14159
    area = (pi / 2) * a * h
    return area
```
The function directly calculates the area of a triangle using the formula `Area = (π / 2) * a * h`, where `a` is the length of the side and `h` is the height. The value of π is set to 3.14159 for simplicity.
