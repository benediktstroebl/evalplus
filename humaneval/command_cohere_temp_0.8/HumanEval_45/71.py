```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Returns the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    Args:
        a (float): The length of a side of the triangle.
        h (float): The height of the triangle.
    Returns:
        float: The area of the triangle.
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

To ensure the robustness of the function, test cases should be added to cover different scenarios, such as floats, integers, and edge cases. Adding assertions to the function like `assert isinstance(result, float)` is also important to guarantee type correctness. These enhancements can provide better code reliability and help catch potential errors during development.
