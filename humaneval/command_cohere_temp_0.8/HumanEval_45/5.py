```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Returns the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    Args:
        a (float): The length of a side of the triangle.
        h (float): The height of the triangle.
    Returns:
        float: The area of the triangle.
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```
In the above code, the function `triangle_area` takes in two parameters, `a` and `h`, representing the length of a side and the height of the triangle, respectively. It then returns the area of the triangle using the formula `0.5 * a * h`.

To ensure accuracy, the function does not include any assumptions or calculations pertaining to the triangle's symmetry. It merely leverages the provided side length and height to compute the area, adhering to the problem's fundamental requirements.

You can implement unit tests to ensure the function behaves as expected using the `unittest` module:
```python
import unittest

class TestTriangleArea(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_triangle_area_positive(self):
        self.assertEqual(triangle_area(2, 3), 3.0)
    
    def test_triangle_area_zero_height(self):
        self.assertEqual(triangle_area(2, 0), 0.0)
    
    def test_triangle_area_zero_side(self):
        self.assertEqual(triangle_area(0, 5), 0.0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
This test suite includes three distinct tests, each leveraging the `assertEqual` method to confirm that the area computed by the `triangle_area` function aligns with the anticipated value. To execute these tests, the `unittest.main()` function is invoked. 
If you need to handle more test scenarios, you can add them to the test suite by extending the `TestTriangleArea` class and writing additional `test_*` functions. 

This script ensures the `triangle_area` function's correctness and handling of edge cases through the suite of tests, reinforcing the reliability of your code. 

Note: Ensure the Python environment and codebase have the requisite packages installed (i.e., `unittest`) to run the tests without errors. For streamlined testing, consider utilizing a test-driven development (TDD) approach, creating the tests prior to writing the `triangle_area` function itself. This approach helps pinpoint the exact requirements and validates your code concurrently with development.
