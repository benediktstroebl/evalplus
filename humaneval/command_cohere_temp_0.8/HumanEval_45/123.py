```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Returns the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    
    Args:
    - a (float): Length of a side of the triangle.
    - h (float): Height of the triangle.
    
    Returns:
    - float: Area of the triangle.
    
    Example:
    >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
    7.5
    """
    # Calculate base of the triangle
    b = a ** 2 + h ** 2  # Pythagorean theorem
    # Calculate area using formula
    area = 0.5 * a * b
    return area
```

The area of a triangle can be calculated using its base and height. In this case, the length of the side is `a`, and the height is `h`. The base of the triangle is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem as `a ** 2 + h ** 2`. The area is then calculated by multiplying the base by half of the length of the side, `0.5 * a * b`. 

This area formula was explained in the previous response and is a direct application of the geometric formula for calculating the area of a triangle. 

The function has been updated to include a docstring, which provides a more comprehensive description of the function, its arguments, and its return value. It also includes an example usage that tests the function with predefined values.
