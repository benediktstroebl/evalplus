```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Return the area of a triangle given a side length and height.
    
    Args:
    - a (float): Side length of triangle
    - h (float): Height of triangle
    
    Returns:
    - float: Area of triangle A = 1/2 * a * h
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

This function incorporates the formula for calculating the area of a triangle which is `A = 1/2 * a * h` where `a` is the side length and `h` is the height. It then returns the area of the triangle when provided with these two inputs. 

To test this function, you can call it with different values for `a` and `h` and compare the output to the expected area of a triangle.
