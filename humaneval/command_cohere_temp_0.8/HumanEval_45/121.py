```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Returns the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    Args:
        a (float): The length of a side of the triangle.
        h (float): The height of the triangle.
    Returns:
        float: The area of the triangle.
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

The function `triangle_area` calculates the area of a triangle using the formula `0.5 * a * h`, where `a` is the length of a side and `h` is the height. This formula is based on the fact that the total area of a triangle is equal to the product of half its base and height. 

To see an example of usage, you can run the following script:
```python
import unittest

class TestTriangleArea(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_triangle_area(self):
        self.assertEqual(triangle_area(5, 3), 7.5)

    def test_triangle_area_edge_cases(self):
        self.assertEqual(triangle_area(0, 0), 0)
        self.assertEqual(triangle_area(10, 0), 0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This test suite includes two tests:
- `test_triangle_area`: This tests the function with a side length of 5 and height of 3, and the expected output is 7.5.
- `test_triangle_area_edge_cases`: This tests the function with edge cases, where the side length or height is zero, and the function should return 0.

To run the tests, you need to have the `unittest` module installed. You can install it using `pip install unittest` or `sudo pip install unittest`. You can then run the script using `python script_name.py`. The script will run the tests and display the results, including any failures or errors. 

This way, you can validate the correctness of the code and ensure that the function calculates the triangle area correctly. 
  
 
**Note:** 
- This formula assumes that the base of the triangle is equal to the given side length, and the height of the triangle is equal to the given height. If the triangle is oriented differently it may require additional adjustments. 
- This formula is applicable only to triangles with a right angle. For other types of triangles, this formula will result in an approximation of the triangle's area. It's essential to incorporate thorough testing, covering different scenarios and edge cases, to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the area calculation.
