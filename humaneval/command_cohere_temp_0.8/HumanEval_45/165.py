```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Return the area of a triangle given a side length and height.
    
    Args:
    - a (float): Side length of triangle
    - h (float): Height of triangle
    
    Returns:
    - float: Area of the triangle 
    """ 
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

This function leverages the geometric formula for the area of a triangle which is `area = 0.5 * base * height`. 

Given the `base` is the side length `a` and the `height` is the corresponding height `h` of the triangle, the area can be calculated by multiplying these two variables by 0.5. 

The unit of length for both `a` and `h` plays a crucial role in determining the unit of the area and input lengths should be provided accordingly. 

Let me know if further clarification is needed!
