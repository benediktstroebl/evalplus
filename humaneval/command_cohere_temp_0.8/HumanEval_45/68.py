```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Returns the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    Args:
        a (float): The length of a side of the triangle.
        h (float): The height of the triangle.
    Returns:
        float: The area of the triangle.
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```
In the above code, the function `triangle_area` takes in two parameters, `a` and `h`, representing the length of a side and the height of a triangle, respectively. It then calculates the area of the triangle using the formula `0.5 * a * h` and returns the result. Feel free to test this function using the provided signature and example in the docstring, and let me know if you need any further assistance!
