```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculate the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    """
    pi = 3.14159
    area = (pi / 2) * a * h
    return area
```
The function utilizes the formula `area = (pi / 2) * a * h` to compute the triangle's area, where `a` represents the side length and `h` signifies the height.
