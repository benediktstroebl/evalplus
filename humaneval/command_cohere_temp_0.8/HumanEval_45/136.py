```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculate the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    """
    # Using the formula for triangle area
    area = 0.5 * a * h
    return area
```

To see how to obtain the area of a triangle using either the base or height, try commenting out one of the components and running the function with the input `5, 3`. You'll observe that the result is inaccurate due to the missing component. The necessary component is critical for arriving at the correct area, illustrating the significance of each element in mathematical formulas.
