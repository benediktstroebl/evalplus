```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Returns the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    Args:
        a (float): The length of a side of the triangle.
        h (float): The height of the triangle.
    Returns:
        float: The area of the triangle.
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

To ensure the robustness of the function, test cases should be added to cover different scenarios, capturing edge cases and various input combinations. The following code provides a start toward that with a few test cases:
```python
import pytest

def test_triangle_area(a=5, h=3):
    assert triangle_area(a, h) == 7.5

def test_triangle_area_with_negative_input():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        triangle_area(-1, 1)

def test_triangle_area_with_zero_height():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        triangle_area(1, 0)
```

This is just a starting point as comprehensive test suites often encompass a broader range of scenarios, including different triangle configurations, edge cases, and exceptional scenarios.

To illustrate the usage of the function, below is a brief example:
```python
result = triangle_area(7, 4)
print(f"The area of the triangle is {result}")
```

Executing this code would yield the output:
```
The area of the triangle is 28.0
```
