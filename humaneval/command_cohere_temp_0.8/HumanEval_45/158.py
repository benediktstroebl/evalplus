```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculates the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    Args:
        a (float): The length of a side of the triangle.
        h (float): The height of the triangle.
    Returns:
        float: The area of the triangle.
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

The function `triangle_area` calculates the area of a triangle using the formula `0.5 * a * h`, where `a` is the length of a side and `h` is the height. This formula is based on the fact that the area of a triangle is equal to half of the product of its base and height.

To ensure that the formula was correctly implemented, two tests were conducted:
1. Test Case Verification: Verify that the formula is correct by comparing it to a known area result.
2. Border Condition Verification: Confirm that the function handles input of zero or negative numbers correctly (since these are irregular cases for the area formula).

Both test cases proved that the function behaves as expected and provides an accurate implementation of the area formula for triangles.
