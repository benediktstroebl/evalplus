```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Returns the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    Args:
        a (float): The length of a side of the triangle.
        h (float): The height of the triangle.
    Returns:
        float: The area of the triangle.
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

To ensure the robustness of the function, test cases should be added to cover different scenarios, accounting for edge cases and input validation. Adding assertions to checks helps confirm the expected behavior of the function. Here is an example:
```python
import pytest

def test_triangle_area():
    """Tests the triangle_area function."""
    
    # Positive valid case
    assert triangle_area(3, 6) == 9
    
    # Negative valid case
    assert triangle_area(-3, -6) == 0.5
    
    # Edge case for zero height
    with pytest.warns(UserWarning):
        assert triangle_area(4, 0) == 0

```

By incorporating these tests, you can verify the correctness of the function and ensure it handles various input scenarios effectively. 
If you encounter any specific challenges or require further refinement of the code, feel free to ask for assistance. Pertinent tests can also be added to cover scenarios like invalid input types or empty inputs, to further enhance the function's robustness.
