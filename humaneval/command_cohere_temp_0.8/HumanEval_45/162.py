```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Returns the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    Args:
        a (float): The length of a side of the triangle.
        h (float): The height of the triangle.
    Returns:
        float: The area of the triangle.
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

To ensure the robustness of the function, test cases should be added to cover different scenarios and edge cases. Here are some test cases to get started:
```python
# Test cases for the triangle_area function
def test_triangle_area():
    # Test case with basic inputs
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5

    # Test case with negative height
    assert triangle_area(6, -2) == -3.0

    # Test case with zero length
    assert triangle_area(0, 4) == 0.0

    # Test case with length equals height
    assert triangle_area(5, 5) == 12.5

    # Test case with shallow triangle
    assert triangle_area(10, 0.1) == 0.05

    # Test case with very long side
    assert triangle_area(20, 10) == 100.0
```

To run the test cases, a testing framework like `pytest` can be used. Once `pytest` is installed, you can run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pytest -v
```

This will execute the test cases and display a summary of the test results, including any failures or errors encountered.

You can also incorporate automated testing, which continuously validates that the function behaves correctly even after modifications or updates. This ensures the enduring integrity of the function over time. 

By rigorously testing the function, you can verify its behavior in multiple scenarios and ensure that it remains robust, accurate, and reliable regardless of input variations.
