```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Returns the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    Args:
        a (float): The length of a side of the triangle.
        h (float): The height of the triangle.
    Returns:
        float: The area of the triangle.
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

To ensure the robustness of the function, test cases should be added to cover different scenarios, capturing edge cases and various input combinations. Here is an example:
```python
def test_triangle_area():
    # Basic Test
    assert triangle_area(3, 4) == 6.0

    # Edge Cases
    assert triangle_area(0, 5) == 0.0
    assert triangle_area(10, 0) == 0.0
    assert triangle_area(0, 0) == 0.0

    # Degenerate Triangle
    assert triangle_area(0, 10) == 0.0
    assert triangle_area(5, 0) == 0.0

    # Large Triangle
    assert triangle_area(10, 10) == 100.0
    assert triangle_area(15, 20) == 225.0

    # Confirm Symmetry
    assert triangle_area(5, 8) == triangle_area(8, 5)
``` 

To run the test suite, the code can be executed using the `python -m unittest test_triangle_area` command, which will run all defined test functions and report any failures or errors. 

This way, you can ensure that the function behaves as expected and reliably computes the triangle area for different valid inputs.
