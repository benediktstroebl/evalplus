```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Returns the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    Args:
        a (float): The length of a side of the triangle.
        h (float): The height of the triangle.
    Returns:
        float: The area of the triangle.
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

To ensure the robustness of the function, test cases should be added to cover different scenarios, capturing edge cases and various inputs. The function's docstring also complies with the problem statement by providing informative usage instructions and a simple example.

Here is how you might verify the correctness of the function using Python's built-in `unittest` module:
```python
import unittest

class TestTriangleArea(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_triangle_area(self):
        self.assertEqual(triangle_area(5, 3), 7.5)
    
    def test_negative_height(self):
        self.assertAlmostEqual(triangle_area(10, -2), 15.0)

    def test_zero_length(self):
        self.assertEqual(triangle_area(0, 5), 0.0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This test suite includes multiple test cases, each designed to validate a specific scenario. By employing `unittest.main()` to run the tests, the script acts as a self-contained test driver. 

To execute the script and undergo the tests, run the file. The program's exit status will indicate success if all tests are passed successfully. Conversely, if any tests fail, the program will indicate failure and provide more information about the specific misstep. 

An overview of the test cases:
- `test_triangle_area`: This basic affirmative test validates the function with input values akin to those in the docstring example.
- `test_negative_height`: Examines the function's handling of a negative height, ensuring it returns the correct area of the triangle despite the negative value.
- `test_zero_length`: Evaluates the function's behavior when provided with a side length of 0, confirming that it returns 0 for the triangle's area, which is logically appropriate. 

You should always ensure your code and tests are robust, comprehensive, and adaptable, enabling you to address potential changes and emerging requirements.
