```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculate the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    """
    pi = 3.14159
    area = (pi / 2) * a * h
    return area
```
The function `triangle_area` takes in two variables `a` and `h` representing the side length of a triangle and its height respectively. 
The formula for the area of a triangle is  `ARS = (1/2) * BASE * HEIGHT ` , the formula used in the code, where ARS is the area of the triangle, BASE is the base of the triangle, and HEIGHT is the height of the triangle. The function returns the calculated area of the triangle.
