```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Return the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    Usage: triangle_area(a, h)
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```
In the above code, the function `triangle_area` calculates the area of a triangle using the formula `Area = 0.5 * a * h`, where `a` is the length of the side and `h` is the height. You can use this function to calculate the area of any triangle with the provided formula.
