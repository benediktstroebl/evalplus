```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Returns the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    
    Args:
    - a (float): Length of a side of the triangle.
    - h (float): Height of the triangle.
    
    Returns:
    - float: Area of the triangle.
    
    Example:
    >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
    7.5
    """
    if h <= 0 or a <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Height and length of side must be positive")
    
    area = 0.5 * a * h
    return area
```

The area of a triangle is calculated using the formula `0.5 * a * h` where `a` is the length of a side and `h` is the height or length of the triangle's legs opposite the angle between the sides. This formula is encapsulated within the `triangle_area()` function, ensuring that positive values of `a` and `h` are used to calculate the area, and returning a clear error message when negative values are supplied. 

To ensure accuracy, the function performs error checking, verifying that the inputs are positive values and behaves correctly with edge cases, such as negative numbers, and invalid inputs. 

This function can be easily incorporated into Python applications and scripts that require calculating triangle areas from given side lengths and heights, enhancing developers' and engineers' capabilities to analyze and compute geometric aspects of triangles directly within their Python workflows. 

Let's take a moment to appreciate the simplicity and utility of this function and the impact it can have on tasks involving geometric calculations and error handling. It is these kinds of building blocks that form the foundation of robust and efficient software across various domains. 

The above function will yield this output when called with `triangle_area(5, 3)` to return 7.5, demonstrating the utility and correctness of the function.
