```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Returns the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    Args:
        a (float): The length of a side of the triangle.
        h (float): The height of the triangle.
    Returns:
        float: The area of the triangle. 
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

To ensure the function is robust, add tests that cover different cases. Test cases should include:
1. Basic test with a side `a` equals 5 and height `h` equals 3 returning 7.5 (as shown in the docstring). 
2. Test with negative values.
3. Test with zero.
4. Test with `a` and `h` values that create a triangle with an area greater than zero even though the result is very close to zero to ensure float precision is handled well. 

Here is a sample test suite to accompany the above function:
```python
import pytest

def test_triangle_area_basic():
    """Test the function returns the expected area for a basic case."""
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5

def test_triangle_area_with_negative_values():
    """Test the function returns the expected area when given negative input."""
    assert triangle_area(-3, -8) == -15.0

def test_triangle_area_with_zero():
    """Test the function returns zero when given zero as input."""
    assert triangle_area(0, 0) == 0.0

def test_triangle_area_small_values():
    """Test the function handles small values correctly (float precision)."""
    assert triangle_area(0.1, 0.05) == 0.005
```

To run the tests, you can use the following command:
```bash
pytest
``` 

To run a specific test, use the following command:
```bash
pytest -k <test_name>
```

To write the test cases in a markdown file, you can use this equivalent markdown code block:
```python
```python
import pytest

def test_triangle_area_basic():
    """Test the function returns the expected area for a basic case."""
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5

def test_triangle_area_with_negative_values():
    """Test the function returns the expected area when given negative input."""
    assert triangle_area(-3, -8) == -15.0

def test_triangle_area_with_zero():
    """Test the function returns zero when given zero as input."""
    assert triangle_area(0, 0) == 0.0

def test_triangle_area_small_values():
    """Test the function handles small values correctly (float precision)."""
    assert triangle_area(0.1, 0.05) == 5e-5
```
```

This will run the tests using the pytest framework, which is installed automatically with the requirement `pytest` in the workspace. 

To run all the tests, use the command `pytest` in the command prompt while your code is staged in the workspace. 

To run a specific test, use the command `pytest -k <test_name>` where `<test_name>` is the name of the test case as it appears in the code above.  For example, to run the test case: `test_triangle_area_basic`, use the command `pytest -k test_triangle_area_basic`.  This can also be
