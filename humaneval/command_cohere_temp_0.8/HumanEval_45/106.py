```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Returns the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    Args:
        a (float): The length of a side of the triangle.
        h (float): The height of the triangle.
    Returns:
        float: The area of the triangle.
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

To ensure the robustness of the function, test cases should be added to cover different scenarios, such as validating input types and edge cases. These tests can be incorporated into the script using tools like pytest or unittest.

For example, adding: 
 ```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize('side,height', [
     ('5', 3), 
     (10.5, 6),
     (-2, 7),
     (0, 0)
])
def test_triangle_area(side, height):
    calculated_area = triangle_area(*map(float, [side, height]))
    assert isinstance(calculated_area, float) 

```

Enables the validation of the function against different input types and edge cases.
