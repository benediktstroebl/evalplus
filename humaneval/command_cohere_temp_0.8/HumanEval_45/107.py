```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculate the area of a triangle given the length of a side and its height.
    """
    pi = 3.14159
    area = (pi / 2) * a * h
    return area
```
The function `triangle_area` takes two parameters, `a` and `h`, representing the length of a side and the height of the triangle, respectively. It calculates the area of the triangle using the formula (`(pi / 2) * a * h`) and returns the area. Make sure to have the Python math library installed to use the `pi` constant. You can do it with the following command: 
```bash
pip install mathplotlib
``` 
This command installs the `mathplotlib` library that contains the `pi` constant.
