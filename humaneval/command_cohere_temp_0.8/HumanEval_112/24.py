```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    """
    Removes characters from s that are in c, then checks if the result is a palindrome.
    """
    s = [char for char in s if char not in c]
    return s, s == s[::-1]
```

This Python script defines a function called `reverse_delete` which takes two strings as input, `s` and `c`, and returns a tuple containing two values: a modified version of the input string `s` where all characters that are present in `c` have been removed, and a boolean value indicating whether the modified string is a palindrome. The palindrome status is determined by checking whether the modified string is equal to its reverse. This is done using Python's slice notation, `s[::-1]`, which reverses a string. The filtering of characters from `s` is accomplished through a list comprehension, `s = [char for char in s if char not in c]`, which removes characters that are present in `c` from the list that represents the string `s`. The comments within the function describe these steps, clarifying the purpose of the function and how it achieves the task. 

This solution is efficient with time and memory, making it suitable for a variety of scenarios.  It also effectively utilizes Python's string and list manipulation features to accomplish the required task, making it a concise and elegant solution.
