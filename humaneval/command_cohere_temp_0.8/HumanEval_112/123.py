```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    """
    Deletes characters in 's' that are present in 'c', and checks if the resulting string is a palindrome.
    """
    s = [char for char in s if char not in c]
    return s, s == s[::-1]
```

This Python script defines a function called `reverse_delete` which takes two strings as input, `s` and `c`, and returns a tuple containing the modified string `s` with all characters deleted that are present in `c`, and a boolean indicating whether the modified string is a palindrome. The deletion is performed using a list comprehension, and the palindrome check is done by comparing the modified string to its reverse using slicing. The code is encapsulated in a function with a docstring for clarity and readability.
