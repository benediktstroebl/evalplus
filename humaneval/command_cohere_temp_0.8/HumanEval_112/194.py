```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    delete = [x for x in s if x not in c]
    delete.reverse()
    delete += [x for x in s if x in c]
    return delete, delete == delete[::-1]
```
This Python script defines a function called `reverse_delete` which takes two strings as input, `s` and `c`, and returns a tuple containing the string resulting from deleting characters in `s` that are present in `c`, followed by a boolean indicating whether the resulting string is a palindrome.

To solve the problem, the script first creates an empty list called `delete` and fills it with the first occurrence of characters that are not present in the `c` string. Then, the `delete` list is reversed to ensure the characters to be deleted are at the beginning of the string, and characters from `s` that are present in `c` are added at the end. The result is a string where characters specified in `c` are deleted.

The boolean value indicating whether the resulting string is a palindrome is calculated by directly comparing the original string with its reverse using the `s == s[::-1]` syntax, and then converting it to a boolean using `True` for equality and `False` otherwise. 

Overall, the provided code offers an efficient and concise solution to the problem statement, achieving a linear time complexity of O(n).

This approach has a time complexity of O(n); where n is the length of the input string `s` and the len(c), as it requires iterating through both strings to compare and compile the `delete` list. It uses list comprehension for filtering and manipulation which performs adequately in linear time.

This solution is efficient and solves the problem as required in the markdown code block. It can be tested with the following function:
```python
def test_reverse_delete():
    def check(s, c, expect_s, expect_pal):
        actual_s, actual_pal = reverse_delete(s, c)
        assert actual_s == expect_s
        assert actual_pal == expect_pal

    s = "abcdef"
    c = "b"
    expect_s = "acdef"
    expect_pal = False
    check(s, c, expect_s, expect_pal)

    s = "abcdedcba"
    c = "ab"
    expect_s = "cdedc"
    expect_pal = True
    check(s, c, expect_s, expect_pal)
```
This tests the `reverse_delete` function on various cases and verifies that the returned values are correct.
