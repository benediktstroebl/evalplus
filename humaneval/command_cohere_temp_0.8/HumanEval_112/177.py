```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    s = [x for x in s if x not in c]
    s = ''.join(s)
    return s, s == s[::-1]
```
The provided Python script defines a function named `reverse_delete` that takes two strings as input, `s` and `c`. This function performs two main steps:
1. Character Deletion: It creates a list version of `s` and uses a list comprehension to remove any characters that are present in `c`. This effectively deletes all occurrences of characters in `s` that are also present in `c`.
2. Palindrome Check: After deleting the characters from `s`, it joins the remaining characters back into a single string. The result is a string that contains only the characters from `s` that are not present in `c`.

Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the modified string and a boolean value. The boolean value is `True` if the resulting string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward), and `False` otherwise. This behavior is precisely as described in the Problem Statement. 

This script successfully addresses the task outlined in the markdown code block and will produce the desired results when provided with valid input.
