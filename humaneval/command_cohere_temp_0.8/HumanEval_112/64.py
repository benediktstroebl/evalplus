```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    s = [x for x in s if x not in c]
    s = ''.join(s)
    return s, s == s[::-1]
```
The `reverse_delete` function above takes two strings, `s` and `c`, as input and returns a tuple containing the modified string `s` and a boolean indicating whether the modified string is a palindrome. To solve the problem, the following steps were taken:
1. Use a list comprehension to delete characters from string `s` that are present in string `c`. This step creates a new string, `s`, without the deleted characters.
2. Join the modified list `s` into a string, and then return it together with a boolean indicating whether it is a palindrome, achieved by checking if the result string is the same when reading forward and backward.

This problem can be solved with just a few lines of code, demonstrating the power and simplicity of Python for string manipulation and problem-solving. And while this solution works for positive cases, it assumes that the input strings are valid and potentially overlooks edge cases that could be addressed with additional checks for `None` or `""` inputs. 

This simple approach makes it easier to focus on the problem at hand and showcase the efficiency and elegance of Python solutions. Let's verify the correctness of the solution with some test cases:
```python
# Test Case 1
input_s = "abcde"
input_c = "ae"
expected_result = ('bcd', False)
test_result = reverse_delete(input_s, input_c)

print(test_result == expected_result)  # Output: True

# Test Case 2
input_s = "abcdef"
input_c = "b"
expected_result = ('acdef', False)
test_result = reverse_delete(input_s, input_c)

print(test_result == expected_result)  # Output: True

# Test Case 3
input_s = "abcdedcba"
input_c = "ab"
expected_result = ('cdedc', True)
test_result = reverse_delete(input_s, input_c)

print(test_result == expected_result)  # Output: True
```

The test cases ensure that the function correctly reverses deletes characters and determines if the resulting string is a palindrome, helping verify the integrity of the solution.  This integrated testing methodology makes the code more robust and reliable, ensuring it works across different scenarios and helping to identify any areas where the solution can be improved or made more efficient.  In this case, the current solution is already concise and effective in solving the problem.
