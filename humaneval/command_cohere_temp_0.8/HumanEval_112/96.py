```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    delete = [char for char in c]
    result = ''.join([char for char in s if char not in delete])
    return result, result == result[::-1]
```
This Python script defines a function called `reverse_delete` taking two string parameters, `s` and `c`. This function performs a character-based deletion on string `s`, wherein all characters present in `c` are removed. This results in a new string, which is then checked to determine if it is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward). The function returns a tuple containing the result string and a boolean value (True or False) indicating the palindrome status of the modified string. 

Here is an example usage of this function:
```python
result, palindrome_status = reverse_delete("abcde", "ae")
print(result)  # Output: bcd
print(palindrome_status)  # Output: False
```
This will delete the characters 'a' and 'e' from the string 'abcde', resulting in 'bcd', and then return False since the modified string is not a palindrome. 

This approach uses list comprehension to generate a list of characters to be deleted and then uses a join function to merge the list back into a string, resulting in the desired deletion. The palindrome status is checked using slicing notation ([::-1]) to reverse the string and compare it with the original modified string. 

This solution is efficient and well-structured, capable of handling intricate scenarios, and can be adapted to solve similar problems.
