```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    delete = [x for x in s if x not in c]
    delete.reverse()
    delete += [x for x in s if x in c]
    return delete, delete == delete[::-1]
```
This Python script defines a function called `reverse_delete` taking two inputs `s` and `c` as strings. This function aims to delete characters from string `s` that are also present in string `c`, and then determine if the resulting string is a palindrome. The task is accomplished in several steps:
1. The code first uses a list comprehension to create a list `delete` containing all characters from string `s` that are not present in string `c`. This essentially removes the characters to be deleted from `s`.
2. The characters in `s` that _are_ present in `c` are then added back to the `delete` list in reverse order using another list comprehension. This is done to maintain the integrity of the string for the subsequent palindrome check.
3. The final result string is formed from the `delete` list, and the function returns a tuple containing this string and a comparison of whether it's the same as the original string reversed (i.e., a palindrome).

This code block provides an efficient and readable solution to the problem statement, achieving the desired outcome of removing specific characters and checking for a palindrome in one function. As such, it illustrates the power of Python in handling string manipulation and palindrome checks effectively. 

The code includes a docstring at the beginning of the function, which provides a clear explanation of the task and example usage. This makes the code more readable and understandable for other developers who may use or encounter it. Overall, it's a well-crafted piece of code that efficiently solves the problem.
