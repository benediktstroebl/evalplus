```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    delete = [char for char in c]
    reverse = s[::-1]
    result = [char for char in s if char not in delete and char in reverse]
    return result, result == result[::-1]
```
The algorithm for this solution involves deleting characters from `s` that are present in `c`, resulting in a modified string `result`. To check if `result` is a palindrome, it is reversed and then compared to the original. The function returns the `result` and a boolean indicating whether it is a palindrome. 

This algorithm has a time complexity of `O(n + m)`, where `n` is the length of `s` and `m` is the length of `c`, as it requires deleting characters from `s` once and scanning it once, and scanning `c` once. 

```python
def test_reverse_delete():
    assert reverse_delete("abcdef", "b") == ('acdef', False)
    assert reverse_delete("abcde", "ae") == ('bcd', False)
    assert reverse_delete("abcdedcba", "ab") == ('cdedc', True)
    assert reverse_delete("car", "ar") == ('c", True)
    assert reverse_delete("abcd", "abcd") == ('", True)
```
