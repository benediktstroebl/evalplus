```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    delete = [char for char in c]
    reverse = s[::-1]
    result = [char for char in s if char not in delete and char in reverse]
    return result, result == result[::-1]
```

The problem asks us to create a function `reverse_delete(s, c)` that takes two strings as input, `s` and `c`, and returns a tuple containing a modified version of `s` and a boolean indicating whether the modified string is a palindrome. 

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:
1. `delete = [char for char in c]` creates a list of all the characters in the second string `c`.
2. `reverse = s[::-1]` creates a reversed version of the main string `s` and stores it in the `reverse` variable.
3. `result = [char for char in s if char not in delete and char in reverse]` goes through the main string `s` and checks two conditions for each character `char`:
    - Whether `char` is not in the list of characters to delete (`delete`).
    - Whether `char` is in the reversed version of the original string (`reverse`).

If both conditions are true, the character is added to the `result` string. The final `result` string is the string `s` with all the characters that are present in `s` but not in `c`, and the reverse of the modified string is still a palindrome. 

The final result is returned as a tuple of the `result` string and a boolean indicating whether the modified string is a palindrome.
