```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    s = list(s)
    c = set(c)
    for char in c:
        s.remove(char)
    s = ''.join(s)
    if s == s[::-1]:
        return s, True
    else:
        return s, False
```
The given Python script defines a function `reverse_delete` that takes two strings, `s` and `c`, as input. It removes characters from string `s` that are present in `c` and then checks if the modified string is a palindrome. The function returns a tuple containing the modified string and a boolean value indicating whether it is a palindrome.

Here is a breakdown of how the script works:
1. The input strings `s` and `c` are converted into lists and sets, respectively, to facilitate their manipulation.
2. A for loop is used to iterate through each character in the set `c`. As each character `char` is encountered, it is removed from the list `s` using the `remove` method.
3. After processing all characters in `c`, the list `s` is joined back into a string, resulting in a modified string where characters in `c` have been removed.
4. The script then checks whether the modified string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse using slicing notation `[::-1]`. If the modified string is equal to its reverse, it returns a tuple `(s, True)` indicating the modified string and the truth value `True`. Otherwise, it returns a tuple `(s, False)` indicating the modified string and the truth value `False`.

The script is self-contained, meaning it does not rely on any external variables or functions other than those explicitly defined within the function. It is designed to efficiently handle string manipulation and palindrome checks, making it suitable for solving the specified problem statement.
