```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    # Resultant string after deletion of characters in s that are equal to any character in c
    result = [char for char in s if char not in c]

    # Check if the remaining string is a palindrome
    return ''.join(result), result == result[::-1]
```

This approach uses list comprehension to filter the characters of the input string `s` that are not part of the Characters `c`. The resultant truth value for whether the string is a palindrome is obtained by zipping the result with its reverse.
