```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    delete = [x for x in s if x not in c]
    delete.reverse()
    delete += [x for x in s if x in c]
    return delete, delete == delete[::-1]
```
This Python script provides a function called `reverse_delete`, which takes two strings as input, `s` and `c`, and performs a series of operations to transform `s` based on `c`. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the process:
1. **List Comprehension for Deletion:** The function starts by creating a new list called `delete` using a list comprehension. It populates this list with characters from `s` that are not present in `c`. This essentially removes characters that are common in both strings.
2. **Reverse the Remaining Characters:** After creating the `delete` list, the function then reverses this list using the `reverse` method. This step is crucial because it rearranges the remaining characters in reverse order.
3. **Add Deleted Characters Back:** Afterwards, the function appends to the `delete` list all the characters that were originally in `s` but were deleted earlier (i.e., the characters that were present in `c`). Appending these characters in reverse order after the reversal ensures that they are inserted at the correct positions.
4. **Return the Result:** Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the `delete` list and a comparison of whether the resulting string (`delete`) is a palindrome. The comparison is done by checking whether `delete` is equal to its reverse (`delete[::-1]`), which is a common method for detecting palindromes in Python.

The purpose of this complex sequence of operations is to delete characters from `s` that are also present in `c`, and then determine if the modified string (`delete`) is a palindrome. The function essentially removes redundant characters from `s` while checking if the remaining characters still form a palindrome. This problem showcases the complexity of string manipulation in Python and demonstrates the use of advanced list comprehension and string manipulation techniques.
