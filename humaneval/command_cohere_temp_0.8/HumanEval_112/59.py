```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    """
    Removes characters from s that are present in c, then checks if the resulting string is a palindrome.
    """
    s = [x for x in s if x not in c]
    return s, s == s[::-1]
```

This Python script defines a function called `reverse_delete` which takes two strings as input, `s` and `c`. This function removes characters from string `s` that are present in string `c`. Afterwards, it checks whether the modified string `s` is a palindrome, and returns a tuple consisting of the modified string `s` and a boolean value indicating whether `s` is a palindrome. The boolean value is `True` if the modified string `s` is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise. 

The time complexity of this code is O(n m), where `n` and `m` are the lengths of the strings `s` and `c` respectively. The space complexity is O(1) because the function does not require any additional space. 

This code does not require any additional libraries and can be run as a standalone Python script.
