```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    # Remove characters in 's' that are present in 'c'
    s = [c for c in s if c not in c]

    # Check if the resulting string is a palindrome
    return (s, s == s[::-1])
```

This Python script defines a function `reverse_delete` takes two strings, `s` and `c`, as input, it removes characters from string `s` that are present in string `c`, effectively deleting those characters. The function creates a new string `s` where each character is accepted if it isn't in `c`, this guarantees that any character deleted from `s` will not be equal to any character in `c`. The function then returns a tuple containing the modified string `s` and a boolean value indicating whether `s` is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). The behavior resembles a reverse-delete keyboard shortcut, where characters deleted are displayed reversely. 

This solution benefits from Python's string manipulation capabilities and functional programming approach, making the code concise and readable while efficiently solving the task.

The problem is solved by using Python's list comprehension to filter out the characters in `s` that are also present in `c`. The resulting string, `s`, is then compared to its reverse (`s[::-1]`) to determine if it's a palindrome. The function returns a tuple containing the resulting string and a boolean value indicating whether it's a palindrome.

This solution is efficient because it only requires one pass over the input strings `s` and `c` to perform the desired actions. Also, it benefits from Python's built-in comparisons and doesn't require additional space for storing intermediate results. Therefore, its time and space complexity is O(N), where N represents the length of the input strings.

To ensure that the function works correctly for all permutations of `s` and `c`, potential bugs, and edge cases, you can unit test the function using different inputs. Here's an example:
```python
import unittest

def reverse_delete(s, c):
    # Remove characters in 's' that are present in 'c'
    s = [c for c in s if c not in c]

    # Check if the resulting string is a palindrome
    return (s, s == s[::-1])

        self.assertEqual(reverse_delete("abc", "abc"), ('', True))

        self.assertEqual(reverse_delete("", "a"), ('', True))
