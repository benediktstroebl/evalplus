```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    # Filter and delete characters in s that are in c
    s = ''.join([x for x in s if x not in c])
    
    # Check if the resulting string is a palindrome
    return (s, s == s[::-1])
```
The provided Python script defines a function `reverse_delete` that takes two strings, `s` and `c`, as input. This function removes characters from string `s` that are present in string `c` and then checks whether the modified string `s` is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward and forward. The function returns a tuple containing the modified string `s` and a boolean value indicating whether `s` is a palindrome. The behavior of the function is illustrated through an example usage scenario, where the function is applied to specific input values and the resulting values are displayed.

The given example demonstrates the task clearly, and the function encapsulates the logic needed to achieve the desired outcome. However, it's worth noting that the code doesn't make use of any sophisticated optimizations or potential improvements, but is straightforward and gets the job done. If you were to optimize it further, you might want to consider applying a similar approach to substrings of `s` for palindrome checking, instead of the entire string, but that would complicate the code structure. Overall, the provided solution offers a clear and understandable implementation of the problem's requirements.
