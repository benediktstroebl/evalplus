```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    # Filter s to remove characters in c
    s = ''.join(x for x in s if x not in c)
    
    # Check if the resulting string is a palindrome
    return s, s == s[::-1]
```
The provided Python script defines a function `reverse_delete` taking two strings `s` and `c` as input, aiming to eliminate characters from `s` that are present in `c`, and then determining if the modified string is a palindrome. The function returns a tuple containing the processed string and a boolean value (True if palindrome, False otherwise).

Here's a breakdown of the code within the function:
1. **String Filtering**: The line `s = ''.join(x for x in s if x not in c)` employs a list comprehension to remove all characters from string `s` that are present in string `c`. This step effectively eliminates characters in `s` that match those in `c`.
2. **Palindrome Check**: After removing the characters, the function returns a tuple consisting of the modified string `s` and a boolean value. The boolean value is `True` if the processed string reads the same backward as forward (is a palindrome), and `False` otherwise.

This approach ensures that the function both removes matching characters from `s` and determines whether the modified string is a palindrome, returning the result as a tuple.
