```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    delete = [x for x in s if x not in c]
    delete.reverse()
    delete += [x for x in s if x in c]
    return delete, delete == delete[::-1]
```
This Python script defines a function called `reverse_delete` which takes two strings as input, `s` and `c`. This function deletes characters from string `s` that are present in string `c`, and then checks whether the resulting string is a palindrome. The function returns a tuple containing the deleted string `delete` and a boolean value indicating whether the deleted string is a palindrome.
