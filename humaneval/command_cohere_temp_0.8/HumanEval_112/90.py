```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    delete = [char for char in c]
    reverse = s[::-1]
    ne_delete = [char for char in delete if char not in reverse]
    result = ''.join(ne_delete)
    if result == result[::-1]:
        return result, True
    else:
        return result, False
```
The provided Python script defines a function `reverse_delete` that aims to solve a specific problem statement. This function takes two strings, `s` and `c`, as input. It removes characters from string `s` that are present in string `c`, and then checks if the modified string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward and forward. The function returns a tuple containing the modified string and a boolean value indicating whether it is a palindrome. 

To achieve this, the function uses a list comprehension to create a list of characters to delete from string `s`, which is stored in the `delete` variable. Then, it reverses the string `s` and creates another list, `ne_delete`, containing characters that are not present in the reversed string. The function joins these remaining characters into a string and checks if it's a palindrome. If it is, the function returns the modified string and `True`; otherwise, it returns the modified string and `False`. 

The example usage provided demonstrates the behavior of the function for different input scenarios, showing how certain characters are deleted, and the resulting string is checked for being a palindrome.
