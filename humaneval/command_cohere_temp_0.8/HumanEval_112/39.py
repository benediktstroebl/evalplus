```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    delete = [x for x in s if x not in c]
    delete.reverse()
    palindrome = True if delete == s else False
    return delete, palindrome
```
This Python script defines a function called `reverse_delete` which takes two arguments, `s` and `c`. This function essentially processes the string `s` to delete characters that are present in the string `c`, and then it checks whether the remaining string after deletion is a palindrome. The function returns a tuple containing the processed string and a boolean value indicating whether the remaining string is a palindrome.
