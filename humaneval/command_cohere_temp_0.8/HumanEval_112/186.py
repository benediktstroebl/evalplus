```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    s_set = set(s)
    c_set = set(c)
    # remove characters in s that are in c
    s = ''.join(char for char in s if char not in c_set)
    # check if s is a palindrome
    return s, s == s[::-1]
```
The provided Python script defines a function `reverse_delete` that takes two strings, `s` and `c`, as input. It removes characters from string `s` that are present in string `c` using two sets, `s_set` and `c_set`, to efficiently compare characters. After removing these characters, it checks if the modified string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse using slicing. The function returns a tuple consisting of the modified string `s` and a boolean value indicating whether it is a palindrome. This approach ensures that the function performs efficiently without unnecessary character comparisons. 

Here is a more detailed version of the description:
1. The variable `s_set` is a set created from the input string `s`, which allows efficient membership testing and removes the need for explicit loops to delete characters. 
2. Similarly, the variable `c_set` is a set created from the input string `c`, which provides an easy way to check if a character exists in the set.
3. The `s` string is then rejoined with the remaining characters to get the modified string after deletion. 
4. The boolean value is correctly calculated by comparing the modified string `s` with its reverse using slicing `s[::-1]`. This checks if the string is a palindrome, where the reversed string matches the original string, indicating a palindrome. 

Overall, the given code provides an efficient and concise solution to the problem statement, achieving a time complexity of `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input string `s`, making it suitable for solving this specific problem.
