```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    delete = [x for x in s if x not in c]
    delete.reverse()
    delete = delete + ['']
    if delete == delete[::-1]:
        return delete, True
    else:
        return delete, False
```
The provided Python script defines a function called `reverse_delete` taking two strings as input, `s` and `c`. This function processes the string `s` and deletes characters that appear in `c`, resulting in a modified string. It then checks whether the modified string is a palindrome, and returns a tuple consisting of the modified string and a boolean value indicating whether it's a palindrome. The behavior is exemplified across different scenarios in the accompanying tests. 
```python
def test_reverse_delete():
    assert reverse_delete("abcde", "ae") == ('bcd', False)
    assert reverse_delete("abcdef", "b") == ('acdef', False)
    assert reverse_delete("abcdedcba", "ab") == ('cdedc', True)
    assert reverse_delete("abc", "abc") == ('', True)
    assert reverse_delete("aaa", "aa") == ('', True)
```

The function utilizes lists and string slicing operations to reverse and concatenate the modified string, and the palindrome check is performed by comparing the original modified string with its reversed version.
