```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

The function `get_positive` uses a list comprehension to filter the elements of the input list `l` and returns only those elements that are greater than zero, regardless of the data type of the list elements. 

This approach ensures that the function is self-contained and does not rely on any external variables or assumptions about the input list beyond those stated in the problem. 
If needed, the function can be supplemented with a suitable description and test cases to ensure it conforms to the problem statement. 
However, as it stands, this version is ready for direct insertion into a Python environment or script that requires a function to filter positive numbers from a list. Might you want to elaborate on how to augment this function to fit a particular application or why you're seeking to tackle the general "return only positive numbers in a list" problem? Feel free to elaborate, and I'll provide you with tailored advice and programming guidance.
