```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

This Python script defines a function `get_positive` that takes a list as an input parameter and returns a new list that contains only the positive elements of the input list. This is achieved by using a list comprehension that filters out elements that satisfy the condition `x > 0`. 

This solution is concise and straightforward and achieves the functionality specified in the problem statement. 

The solution is also unit-testable, and we can write tests to validate its correctness. Below is an example of test cases that can be used to validate the `get_positive` function:
```python
# Tests for the get_positive function
def test_get_positive():
    # Test case 1
    input_list = [-1, 2, -4, 5, 6]
    expected_output = [2, 5, 6]
    assert get_positive(input_list) == expected_output

    # Test case 2
    input_list = [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]
    expected_output = [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]
    assert get_positive(input_list) == expected_output

    # Test case 3
    input_list = [0]
    expected_output = [0]
    assert get_positive(input_list) == expected_output

    # Test case 4
    input_list = [2, -2, 4, -4, 6, -6]
    expected_output = [2, 4, 6]
    assert get_positive(input_list) == expected_output

test_get_positive()
```

In the above test suite, the `test_get_positive()` function tests the `get_positive` function with different inputs and expected outputs. 

The `get_positive` function is straightforward to understand, and its purpose is clearly conveyed by the single liner of code. It is a great example of the utility of Python built-ins like `filter` and `list comprehension`. 

The tests also illustrate how we can validate the correctness of the solution by systematically testing its behavior on different input samples. 
The test cases can be further extended to handle the edge cases like empty lists, single element lists, and large random lists to further validate the function's behavior.
