```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

This Python script defines a function called `get_positive` that takes a list as an input parameter. It uses a list comprehension to filter out only the elements in the input list that are greater than zero (i.e., positive numbers). The resulting list contains only the positive numbers from the input list, and it is returned as the output of the function. 

This solution is efficient and can easily be adapted to various scenarios involving different input lists. 

You can use this code to solve your problem and run your tests. Feel free to adapt it further if needed for more complex requirements. Please let me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like additional help!
