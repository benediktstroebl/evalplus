```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

The function `get_positive` iterates over the input list `l` and uses a list comprehension to filter out only the elements that are greater than zero. The resulting list contains only the positive numbers from the input list. 

This solution is concise and straightforward, providing a clear explanation of how it works, and it is also immutable since it doesn't alter the original list but instead returns a new list with the positive values. 

If needed, I can provide some more elaborate examples or explain the filtering process with the list comprehension in more detail.
