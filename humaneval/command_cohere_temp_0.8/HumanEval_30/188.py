```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

This Python script defines a function `get_positive` that returns a list of all positive numbers in the input list. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the input list and checks if each element is greater than zero. If it is, the element is included in the resulting list. 

This solution corresponds to the problem statement and passes both test cases provided. Feel free to test it with other input lists as well!
