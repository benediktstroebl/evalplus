```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

This Python script defines a function `get_positive` that returns a list of positive numbers from an input list. It employs a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the input list (`l`). For each element `x`, it checks if `x` is greater than zero (`x > 0`). If this condition is true, the element `x` is included in the resulting list. Finally, the function returns the list of positive numbers. 

This solution is concise and achieves the goal of filtering only positive numbers from the input list.
