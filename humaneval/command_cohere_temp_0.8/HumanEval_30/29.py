```python
def get_positive(l: list) -> list:
    """Return only positive numbers in the list."""
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

This Python script defines a function `get_positive` that takes a list as an argument and returns a list of only positive numbers from the input list. The function uses a list comprehension, creating a new list with only those elements that are greater than zero.
