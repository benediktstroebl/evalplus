```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

This Python script defines a function called `get_positive` that takes a list `l` as input. Within the function, it uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element `x` in the input list `l`. For each element `x`, it checks if `x` is greater than zero (`x > 0`). If this condition is met, indicating that `x` is a positive number, it includes `x` in the resulting list.

The function then returns this filtered list containing only the positive numbers from the input list, providing a concise way to extract positive elements while ignoring any negative or zero values.
