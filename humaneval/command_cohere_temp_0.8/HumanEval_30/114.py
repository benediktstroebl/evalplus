```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

This Python script defines a function called `get_positive` that takes a list as an input parameter. It uses a list comprehension to filter out only the elements in the input list that are greater than zero (i.e., positive numbers). The result is a new list that contains only the positive numbers from the input list. 

The function is designed to work with any list that may contain positive numbers, and the result is a list of those positive numbers. It is a straightforward solution to the problem, as it explicitly states what it does and does not do (i.e., it returns positive numbers from the list).
