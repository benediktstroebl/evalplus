```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

The function `get_positive` uses a list comprehension to filter the elements of the input list `l` and returns only those elements that are greater than zero, effectively excluding any negative numbers from the output. 

This approach allows the function to focus on the desired positive values while handling any negative numbers gracefully as part of its comprehensive functionality. 

Feel free to test this code with your own input lists to verify its behavior.
