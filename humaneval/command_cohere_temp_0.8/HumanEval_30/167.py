```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

The function `get_positive` takes a list as an argument and returns a new list that contains only the positive elements of the original list. By using a list comprehension and filtering for elements that are greater than zero, the function efficiently solves the problem.
