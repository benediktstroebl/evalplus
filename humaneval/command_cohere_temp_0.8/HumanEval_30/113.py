```python
def get_positive(l: list) -> list:
    """Return only positive numbers in the list."""
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

This Python script defines a function `get_positive` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a list of all positive numbers in that list. The function achieves this using a list comprehension, filtering out elements that are not greater than zero. 

Would you like to know more about the function or have any other questions related to this problem? Feel free to ask, and I shall be glad to help.
