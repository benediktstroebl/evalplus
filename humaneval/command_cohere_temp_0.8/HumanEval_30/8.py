Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def get_positive(l):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension, which is a compact way of creating a new list based on existing lists, to filter out all positive numbers from the input list `l`. 

The resulting list contains only the positive numbers from the input list, as indicated by the problem statement. 

This implementation follows the given problem description and passes the tests described in the code block, as it correctly filters out only the positive values from the input list. 

This function is self-contained, meaning it does not rely on any external variables or functions to work correctly. You can use this code block to solve the given problem directly in your Python environment.
