```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

This Python script defines a function `get_positive` that takes a list as an input parameter and returns a new list that contains only the positive elements of the input list. This is achieved using a list comprehension, which is a concise way to create a new list by applying a conditional statement to each element of the existing list. 

The concise nature of this solution makes use of Python's built-in filtering capability, which allows you to transform a list without the need for a separate loop to filter out elements.
