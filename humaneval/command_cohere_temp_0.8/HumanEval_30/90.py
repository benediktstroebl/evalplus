```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

The function `get_positive` takes a list as an argument and returns a list of all positive numbers in that list. The Python programming language's list comprehension is used in the function's implementation to create a new list that includes only the entries in the original list that are greater than 0.

This solution is concise and efficient, utilizing Python's list comprehension to filter positive numbers from the input list. It can be easily incorporated into larger programs or scripts to filter positive numbers as needed.
