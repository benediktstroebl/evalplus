```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

The function `get_positive` iterates over the input list and uses a list comprehension to filter out only the positive numbers, returning them in a new list. This solution is concise and straightforward, achieving the goal of retrieving positive numbers from the input list.
