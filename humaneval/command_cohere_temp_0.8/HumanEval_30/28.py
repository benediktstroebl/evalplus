```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

The function utilizes a list comprehension, iterating over each element in the input list `l`. For each element `x`, it checks if `x` is greater than zero. If the condition holds true, the element is included in the resultant list that is returned.

The `if x > 0` condition ensures that only positive numbers are retained in the output list, while negative numbers and zeros are excluded. 

The function is self-contained, meaning it does not rely on any external variables or functions defined outside of its scope. It is designed to work independently, accepting a list as input and returning a list of positive numbers from that input. 

This solution adheres to the problem statement and provides an efficient way to extract positive numbers from a given list. 

The `get_positive` function is elegantly simple and does not necessitate additional documentation. It is concise, readable, and effortlessly communicates its purpose to other developers.
