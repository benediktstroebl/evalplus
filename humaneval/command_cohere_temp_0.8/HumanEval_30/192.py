```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

The function utilizes a list comprehension to filter out elements that are not positive numbers, offering a clean and concise solution. 

Such a concise approach avoids the need for a separate test suite, as the primary function directly embodies the core functionality and behavior expected from the problem statement.
