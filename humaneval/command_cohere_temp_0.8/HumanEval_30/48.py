```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

This Python script defines a function `get_positive` that returns a list containing only positive numbers from the input list. It uses a list comprehension, filtering out elements with a value greater than 0 (i.e., positive numbers). 

This solution is optimized for clarity and efficiency. Let's verify its behavior with the provided tests:
```python
# Test a list with both positive and negative numbers
l1 = [-1, 2, -4, 5, 6]
print(get_positive(l1))  # Expected output: [2, 5, 6]

# Test a list with a mixture of positive and negative numbers
l2 = [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]
print(get_positive(l2))  # Expected output: [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]
```

These test cases should print output that matches the expected output in the problem statement. The `get_positive` function is both elegant and efficient, providing a concise solution to the task.

The purpose of the `get_positive` function is to extract all positive numbers from a given list of values, regardless of whether the list contains other types of numbers or data. The function achieves this through a process known as filtering, where each element of the list is examined, and those that are greater than 0 are included in the output result. The result is a new list that contains only the positive values from the original input list.
