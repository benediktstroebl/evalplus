```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

The function `get_positive` uses a list comprehension to filter the elements of the input list `l` and returns only those elements that are greater than zero. 

The function should preserve the type of the input list, so the return list is also initialized with the list keyword.

This solution is concise and efficient, and it will work for lists that might contain negative or non-numeric elements as well.
