Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def get_positive(l):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension, which is a short way of writing a for loop, to create a new list `x` containing only the positive integers from the input list `l`. It returns this new list. 

The function works as follows:
1. Function `get_positive(l)` takes a list `l` as input.
2. Using list comprehension, it creates a new list `x` by iterating through each element `x` in the input list `l`.
3. For each element `x`, it checks if the element is positive, meaning that `x > 0`.
4. If the condition is true, it means `x` is positive, so it includes this value in the new list.
5. After iterating through all elements, it returns the new list `x`, which contains only the positive numbers from the input list. 

This method is more concise and efficient than using a for loop to filter elements, demonstrating Python's elegant expressivity.

This function assumes that the input list contains only numeric values. If the list contains other data types, or if you want to handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists with only negative numbers differently, you may need to add additional checks or handling. You can adapt this function to your specific use case and desired behavior. 

This solution aligns with best practices in Python, specifically in the use of list comprehension for filtering items, which enhances readability and brevity.
