Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def get_positive(l):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension, which is a short way of scripting common list operations. It checks each element in the list `l` and returns a new list that includes only the elements that are greater than zero. 
The expected behavior of the function is illustrated in the docstring with example queries and corresponding outputs. These examples show the function's behavior when passed with different lists. 

The function is designed to be self-contained and should work as expected without any external dependencies or further modification. You can use it to solve the problem of filtering out positive numbers from a list directly in your Markdown document without any imports or additional code. 
If more elaborate preprocessing is needed to solve the problem or it is necessary to output the numbers in a specific format, this function can be extended to accommodate those requirements. It can be used as is or modified to suit the specific requirements of your problem.
