```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

This Python script defines a function `get_positive` that takes a list as an argument and returns a new list that contains only the positive elements of the original list. This is achieved by using a list comprehension that filters out elements that satisfy the condition `x > 0`. 

This solution is concise and straightforward and successfully passes the tests outlined in the original prompt. Let me know if it satisfies your requirements or if you would like me to provide any additional help.
