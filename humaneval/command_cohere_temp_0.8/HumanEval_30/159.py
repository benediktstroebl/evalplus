```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

This Python script defines a function `get_positive` that takes a list as an argument and returns a new list that contains only the positive elements of the original list. This is achieved using a list comprehension, iterating over each element in the input list and adding them to the new list if they are greater than zero. 

This solution is concise and achieves the goal of filtering out only the positive numbers from the input list.
