```python
def get_positive(l: list) -> list:
    """Return only positive numbers in the list."""
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

This Python script defines a function `get_positive` that takes a list as an argument and returns a list of only positive numbers from the input list. The function accomplishes this using a list comprehension, filtering out elements with a value greater than 0. 

Would you like to know more about the function or have any other questions related to this problem? Feel free to ask, and I shall be glad to help.
