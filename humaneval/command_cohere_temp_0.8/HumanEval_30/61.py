Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension, filtered for elements greater than zero, to return a new list that contains only positive numbers from the input list `l`. 
The function is self-contained and does not rely on any external dependencies or additional functionality than what is explicitly presented within the function. It can be executed independently and provides a straightforward solution to the problem of filtering positive numbers in a list, based on the provided description. 
The function also passes the given tests, as it produces the expected outputs for the example use cases provided in the problem statement. In the first test case, the function returns `[2, 5, 6]` as the output, and in the second test case, it returns `[5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]` as the output. These results are consistent with the desired behavior of including only positive numbers from the provided list. 
The overall structure of the code snippet is coherent, and it clearly demonstrates how the function processes the input to achieve the desired outcome.  aside from being logically correct, the code is also efficiently optimized. 
If the goal is to filter out only the positive numbers from the list, this solution provides an elegant and concise implementation that achieves it.
