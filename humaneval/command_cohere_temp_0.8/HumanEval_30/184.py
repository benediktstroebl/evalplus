```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

The function `get_positive` takes a list as an argument and returns a list of all positive numbers in that list. The `list comprehension` returns a new list with only those elements that are greater than zero. This way, the code efficiently solves the problem in a straightforward manner.
