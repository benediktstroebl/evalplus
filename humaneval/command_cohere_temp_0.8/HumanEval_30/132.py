```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

This Python script defines a function `get_positive` that takes a list as an argument and returns a new list that contains only the positive elements from the original list. This is achieved using a list comprehension, which iterates over each element in the input list and adds it to the new list if it is greater than zero. 

This solution is concise, efficient, and solves the problem as explained in the original prompt. It can be used to filter lists to contain only positive numbers, as demonstrated in the given test cases. 
If you have any lists that contain only positive numbers or only negative numbers, these could be excellent candidate lists for using this function. G
