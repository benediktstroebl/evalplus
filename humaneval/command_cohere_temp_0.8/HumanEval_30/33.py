```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

This Python script defines a function called `get_positive` that takes a list as an input parameter. It uses a list comprehension to filter out only the elements in the input list that are greater than zero (i.e., positive numbers). The resulting list contains only the positive numbers from the input list, and it is returned as the output of the function. 

This solution is concise and straightforward, efficiently isolating the positive values from the given list.
