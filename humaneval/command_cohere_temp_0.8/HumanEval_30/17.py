Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def get_positive(l):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension, which is a short way of writing a for loop, to create a new list `x` that contains only the positive integers from the original list `l`. 
The markdown code block would appear as follows:
```python
def get_positive(l):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```
This does the same thing as the original function, but the comment shows what it does more explicitly, and the indentation is correct.

This function is self-contained: it does not read any additional files and does not make any external connections. 
It is also deterministic: it will produce the same output for the same input every time, and the output is not random. 

This function solves the problem of filtering out only the positive numbers from a given list in a simple and efficient manner. 

This function can be tested with the following code:
```python
# Test 1
l = [-1, 2, -4, 5, 6]
test = get_positive(l)
assert test == [2, 5, 6]

# Test 2
l = [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]
test = get_positive(l)
assert test == [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]
```
These test cases ensure that the function correctly filters out only the positive numbers from the given lists. In the above tests, the `get_positive` function is used in the asserting expressions to check if it returns the expected output.  Both tests assert that the output of the function is equal to the expected output. 
If the function returns the correct output, the assert statement does not throw an error and the test passes. 
If the function fails to return the correct output, the assert statement will throw an error and the test will fail. This is a simple example of how to test a Python function. 
The function being tested is a list filter, which is a common operation in Python. 
List comprehensions are a very elegant and concise way to perform transformations on existing lists. 

In general, list comprehensions are a very powerful tool for performing element-wise operations on lists in Python, and they are widely used for many purposes. 
This function could be improved with the addition of comments to explain its purpose and behavior in detail, as mentioned earlier.  This could make it easier for others to understand your code and use it as a teaching tool, which is especially important if you are sharing your code with others who are learning to code. 
However, the current function is still self-contained and solves the given problem in an efficient and elegant manner, which is the main goal of coding. 
I hope this help, let me know if you have any question or request!
