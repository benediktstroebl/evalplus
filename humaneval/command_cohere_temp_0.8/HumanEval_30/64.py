```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

This Python script defines a function called `get_positive` that takes a list as an input parameter. It uses a list comprehension to filter out only the elements in the input list that are greater than zero (i.e., positive numbers). The result is a new list that contains only the positive numbers from the input list.
