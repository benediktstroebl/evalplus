```python
def get_positive(l: list) -> list:
    """Return only positive numbers in the list."""
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

This Python script defines a function `get_positive` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a list of all positive numbers found in `l`. The function accomplishes this using a list comprehension and filtering out elements that are not greater than 0.
