```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

The function utilizes a list comprehension to filter out elements that are not positive numbers, offering a clean and concise solution. 

Such a concise approach avoids the use of explicit loops and conditions, making the code more readable and maintaining the spirit of the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
