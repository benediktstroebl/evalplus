```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

The function `get_positive` iterates over the input list `l` and uses a list comprehension to filter out only the elements that are greater than zero. The resulting list contains only the positive numbers from the input list. 

This solution adheres to the problem statement and provides an efficient way to extract positive numbers from a given list.
