Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension, filtered for elements greater than zero, to return a new list that contains only positive numbers from the input list `l`. 

To test this function, you can use the following:
```python
# Test case 1
assert get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6]) == [2, 5, 6]

# Test case 2
assert get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]) == [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]
```

This script will output the correct lists of positive numbers from the given input lists, as specified in the original problem description.
