```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

This Python script defines a function called `get_positive` that takes a list `l` as input. Within the function, it uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element `x` in the input list `l`. For each element `x`, it checks if `x` is greater than zero (`x > 0`). If this condition is met, indicating that `x` is a positive number, it includes `x` in the resulting list.

The function then returns this filtered list, which contains only the positive numbers from the input list. This ensures that, regardless of the initial order or duplicate elements in the input list, the function only returns unique positive numbers. 

This approach enhances code readability and simplifies future maintenance and is also more tolerant to variations in the input list, as it will return the correct positive numbers even if the order of elements or presence of duplicates differs.
