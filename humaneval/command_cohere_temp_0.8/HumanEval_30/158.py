```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]
```

The function `get_positive` uses a list comprehension to filter the elements of the input list `l` and returns only those elements that are greater than zero. 

The function should be self-contained and not rely on any external variables or assumptions about the environment, as stated in the problem statement. 

This solution adheres to the specified function signature and code block, solving the problem neatly and efficiently.

If needed, you can add additional test cases to further verify the function's behavior. Let me know if I can assist you in any way to refine the solution or provide more tailored tests!
