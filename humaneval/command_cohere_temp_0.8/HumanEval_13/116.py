def greatest_common_divisor(a, b) -> int:

The GCD algorithm leverages Euclidean Algorithm, which enables the fastest computation of GCDs of two integers a and b. This algorithm expresses the GCD as the final remainder when the larger number is divided by the smaller one. It's strongly optimized for computing GCDs of pairs of numbers. The algorithm terminates when the remainder becomes zero, at which point the divisor is the GCD. A dummy value of b = 0 is used for initial division to handle the case of b == 0, which is a requirement for the algorithm to work correctly. This approach ensures that the GCD is calculated efficiently. 

This algorithm's time complexity is O(log(min(a, b))). The number of divisions is limited by the narrower of the two numbers, hence the logarithmic time complexity. This makes the Euclidean Algorithm exceptionally efficient compared to brute-force methods that use a loop to systematically divide the larger number by the smaller one. 

The initial dummy division of b = 0 handles cases where b is zero, which would otherwise disrupt the algorithm's correctness. The correct GCD of a and 0 is always a if b is 0, regardless of the actual value of a. This is a special case of the Euclidean Algorithm.
