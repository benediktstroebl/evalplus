```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a, b) -> int:
    """ Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b """
    if a == 0:
        return b
    return greatest_common_divisor(b%a, a)
```
This code defines a Python function called `greatest_common_divisor` that takes two integers a and b as input. It aims to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two numbers. The algorithm used is the Euclidean algorithm, which recursively computes the GCD by repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller one, considering the remainder. The base case of the recursion is when the smaller number is 0, at which point the function returns the larger number, which will be the GCD. 

Here is an example usage of this function:
```python
print(greatest_common_divisor(30, 15))  # Outputs: 15
```
This will output: 15, 
The GCD of 30 and 15 is 15, 
because 15 is a divisor of both 30 and 15, and no larger number divides both 15 and 15. 

And here is a more complex example:
```python
print(greatest_common_divisor(108, 162))  # Outputs: 18
```
This will output: 18, 
the GCD of 108 and 162 is 18, 
because 18 is a common divisor of these two integers. 

The function returns the GCD of the two input integers a and b. 
This approach is highly efficient, and the function should ideally never fail due to numeric issues, given the constraints of the problem. 
It is also worth noting that this function is idempotent, meaning that it produces the same result if called multiple times with the same arguments, due to the fact that it is modeled on a recursive use of the Euclidean Algorithm, which is known to produce the same result for the same inputs, every time they are entered. 
No issues are predicted with this algorithm provided that the inputs are integers and not floating-point numbers. 
A potential drawback could be the number of recursive calls, which could increase the function's computational complexity. However, this is a concern for large integers only.  picking an integer division for the remainder is safe and avoids floating-point errors. 
Hope this helps and let me know if you have any questions or need further clarifications!
