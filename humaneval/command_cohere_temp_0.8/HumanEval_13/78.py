```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a, b) -> int:
    """ Returns the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b """
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return greatest_common_divisor(b, a % b)
```
This algorithm utilizes Euclid's Algorithm (`b == 0` is a special case where gcd(a, 0) = a). It is one of the most efficient ways to compute the gcd that often reduces the larger number's value in each iteration. This algorithm is extensively used in numerous applications requiring integer calculations, such as cryptography, finance, and computer graphics. 

Here is a corresponding test suite for the function:
```python
def test_gcd():
    """ Tests for the greatest_common_divisor function """
    assert greatest_common_divisor(3, 5) == 1
    assert greatest_common_divisor(25, 15) == 5
    assert greatest_common_divisor(0, 25) == 0
    assert greatest_common_divisor(10, 40) == 10
    assert greatest_common_divisor(123, 109) == 1
    assert greatest_common_divisor(0, 0) == 0
```
The test suite covers various cases for the function `greatest_common_divisor` and signifies the confidence in the function's correctness. 

You can use the `test_gcd` suite to validate the function's behavior against expected results, which is a crucial step in developing robust and reliable code.  Test cases for edge scenarios, like passing 0 as an argument, have been included to improve the function's resilience.  By doing so, you can ensure that the function works appropriately in numerous scenarios and refactor it with confidence knowing that the test coverage will alert you to any unintended side effects.  By executing the tests using a tool like `pytest`, you can earn confidence in your code while saving time and effort.
