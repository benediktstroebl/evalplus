```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a, b) -> int:
    """ Returns the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b """
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return greatest_common_divisor(b, a % b)
```
This recursive approach is quite efficient:
```python
def are_divisible(a, b):
    return b != 0 and a % b == 0

def test_gcd():
    assert greatest_common_divisor(3, 5) == 1
    assert greatest_common_divisor(25, 15) == 5
    assert greatest_common_divisor(51, 10) == 1
    assert greatest_common_divisor(0, 30) == 30
    assert greatest_common_divisor(120, 100) == 20
    assert greatest_common_divisor(137, 17) == 1
    assert greatest_common_divisor(1000, 100) == 20
``` 

The function `are_divisible` returns `True` if both a and b are divisible by another integer x, otherwise, it returns `False`. The `test_gcd` function executes the `greatest_common_divisor` function with different arguments and verifies if the returned values are correct. 
To pass the test suite, the code uses the `assert` statement which stops the execution of the code if the condition evaluated is False. Thus, all test cases must be updated to pass successfully.  If any of the test cases fail, the execution of the code is interrupted and the "fail" result is returned to the user.
