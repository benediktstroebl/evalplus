```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a, b) -> int:
    """ Returns the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b """
    if a == 0:
        return b
    return greatest_common_divisor(b%a, a)
```
This code defines a Python function called `greatest_common_divisor` that takes two integers a and b as input. It aims to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two numbers. The algorithm used is the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for finding the GCD of two numbers. Here's how it works:
1. Initially, the function checks if a is equal to 0. If a is 0, it means b is the only number left, so the GCD is b. In this case, the function immediately returns b.
2. If a is not 0, the function recursively calls itself, passing the arguments b%a and a. The modulo operation (b%a) effectively reduces the value of b to the remainder of the division by a. This step continues until b becomes 0, and the GCD is found in the recursive calls.

The base case of the recursion is when a is 0, where it returns b as the GCD. Otherwise, the function keeps calling itself with the updated values of b and a, gradually approaching the GCD. This algorithm is efficient because it reduces the larger problem of finding the GCD of two numbers to a series of smaller problems, each involving finding the GCD of two smaller numbers.

The function includes a docstring, which is a multi-line comment enclosed in triple quotes. It provides a concise description of the function's purpose, input, and output, making it easier for other users to understand and interpret the function's behavior.

Overall, this code provides an efficient and organized solution to find the GCD of two integers.
