```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return greatest_common_divisor(b, a % b)
```
This Python script defines a function `greatest_common_divisor` with two parameters `a` and `b`. It is a recursive function that uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers `a` and `b`. It returns the GCD of the two numbers. If `b` is zero, it returns `a` since `a` is the GCD of any number and 0. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the arguments `b` and `a % b`, which represents the remainder of the division of `a` by `b`. 

The Euclidean algorithm leverages the property that the GCD of two numbers `a` and `b` is the same as the GCD of `b` and `a % b`. This algorithm continuously extracts the common divisor until `b` becomes zero. 

The script eliminates unnecessary complexity by utilizing the intrinsic nature of the algorithm, which simplifies the solution and reduces code length. The markdown code block includes a documentation string that describes the function and provides example usage, like so:
```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a, b):
    """
    Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
    1
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
    5
    """
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return greatest_common_divisor(b, a % b)
```
This helps to understand the purpose and usage of the function and also demonstrates its behaviour on specific inputs.

This approach handles input validation and assumes that the inputs are integers, if necessary.
