```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a, b) -> int:
    """ Returns the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b """
    if a == 0:
        return b
    return greatest_common_divisor(b%a, a)
```
This version of the function uses the Euclidean algorithm for computing the GCD. The algorithm is expressed by the recursive formula b = a%b, a = b%a,..., where each letter denotes the remainder of the corresponding division. The algorithm terminates when the remainder becomes zero, yielding the GCD. 

The base case of the recursion is when a is 0, in which case the function returns b. 

The markdown block contains a testing framework for the function with two test cases that pass. 
```python
def test_gcd():
    """ Tests the greatest_common_divisor function """
    assert greatest_common_divisor(3, 5) == 1, "3 and 5 should yield 1"
    assert greatest_common_divisor(25, 15) == 5, "25 and 5 should yield 5"
```
The test_gcd function asserts that the gcd function returns 1 for the first test case and 5 for the second test case, thereby checking that the function behaves as expected. 

To run the tests, you can call the test_gcd function in your Python environment. Alternatively, you can execute the script in any Python environment to run the tests automatically.
