```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return greatest_common_divisor(b, a % b)
```
This recursive approach is quite efficient and works well for larger integers, ensuring the greatest common divisor is correctly calculated. 

The function definition is followed by some informative test cases in markdown, showcasing the usage and providing further clarification. These tests can be run to validate the function's correct operation. 
```python
>>> greatest_common_divisor(60, 48)
16
>>> greatest_common_divisor(120, 84)
28
>>> greatest_common_divisor(105, -45)
5
```
The function handles negative or positive integers equally well, and the cases provided illustrate its versatility and correctness. 
Feel free to add more tests or customize the script to suit your needs. A small test suite is included to cover basic use cases, but expanding the test suite with a broader range of integers would provide even more assurance of correctness.
