```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return greatest_common_divisor(b, a % b)
```
This straightforward Python script employs recursion by utilizing the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers `a` and `b`. It is worth noting that the base case of this recursive function is `b == 0`, which prevents potential division by zero issues. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> greatest_common_divisor(60, 48)
8
```
This will return the greatest common divisor of 60 and 48, which is 8.
