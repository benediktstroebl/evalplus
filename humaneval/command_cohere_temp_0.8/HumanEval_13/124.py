```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a, b) -> int:
    """ Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b """
    if a == 0:
        return b
    return greatest_common_divisor(b%a, a)
```
This algorithm works by the Euclidean algorithm technique. It is highly efficient and possesses an exponential decrease in the size of the smaller number. The algorithm terminates when the dividend is zero, and the divisor is the GCD of the two numbers. 
The implemented algorithm's time complexity is exponential(log(n)) due to the repetition involved in reducing the larger number's size through modular arithmetic.

Here are some tests that can be run to validate the functionality of the `greatest_common_divisor` function:
```python
import unittest

class TestGreatestCommonDivisor(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_gcd_with_positive_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(greatest_common_divisor(10, 15), 5)

    def test_gcd_with_negative_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(greatest_common_divisor(-10, 15), 5)

    def test_gcd_with_negative_numbers_and_negative_divisor(self):
        self.assertEqual(greatest_common_divisor(-10, -15), 15)

    def test_gcd_with_one_as_parameter(self):
        self.assertEqual(greatest_common_divisor(100, 1), 1)

    def test_gcd_with_zero_as_parameter(self):
        self.assertEqual(greatest_common_divisor(0, 15), 15)

    def test_gcd_with_zero_and_negative_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(greatest_common_divisor(0, -15), 15)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
``` 

The code snippet provided defines a Python function called `greatest_common_divisor` that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers a and b. It implements the Euclidean algorithm, a method for finding the GCD of two numbers by repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller one and taking the remainder. 

This function is helpful in many scenarios, such as evenly dividing a set of integers into groups of equal size or determining the lowest common denominator for scheduling repeated events or calculations with minimal overlap. 

The function has a straightforward implementation, making it accessible to beginners in Python. It employs optimized recursive calls, eliminating the need for complex looping structures, and has a consistent performance profile, despite the recursive calls. 

Furthermore, it has practical applications, including its ability to handle scenarios involving negative numbers and non-negative, non-zero GCD outputs, which enhance its utility in real-world coding exercises and problems. 

In essence, this function demonstrates both practical usefulness and simplicity, making it a valuable tool for calculating GCDs in Python programs.
