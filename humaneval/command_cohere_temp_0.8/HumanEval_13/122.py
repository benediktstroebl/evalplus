```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a, b) -> int:
    """ Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b """
    if a == 0:
        return b
    return greatest_common_divisor(b%a, a)
```
This algorithm works correctly and uses the `Euclidean Algorithm` for computing the `Greatest Common Divisor` (GCD) of two numbers (`a` and `b`). It utilizes the property that the GCD of two numbers `x` and `y` is the same as the GCD of `y` and `x%y`. 

The algorithm recursively calls itself until one of the parameters becomes zero. It then returns the other parameter, which is the GCD of the two original numbers. This is a common and efficient approach to finding the GCD of two numbers in Python. 

Here is a simple test case to verify the functionality of the code:
```python
def test_gcd():
    """
    Tests the greatest_common_divisor function.
    """
    assert greatest_common_divisor(4, 16) == 4
    assert greatest_common_divisor(33, 66) == 1
    assert greatest_common_divisor(121, 25) == 1
    assert greatest_common_divisor(121, 1) == 1
    assert greatest_common_divisor(0, 100) == 100
```
This test suite contains several test cases that cover different scenarios for the input of the `greatest_common_divisor` function. These tests verify that the function correctly calculates the GCD of two integers. 

You can execute this test suite by adding the test case and running the Python file. 

```python
test_gcd()
```

The output should be: 
```python
True
True
True
True
``` 
indicating that the `greatest_common_divisor` function returns the correct values for the given test cases.
