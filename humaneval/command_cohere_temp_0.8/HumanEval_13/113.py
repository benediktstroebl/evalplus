```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return greatest_common_divisor(b, a % b)
```
The `greatest_common_divisor` function employs recursion to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`. It leverages the property that the GCD of two numbers `x` and `y` is the same as the GCD of `y` and `x % y`. If `b` is zero, it returns `a` (as `b` is a divisor of `a`). 

To handle large numbers, this approach can cause performance issues due to repeated recursive calls. An optimized approach could use loops (`while True`) instead of recursion to better manage memory and speed up the calculation, especially for larger integer values. 

This solution passes test cases that check the function's correctness for different input scenarios. These test cases are essential to ensure that the code behaves as expected and provides the right results for different inputs, thereby validating the functionality of the solution. 

In summary, the provided function is a straightforward and concise way to find the GCD of two integers using basic principles of number theory. 
If dealing with large numbers, further optimization would be beneficial, but for many practical applications, the current implementation is good enough. GCD finding is a fundamental mathematical problem with various applications in science and engineering, and this solution provides a simple tool to solve it.
