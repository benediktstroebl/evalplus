```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a, b) -> int:
    """ Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b """
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return greatest_common_divisor(b, a % b)
```
This algorithm utilizes Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor between two integers `a` and `b`. It is efficient and has a time complexity of `O(log(min(a,b)))`. The technique uses the property that, after each iteration, the GCD will be the same as the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number. 
It is important to note that if `b` is 0, then the GCD is `a`. Hence the base case for this algorithm is `if b == 0: return a`. 

The function includes a docstring that describes its purpose, and the given tests demonstrate its correctness.  This code can be used as a standalone module to import and use the `greatest_common_divisor` function.  It can also be directly executed alongside the provided tests to verify its behavior.  The inline comments elucidate the algorithm, and the docstring provides more detailed information for understanding the function.  In summary, the code presents a practical and efficient implementation of the GCD algorithm in Python.
