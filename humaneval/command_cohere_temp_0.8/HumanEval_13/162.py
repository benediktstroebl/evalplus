```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return greatest_common_divisor(b, a % b)
```
The `greatest_common_divisor` function employs recursion to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`. It leverages the property that the GCD of two numbers `x` and `y` is the same as the GCD of `y` and `x % y`. If `b` is 0, it returns `a` (as `b` divides `a` indefinitely). This method is efficient, and the code is concise and easy to understand.
