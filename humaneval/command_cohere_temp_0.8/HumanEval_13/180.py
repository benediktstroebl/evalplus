```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return greatest_common_divisor(b, a % b)
```
The `greatest_common_divisor` function employs recursion to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`. It utilizes the Euclidean algorithm to efficiently compute the GCD. The base case of the recursion is when `b` is 0, in which case it returns `a` since `a` is the GCD of `a` and 0. For any other input, the function recursively calls itself with the arguments `b` and `a % b`, which represents the next step in the Euclidean algorithm. The recursion continues until the base case is reached, at which point the GCD is found and returned. This approach optimizes the computation of the GCD and provides an efficient solution to the problem.
