```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a, b) -> int:
    """ Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b """
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return greatest_common_divisor(b, a % b)
```
This algorithm utilizes Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor between two integers `a` and `b`. It is structurally similar to the original algorithm but includes a slight optimization. Instead of passing `a % b` as the smaller number on every second step, it passes `b` if `b` is greater than `a % b`. This optimization saves some unnecessary steps. 

The algorithm's overall time complexity is O(log(min(a, b))).

The script includes tests which check if the function correctly finds the GCD of different sets of numbers. 

For example, this test checks if the function finds the GCD of 15 and 25 correctly:
```python
def test_gcd():
    assert greatest_common_divisor(15, 25) == 5
    assert greatest_common_divisor(25, 15) == 5
``` 
This is a basic example of how to test an algorithm in Python using the `assert` statement. The `assert` statement evaluates the expression and throws an error if the expression is false. In this case, the expression is `greatest_common_divisor(15, 25) == 5` and `greatest_common_divisor(25, 15) == 5`. If the `greatest_common_divisor` function returns the correct value, these expressions will be true, and the test will pass. If not, the test will fail, generating an error, which allows you to notice incorrect results and fix them.
