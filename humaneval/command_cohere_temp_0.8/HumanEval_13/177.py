```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a, b) -> int:
    """ Returns the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b """
    if a == 0:
        return b
    return greatest_common_divisor(b%a, a)
```
This recursive approach to finding the greatest common divisor is very common and has a time complexity of O(log(min(a,b))). 

It works by the fundamental property that gcd(x,y) = gcd(y%x, x). So if we keep dividing b by a and taking the gcd until b is 0, we will have the gcd of the two numbers. 

The intrinsic time complexity of the function arises from the fact that we are repeatedly subtracting b by a (or vice versa) and taking the gcd, this results in a logarithmic time complexity.
