```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return greatest_common_divisor(b, a % b)
```
The `greatest_common_divisor` function employs recursion to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`. It leverages the property that the GCD of two numbers `x` and `y` is the same as the GCD of `y` and `x % y`, rewarding this approach with efficiency. 

Here's how it works:
1. The function is invoked with two integers, `a` and `b`.
2. If `b` is 0, implying that `a` is the GCD, the function immediately returns `a`.
3. If `b` is not 0, the function recursively calls itself, replacing `a` with `b` and `b` with `a % b`.
4. This process continues until `b` becomes 0. At this point, the value of `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`.

The algorithm is efficient because each step reduces the smaller value by dividing it with the remainder of the larger number. This process continues until the remainder becomes 0, at which point the GCD is found. 

This approach significantly reduces the number of steps required to find the GCD, making it more efficient than other algorithms, especially for large numbers.
