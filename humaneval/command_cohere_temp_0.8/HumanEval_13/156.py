```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a, b) -> int:

```
This code defines a Python function called `greatest_common_divisor` that takes two integers a and b as input. It aims to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two numbers. The algorithm used is the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for finding the GCD of two numbers.

The function first checks if a is 0. If a is 0, it means b is the only factor in common with the number 0, so the GCD is b. Otherwise, the function applies the Euclidean algorithm recursively, where it divides b by a and calculates the GCD of the remainder b%a and a. This division and recursive call continue until the remainder becomes 0, at which point the GCD is found.

The Euclidean algorithm efficiently finds the GCD by repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller one and taking the remainder. This process continues until the remainder becomes 0, indicating that the smaller number is a factor of the larger number. At each step, the smaller number is replaced by the remainder, and the process continues until the GCD is found.

The function includes a docstring that provides a brief description of the function's purpose, specifies the input parameters, and gives examples of the function's behavior for two input scenarios. These examples demonstrate the correctness of the algorithm and its ability to find the GCD of given integers a and b.
