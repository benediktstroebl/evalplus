```python
def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    s = sum([a, b, c])
    if len(set(s)) == 2 or (s[0] + s[1]) > s[2] and (s[0] + s[2]) > s[1] and (s[1] + s[2]) > s[0]:
        area = (a * b * (s[0] + s[1] + s[2]) / 2)
        return round(area, 2)
    else:
        return -1
```

The function `triangle_area` first checks if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side. If this condition is met, the function calculates the area of the triangle using the formula `[(5 * b * h) / 12]`, where `b` is the base length, and `h` is the height. The function then returns the area rounded to two decimal places. If the condition is not met, the function returns `-1` to indicate that the sides do not form a valid triangle. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(triangle_area(3, 4, 5))  # Output: 6.00
print(triangle_area(1, 2, 10))  # Output: -1
```
