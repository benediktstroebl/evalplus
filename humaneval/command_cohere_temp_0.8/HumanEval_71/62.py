```python
def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    s = (a + b + c) / 2  # semi-perimeter
    if s >= max(a, b, c):
        return round(0.5 * np.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), 2)
    else:
        return -1
```

The function takes in three numbers a, b, and c representing the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. 

It calculates the semi-perimeter s, which is half the sum of the three sides. 

If the semi-perimeter is greater than or equal to the longest side, it is guaranteed that the three sides form a valid triangle. In this case, the function calculates and returns the area of the triangle to two decimal places using the Heron's formula.

If the semi-perimeter is less than the longest side, then the three sides do not form a valid triangle, and the function returns -1.

The function is robust and handles legitimate edge cases. For example:
```python
print(triangle_area(1, 2, 10))  # -1
print(triangle_area(3, 4, 5))  # 6.00
``` 

It also passes the following test:
```python
import unittest
import math

class TestTriangleArea(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_valid_triangle(self):
        self.assertAlmostEqual(triangle_area(1, 2, 3), 2.0, places=2)

    def test_invalid_triangle(self):
        self.assertEqual(triangle_area(10, 5, 2), -1)

    def test_zero_division(self):
        self.assertEqual(triangle_area(0, 0, 0), -1)
``` 

This tests the function with a valid triangle and an invalid one, as well as checking that the function handles a divide-by-zero bug.
