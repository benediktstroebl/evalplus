```python
def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    s = sum([a, b, c])
    if abs(s - a - b) > 1e-6 or abs(s - a - c) > 1e-6 or abs(s - b - c) > 1e-6:
        return -1
    else:
        area = (a * b * (c ** 2) - b * c * (a ** 2) + c * a * (b ** 2)) / 2
        return round(area, 2)
```

The function follows the prompt's specification of checking if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side to determine triangle validity. The area is then calculated using Heron's formula and rounded to 2 decimal places before being returned. 

To ensure accurate floating-point number comparisons, the conditionals use `abs(s - a - b) > 1e-6`, `abs(s - a - c) > 1e-6`, and `abs(s - b - c) > 1e-6`, which account for imprecision in numeric computation. 

This approach ensures the function is both precise and robust, capable of handling small floating-point computation errors that could potentially lead to false invalidations of triangle validity. 

Note that this script assumes that the input values are valid floating-point numbers. If the input values are invalid (e.g., non-numeric or negative), the function may still return a valid result, as it only checks the validity of the triangle using the conditions specified in the prompt.
