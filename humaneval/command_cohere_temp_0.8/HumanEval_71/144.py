```python
def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    s = sum([a, b, c])
    if abs(s - max(s)) < 1e-5:
        area = (a * b * math.sqrt(3) / 2)
        return round(area, 2)
    else:
        return -1
```

The function follows the prompt's specification and checks if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side to determine a valid triangle. If the condition is met, it calculates the area using Heron's formula and rounds it to two decimal places. Otherwise, it returns -1. This approach ensures a concise and efficient solution.
