```python
def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    s = sum(a, b, c)
    if s == a + b or s == b + c or s == a + c:
        area = (a * b * (c ** 2 - (a ** 2) + (b ** 2) - (2 * a * b))) / 2
        return round(area, 2)
    else:
        return -1
```

The function follows the problem statement accordingly. It calculates the area of the triangle using the formula `1/2 * a * b * c` and rounds it to two decimal places when the sum of any two of the input sides is greater than the third side. When the condition is not met, the function returns -1. 

To test out the function, try calling it with different side lengths and verifying the output against the specifications mentioned in the problem statement.
