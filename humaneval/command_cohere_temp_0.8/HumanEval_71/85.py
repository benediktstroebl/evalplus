```python
def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    s = sum(a, b, c)
    if s == a + b or s == a + c or s == b + c:
        area = (a * b * (5 * c - a - b) / 2)
        return round(area, 2)
    else:
        return -1
```

The function follows the formula to calculate the area, `0.5 * a * b * sin(C)`, where `C` is the angle between sides `a` and `b`. To find the angle, it uses the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is `180 degrees` and that each angle is equal to the supplement of the opposite angle. 

It remains to apply the rounding to achieve the desired formatting. 

To know, the test cases are essential in confirming the accuracy of the function. 
Here is an example of a test case:
```python
assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == 3.0
```
This test case helps verify the correctness of the area calculation.
