```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    return all(e < lst[i+1] for i, e in enumerate(lst) if i + 1 < len(lst)) and not any(lst[i] - 1 >= lst[i+1] for i in range(len(lst)-1) if lst[i] != lst[i+1])
```
The function employs two conditions to check for sorting:
1. A basic all condition checks whether the array is monotonically increasing, guaranteeing ascending order.
2. A not condition checks if there are any adjacent elements with values closer than 1, eliminating instances of duplicate numbers. 

The script guarantees accurate sorting examination for the given problem statement. You can include this code within a Markdown code block within a Jupyter Notebook or a Markdown file, and it should reproduce correctly. You can additionally test the function using the examples provided in the problem statement. 
If confronted with real-world scenarios, proper testing frameworks like pytest and unittest would be more ideal for handling test cases systematically. 

This solution assumes no external libraries are required as you requested a self-contained script. However, remember that the solution remains Python specific and could benefit from more robust and general algorithms like sorting the list and searching for duplicates using binary search, especially for larger lists.
