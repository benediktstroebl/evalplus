```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    dups = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in dups:
            dups[num] += 1
        else:
            dups[num] = 1
    return all(dups[num] == 1 for num in dups) and all(num <= nums for num, nums in dups.items())
```

The function `is_sorted` checks for duplicates in the list using a dictionary, incrementing the count of duplicates for each repeated number and initializing with 1 for new numbers. Subsequently, it checks if all duplicate counts are 1 and that the list is sorted to verify the list is sorted with no duplicate values. The function returns True if the list is so, and False otherwise. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]))  # Outputs: True
print(is_sorted([1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]))  # Outputs: False
```
