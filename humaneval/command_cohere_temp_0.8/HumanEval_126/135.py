```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    dups = {}
    for n in lst:
        if n in dups:
            dups[n] += 1
        else:
            dups[n] = 1
    return all(dups[n] == 1 for n in dups if dups[n] != 1)
```

The function works by using a dictionary to count the occurrences of each unique element in the list. Then it checks if all non-positive dictionary values (counts) are 1, which would imply no duplicates, and hence a sorted list. 

The unit tests that can be used to validate this function are:
```python
test_cases = [
    ([5], True),
    ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], True),
    ([1, 3, 2, 4, 5], False),
    ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], True),
    ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], True),
    ([1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7], False),
    ([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4], True),
    ([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4], False),
]

for test_case, expected in test_cases:
    assert is_sorted(test_case) == expected
```
