```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    dups = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in dups:
            dups[num] += 1
        else:
            dups[num] = 1
    return all(dups[num] == 1 for num in dups if dups[num] <= 1)
```

The function uses a dictionary to count the number of times each unique item appears in the list and then checks if any of these counts are greater than 1. Therefore, it returns 'True' if the list is sorted, and 'False' otherwise. 

You can use the function by calling it and passing in a list as an argument, e.g.:
```python
print(is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Outputs: True
print(is_sorted([1, 3, 2, 4, 5]))  # Outputs: False
```
