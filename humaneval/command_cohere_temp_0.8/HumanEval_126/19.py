```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    dups = {}
    for n in lst:
        if n in dups:
            dups[n] += 1
        else:
            dups[n] = 1
    return all(dups[n] == 1 for n in dups if dups[n] != 1)
```

The function employs a simple logic to check for duplicates and determine whether the list is sorted. Using a dictionary, it tracks the occurrence of each unique element in the list. If there's a duplicate element, it checks whether it's the only duplicate in the list or not. If it's the only duplicate, the list is considered sorted. 

The following basic unit tests can be used to verify the function:
```python
# Testing the function with a list having a single element
test_list = [1]
test_result = is_sorted(test_list)
print(f"{test_list} is sorted: {test_result}")

# Testing the function with a list having multiple elements
test_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
test_result = is_sorted(test_list)
print(f"{test_list} is sorted: {test_result}")

# Testing the function with a list having multiple elements and duplicates
test_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
test_result = is_sorted(test_list)
print(f"{test_list} is sorted: {test_result}")

# Testing the function with a list having duplicates
test_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
test_result = is_sorted(test_list)
print(f"{test_list} is sorted: {test_result}")

# Testing the function with a list having multiple duplicates
test_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]
test_result = is_sorted(test_list)
print(f"{test_list} is sorted: {test_result}")
```

These tests should all return 'True' as the lists are respectively sorted, have one unique element, and contain no duplicates, or contain duplicates of elements and are still sorted. The function passes the tests accordingly.
