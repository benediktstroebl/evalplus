```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    # Count the unique elements and sort the list if it's length is greater than 1
    if len(set(lst)) > 1: 
        lst.sort()
    # Check if the list is equal to a sorted list or not
    return lst == sorted(lst)
```

This approach utilizes Python's built-in sorted() function to create a sorted version of the list. The list is compared to this sorted version through the equality test lst == sorted(lst) to determine whether the list is sorted or not. 

The tests that could be used to validate this code are:
```python
test_cases = [
    ([5], True),
    ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], True),
    ([1, 3, 2, 4, 5], False),
    ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], True),
    ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], True),
    ([1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7], False),
    ([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4], True),
    ([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4], False)
]

for test_case in test_cases:
    assert is_sorted(test_case[0]) == test_case[1]
```

To test the function, different input lists are provided along with the expected output, which is determined by the list's sorting order. The function passes or fails based on whether the returned value matches the expected value for each test case.
