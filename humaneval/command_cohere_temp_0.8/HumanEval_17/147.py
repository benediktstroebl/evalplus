This script utilizes the `re` module for regex matching and provides a function `parse_music` that takes a string input and returns a list of integers based on the provided ASCII format, incorporating whole, half, and quarter notes. It also includes a test case to validate the functionality of the `parse_music` function, ensuring it accurately parses the input string and returns the expected list of beat durations.

Please note that the code assumes the presence of the `re` module, which is included in Python's standard library, and the correct import statement is used at the beginning of the script to enable the usage of the `re.match()` function.  If this assumption holds true, you won't need to handle the `re` module separately and additionally, there is no need for a separate test script as the test case is already included within the provided code.
