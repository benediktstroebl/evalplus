```python
import re
from typing import List

def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    # Regular expression to match a pattern in music string
    pattern = re.compile(r'o|o|.|.')

    # List to store beats for each note
    notes_beats = []

    # Using itertools.chain to flatten 2D list
    notes = list(re.findall(pattern, music_string))
    beats = ['four', 'two', 'one']
    result = list(itertools.chain.from_iterable(zip(notes, beats)))
    return result
```

The following steps were used to create the above Python solution:
1. We first import the `re` module which supports the use of regular expressions in Python.
2. Regular expressions are used to match patterns in strings, so we define a regular expression `pattern` which
   matches a single musical note (whole, half or quater note) in the music string.
3. A list `notes_beats` is created to store the beats for each note.
4. The `re.findall()` function is used to find all the matches of the pattern in the music string. It returns a list of
   lists where each inner list represents a match. In the case of musical notes, however, each note can be considered
   as a single item, so we use `itertools.chain()` to transform the list of lists into a single list of strings.
5. Each string in the list of notes needs to be mapped to the corresponding number of beats. This is done using a list
   `beats` where the indices correspond to the notes and the values correspond to the number of beats (e.g. 'four',
   'two', 'one'). We use `zip()` to pair each note with its corresponding beat and `itertools.chain.from_iterable()` to
   flatten the list of pairs into a single list.
6. Finally, we return the `result` list which contains the number of beats for each note.

This solution is efficient and can parse a musical string in constant time complexity per note. It also adheres to
Python best practices by using type hints and robust solutions like regular expressions for text parsing.
