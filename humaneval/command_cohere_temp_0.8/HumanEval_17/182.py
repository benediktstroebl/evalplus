This code block implements a function called `parse_music` that takes a string as input and returns a list of integers representing the number of beats for each note based on a given syntax. The function analyzes the input string and extracts the number of beats for each note, considering various note types and their corresponding durations.

Here's a breakdown of the code:
- The `from typing import List` line imports the `List` module from the `typing` module.
- The function `parse_music` is defined, which takes a single argument `music_string` of type `str`. It returns a list of integers denoted as `List[int]`.
- `MOD = 4` defines the base duration for the whole note, which is set to 4 beats.
- `LEG = 'o|' if __web__ else 'o'` is a legend variable, which depicts the note duration notation. If the script is run on the web, it sets the legend to `'o|'` whereas, for the console, it sets it to `'o'`. This is attributed to the distinct legends for web and console interfaces.
- `beat_list` is a list that will eventually contain the parsed beats information.
- `cur_beat` is a running total of the beats, used to aggregate the length of current notes.
- `cur_note` is the number of notes of the current type. For example, if the current note is a half note (`o|`), `cur_note` will be 2, and it will increase for every half note encountered.
- The `for char in music_string:` loop iterates through every character in the input string.
  - If the character is the legend character (`LEG`), it implies a new note begins. Thus, if there was a current note, its value is appended to `beat_list` and both `cur_beat` and `cur_note` are reset to zero.
  - If the character is a dot (`'.'`), it increments `cur_note` by 1.
  - If the character is a space (`' '`), it implies a rest and behaves similarly to the legend character.
  - If the character is a hyphen (`'-'`), it means a quarter note (`|.`) lasts two beats, so `cur_note`
