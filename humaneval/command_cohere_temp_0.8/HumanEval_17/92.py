```python
from typing import List

pattern = 'o|^.-|.|^o'


def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    """ Input to this function is a string representing musical notes in a special ASCII format.
    Your task is to parse this string and return a list of integers corresponding to how many beats does each
    note last.

    Here is a legend:
    'o' - whole note, lasts four beats
    'o|' - half note, lasts two beats
    '.|' - quater note, lasts one beat

    Args:
        music_string (str): Musical string to parse

    Returns:
        List[int]: Beats for each parsed note

    >>> parse_music('o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o')
    [4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4]
    """
    RES_DICT = {
        'o': 4,
        'o|': 2,
        '.|': 1,
    }

    return [RES_DICT[curr] for curr in music_string if curr in RES_DICT]
```

The beat duration is defined in a dictionary for easy lookup and modification.

The parsing logic loops over the music string, and for each token, it checks the dictionary for its beat duration,
which is added to the resulting list. 

This approach ensures that the function is self-contained and easy to understand, achieving a linear time complexity O(n) thanks to string tokenization. It also avoids the penalty of a regex parser thanks to the dictionary-based approach. It's also easy to adjust the beat durations by simply updating the RES_DICT.
