```python
from typing import List

PATTERN = "o|o|.|"

def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    music_string = music_string.strip(' ', '\n')
    return [4 if c == 'o' else 2 if c == 'o|' else 1 for c in music_string.split('|') if c != '']
```

The beat parser works by taking a string input of musical notes and returning a list of integers representing the number of beats for each note. The special ASCII format uses 'o' for whole notes, 'o|' for half notes, and '.|' for quarter notes. The function removes any leading and trailing spaces and line breaks from the input. It then splits the string of musical notes by the vertical bars '|' using the split method. The function ignores any empty elements from splitting and converts each note to its corresponding integer value based on the pattern.

Here is an example of how to use the provided solution with the given test case:
```python
test_parse_music = '''
o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o
'''

print(parse_music(test_parse_music))
```

Expected output:
```
[4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4]
``` 
This output represents the number of beats for each corresponding note in the provided test case string.
