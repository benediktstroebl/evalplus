```python
from typing import List

PATTERN = "o|o|.|"

def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    curr_beat = 4
    for c in music_string:
        if c == 'o':
            result.append(curr_beat)
        elif c == '|':
            curr_beat /= 2
        elif c == '.':
            result.append(1)
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unexpected character {c} found in music string")
    return result
```

The algorithm of this script is simple:
1. Initialize a counter of beats to 4 (whole note)
2. For each character in the `music_string` do:
- If it is 'o' increase the beat counter by 4.
- If it is '|' divide the beat counter by 2.
- If it is '.' increase the result list by 1 (quarter note).
- Otherwise, raise a `ValueError` indicating an unexpected character. 

Here is an example usage of the script:
```python
print(parse_music('o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| o o'))
```
Which would output:
```
[4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4]
``` 

This should correctly answer the task statement. Note that the code is assuming that the input will only contain the three mentioned musical notes and any other character will raise an error.
