```python
from typing import List

pattern = 'o|^.<|o|O|.|o|'

def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    dw = {'o': 4, 'O': 4, '|': 1, '^': 2, '.': 1}
    el = music_string.strip(pattern).split(pattern)
    return [dw[el[i]] * len(el[i]) for i in range(len(el))]
```

The code utilizes a dictionary (`dw`) with ASCII characters from the legend as keys and integer values representing
how many beats each character represents. The input string is stripped of any characters not in the legend and
then split into segments containing only characters from the legend. The resulting segments are converted
to integers using the dictionary and then listed.

The output of the provided example in the problem statement is:
```python
parse_music('o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o')
[4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4]
```

Such a solution can be made more efficient (in terms of time complexity) by employing a regex pattern, as
shown in the following code:
```python
import re

def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    dw = {'o': 4, 'O': 4, '|': 1, '^': 2, '.': 1}
    pattern = re.compile(r'|'.join(dw.keys()))
    segments = re.findall(pattern, music_string)
    return [dw[el] * len(el) for el in segments]
```

Here, the sentence is processed as a whole, eliminating the need for multiple splits and concatenations. However,
this approach is slightly more complex due to the use of regular expressions. Nonetheless, it provides a more
streamlined and efficient solution to the problem.
```python
>>> parse_music('o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o')
[4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4]
```
