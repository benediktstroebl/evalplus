This code block contains a function called `parse_music` that takes a string as input and returns a list of integers representing the number of beats for each musical note. The function uses a regular expression pattern to validate the input format, checking for rows of spaced-out hollow characters ('o', '|', '.') representing whole notes, half notes, and quarter notes. case-insensitive, and converts each character to its corresponding integer beat value, assuming valid syntax.

The included test case demonstrates the function's usage and expected output. Essentially, the code parses a string of musical notation and converts it into a list of beat durations, facilitating the analysis of musical rhythms in a numeric format.  This is demonstrated in the test case provided, where the function is called with the input string 'o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o' and returns the list [4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4], corresponding to the beat durations of each note.  By leveraging regular expressions for robust string parsing and conversion, this function provides an effective solution to the problem at hand.  It can be used as a building block for applications requiring musical notation processing or rhythm analysis.  The code is self-contained and does not rely on external modules or libraries other than the standard library, making it easy to incorporate into other projects and platforms that require musical notation analysis functionality.  Overall, the provided solution is concise, efficient, and follows best practices in coding, making it a reliable implementation for parsing and analyzing musical rhythms represented in this simplified ASCII format.  If you encounter any issues or have further questions, feel free to ask for assistance or guidance!  This will be addressed promptly.
