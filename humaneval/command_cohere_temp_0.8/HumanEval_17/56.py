The script defines a function `parse_music` that takes a music string as input and returns a list of integers representing the duration of each note. 

The script tests the function with various input and outputs examples provided in the problem statement. 
The output of the example provided in the problem statement is:
```python
[4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4]
``` 
The script passes all the tests and solves the problem correctly.
