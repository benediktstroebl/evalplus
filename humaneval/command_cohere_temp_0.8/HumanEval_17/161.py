```python
from typing import List

def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    beat_dict = {'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '.': 1}
    beats = []
    
    current_beat = 0
    for char in music_string:
        if char in beat_dict:
            current_beat += beat_dict[char]
        else:
            beats.append(current_beat)
            current_beat = 0
    
    # Add the last beat if any
    if current_beat > 0:

The Beat Dictionary is used to associate the various musical notation characters with their respective beat lengths. You can refer to the docstring of the provided implementation for more details on the syntax of the input musical strings.
