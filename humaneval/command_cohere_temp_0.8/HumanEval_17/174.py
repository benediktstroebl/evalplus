```python
from typing import List

def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    beat_map = {'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '.|': 1}
    beats = []
    
    current_beat = 0
    for note in music_string:
        if note in beat_map:
            current_beat += beat_map[note]
        else:
            beats.append(current_beat)
            current_beat = 0
    
    beats.append(current_beat)
    return beats
``` 

This script defines a function `parse_music` that takes a string representation of musical notes in the specified format as input and returns a list of integers representing the number of beats for each note. 

The beat map is initialized with the mapping of each musical symbol to its corresponding number of beats. The function iterates through the symbols of the input music string, accumulates the beats using the beat map, and appends the accumulated beats to the beats list. For intervals fewer than 4 beats, the accumulated beats are appended to the list after each note. And after processing all symbols of the input string, the final aggregate beat count is appended to the list and returned. 

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```python
beats = parse_music('o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o')
print(beats)
```

This will output:
```
[4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4]
```
