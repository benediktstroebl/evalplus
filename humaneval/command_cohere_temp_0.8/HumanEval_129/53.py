```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    N = len(grid)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * N for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            dp[0][i] = grid[i][j]
    for length in range(1, k + 1):
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(N):
                dp[length][i] = min(dp[length][i], dp[length - 1][i])
                for nei in [(i - 1, j), (i + 1, j), (i, j - 1), (i, j + 1)]:
                    if 0 <= nei[0] < N and 0 <= nei[1] < N:
                        dp[length][i] = min(dp[length][i], dp[length - 1][nei[0]] + grid[nei[0]][nei[1]])
    return dp[k][0]
``` 

The DP matrix `dp` stores the minimum cost to reach each cell on or before length `k`. We initialize `dp[0][i]` with the value of the cell `[i][j]` for each `i` and `j` owing to the requirement that the shortest path of length 0 consisting of a single cell is always possible. Then, we iterate through each length from 1 to `k` and fill in the appropriate `dp` values. When computing `dp[length][i]`, we consider the cell itself and also its four neighbors (`nei`). To do this, we compute the minimum of `dp[length - 1][i]` and `dp[length - 1][nei[0]] + grid[nei[0]][nei[1]]` which corresponds to the minimum cost of reaching the cell `[i][j]` through its neighbor `[nei[0]][nei[1]]` at length `length - 1`.

Finally, we return `dp[k][0]` which corresponds to the minimum cost of traversing a path of length `k` from the first row and column. 

This approach has a time complexity of `O(N^2)` since we have N^2 cells in the grid and each cell is considered O(N) times in the `for` loops. The space complexity is also `O(N^2)` due to the 2D DP array `dp` of size `(k + 1) x N^2`.
