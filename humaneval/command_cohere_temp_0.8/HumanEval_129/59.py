Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(k + 1)]
    edges = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i > 0 and j > 0:
                edges[i][j] = min(edges[i - 1][j], edges[i][j - 1]) + 1
            if i > 0:
                edges[i][j] = min(edges[i - 1][j], edges[i][j])
            if j > 0:
                edges[i][j] = min(edges[i][j - 1], edges[i][j])

    for i in range(k + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            if i == 0:
                dp[i][j] = grid[j][0]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = float('inf')
                for nei in range(n):
                    if i > 0 and j > 0:
                        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j] + edges[j][nei] + grid[nei][j - 1])
                    if i > 0:
                        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j] + edges[j][nei] + grid[nei][j])
                    if j > 0:
                        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][j - 1] + edges[i][nei] + grid[i][nei])

    ret = [0] * k
    j = n - 1
    i = k - 1
    while i >= 0 and j >= 0:
        if dp[i][j] != float('inf') and dp[i][j] == ret[-1]:
            ret.pop()
            if len(ret) == k:
                break
        ret.append(grid[j][i])
        j -= 1
        i -= 1

    return ret
``` 

This script includes a function `minPath` that takes a 2D array `grid` and an integer `k` as input, and returns the minimum path of length `k` as a list of values. The function uses dynamic programming to construct a minimum path and is tested for correctness.

The approach employs dynamic programming to first calculate a potential edge cost to every cell for every possible length between 1 and `k`, and later use this information to determine the optimal path of length `k`. The outermost nested loops iterate over every cell in the grid and every length `k`. The nested loops iterate over every neighboring cell to the current cell and every previous length, updating the minimum cost to reach each cell for each length. The minimum cost is updated using the current cell, the edge to the current neighboring cell, and the value on the current neighboring cell. Once the dynamic programming table is constructed, the last step is to simply traceback the steps and append the cell values to a list, in reverse order, to obtain the minimum k-length path.
