```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(k + 1):
        dp[i][0] = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            minVal = min(dp[j - 1][i - 1], dp[j - 1][i])
            for x in range(i):
                dp[j][x + 1] = min(dp[j][x + 1], minVal + grid[i - 1][x])
    ans = []
    i = k
    while i > 0:
        ans.append(grid[n - 1][i - 1])
        i -= 1
    return ans[::-1]  # Return the list in reverse order to match the spec's ordering.
```

The overall idea of the algorithm is to use dynamic programming to construct a path that traverses the grid, updating the minimum cost path ending at each cell. The final path is constructed by tracing it back from the end of the grid. Let's take a k = 2 example to illustrate:
1. dp[1][1] = 0, because you can reach cell [1][1] in 0 steps from cell [0][0].
2. dp[1][2] = min(dp[1][1], dp[0][2]), because we can either come from cell [0][1] (then the cost will be 2) or cell [0][0] (then the cost will be 1 + grid[1][2] = min(dp[1][1], dp[0][2])).
3. dp[2][3] = min(dp[2][2], dp[1][3]), because we can either come from cell [1][2] (then the cost will be 3) or cell [0][2] + grid[1][3] (then the cost will be 1 + grid[1][3] = min(dp[2][2], dp[1][3])).
4. Continue this process until k steps or the last cell is reached.

Then to find the answer, you simply reverse the order of the cells in the path since the problem statement requires the answer to be lexicographically smallest.

This solution will correctly output the minimum path in the grid as specified.
