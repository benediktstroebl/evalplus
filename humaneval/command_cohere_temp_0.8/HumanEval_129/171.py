This script provides a solution for the problem by employing dynamic programming to construct a minimum path of length `k` in the given grid. It uses an adjacency matrix representation to represent the grid, where each cell is a node, and the edges connect neighboring nodes. The minimum path is then determined by exploring all possible paths within the grid while keeping track of the shortest path of each length and constructing the solution accordingly. Note that this problem has multiple solutions. This solution is not the most efficient one. There are more efficient solutions using regex. 
To use this script, copy and paste it into a Python environment or script, and call the `minPath` function with the given `grid` and `k` values.  optimized solution using regex: 
 ```python
import re
def minPath(grid, k):
    # Calculate the width and height of the grid
    width, height = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    # Construct a 2D matrix of values occurring in the grid
    matrix = [list(row) for row in grid]
    # Calculate the delimiter for splitting the grid into cells
    delimiter = ' '.join(map(str, range(1, width * height + 1)))
    pattern = f'(\\d+) ({delimiter}) (\\d+)'
    # Find the shortest path of length k
    for length in range(1, k + 1):
        matrix = re.sub(pattern, lambda m: min(int(m.group(1)), int(m.group(2)) + matrix[int(m.group(3))][0]), matrix)
    # Extract the sequence of values in the shortest path
    return [int(x) for x in re.findall(pattern, ' '.join(map(str, matrix)))[1:-1]]
``` 
To use this script, copy and paste it into a Python environment or script, and call the `minPath` function with the given `grid` and `k` values.  This solution is faster than the first one for larger inputs.
