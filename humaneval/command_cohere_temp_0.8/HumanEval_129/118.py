The `minPath` function implements the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The DFS starts from any cell in the grid and tries to reach the k-th cell in the minimum number of steps. It uses a visited array to keep track of the visited cells and a memoization array to avoid revisiting the same cell. 

The algorithm works by exploring all possible paths from the starting cell to its neighbors. As it explores, it keeps track of the path taken and checks if the path has a length of k. If a valid path of length k is found, the algorithm backs up to the last step, removes the last added cell from the path, and returns the path. If no valid path is found, the algorithm returns an empty list. 

The above approach has a time complexity of `O(N * N * k)`, since every cell in the grid is explored, and the maximum depth of the recursion tree is `k`.
