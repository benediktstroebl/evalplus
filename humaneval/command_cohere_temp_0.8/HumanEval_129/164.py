```python

    dp = [[float('inf')] * N for _ in range(k + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(N):
            for n in range(N):
                if abs(j - n) > i:
                    continue
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j] + grid[n][j])
    ans = []
    j = N - 1
    for i in range(k, 0, -1):
        while j >= 0 and dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:

The `minPath` function uses dynamic programming to construct a minimum path of length `k` through a grid. The DP array `dp` stores the minimum cost to reach each cell in the first `k` steps, initialized with the cell at position (0, 0) having a cost of 0. The function iterates through the possible lengths of paths, ranging from 1 to `k`, and for each cell in the grid. It considers all possible neighboring cells and updates the DP cost to reach the current cell through its neighbors, choosing the minimum cost between the current path segment and the previous path segment.

Finally, the function reconstructs the minimum path by starting from the cell at position (0, N - 1) and following the path with the lowest cumulative cost stored in the DP array. It backs up to the starting cell by moving backwards from the end of the path, adding each cell's value to the `ans` list. The final result is the reversed `ans` list, which contains the values of the cells in the minimum path.
