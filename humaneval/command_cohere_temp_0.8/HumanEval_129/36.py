```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(k + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            for x in range(n):
                if grid[j][x] < grid[j][x - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][x - 1] + 1)
    ans = []
    j = k - 1
    while j >= 0:
        x = dp[j][n - 1]
        while x >= 0:
            ans.append(grid[j][x])
            x = dp[x][x - 1]
        j -= 1
    return ans[::-1]

The `minPath` function takes in two arguments, a 2D list `grid` and an integer `k`. It uses a dynamic programming approach to construct the shortest path through the grid that consists of k cells. The function iterates through each cell in the grid and for each cell, it iterates through all the possible previous cells to find the shortest path to arrive at the current cell. The shortest path is stored in the `dp` matrix, where `dp[i][j]` represents the shortest path from cell `grid[0][0]` to cell `grid[j][i]`. 

The function starts by initializing the dynamic programming matrix with `dp[0][0] = 0`, and it sets the value `dp[i][j]` to negative infinity (`float('inf')`). It then iterates through each cell in the grid and, for each cell, it iterates through all the previous cells to update the `dp` matrix with the shortest path to the current cell. 

To obtain the shortest path, the function reverses the order of the cells in the resulting path and returns the list of values of the cells. 

The provided example usage demonstrates the function using a sample grid and length of the path, and it prints the output:
```bash
[1, 2, 1]
``` 

This output corresponds to the minimum k-length path in the given grid, starting from the cell `[0, 0]`.
