Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    N = len(grid)
    visited = [set() for _ in range(N)]
    def dfs(r, c, remaining):
        if remaining == 0:
            return grid[r][c]
        if (r, c) in visited[r]:
            return float('inf')
        visited[r].add((r, c))
        minVal = float('inf')
        for nr, nc in [(r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1)]:
            if 0 <= nr < N and 0 <= nc < N and (nr, nc) != (r, c):
                minVal = min(minVal, grid[nr][nc] + dfs(nr, nc, remaining-1))
        return minVal
    return dfs(0, 0, k)
``` 

The function minPath takes a 2D array grid and an integer k as input, and returns the minimum path of length k in the grid. The function is implemented using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. At each step, the algorithm chooses the unvisited neighbor with the minimum value and adds its value to the path. The algorithm continues until the k values are added to the path.

Note that the visited set is used to prevent cycles and is used to keep track of the visited cells to ensure that the path has a length of k. The algorithm returns the list of values that make up the minimum path.
