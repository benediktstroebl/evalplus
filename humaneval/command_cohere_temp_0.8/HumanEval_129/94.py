The function `minPath` takes a 2D array `grid` and an integer `k` as input. It uses dynamic programming to construct a minimum-length path through the grid, moving to neighboring cells in each step. The path is determined based on the lexicographical ordering of the values encountered, ensuring that the answer is unique. The function returns the ordered list of values encountered on the minimum path.
