Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    N = len(grid)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * N for _ in range(k + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0
    for i in range(k + 1):
        for j in range(N):
            for nei in [-1, 0, 1]:
                if 0 <= nei < N and grid[j][nei] != grid[j][j]:
                    dp[i][nei] = min(dp[i][nei], dp[i - 1][j] + 1)
    ans = []
    j = N - 1
    for i in range(k, 0, -1):
        while j >= 0 and dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j] + 1:
            ans.append(grid[j][j])
            j = N - 1
            if len(ans) == k:
                return ans
    return ans
```

The overall idea is to use dynamic programming to track the minimum path values reachable from each cell in `dp`. We start from the bottom-right cell and move counter-clockwise to collect the minimum path values. The minimum path value to reach a cell is maintained in `dp[i][j]`, where `i` is the minimum path length, and `j` is the cell's row and column index. We initialize all values in `dp` to infinity, except for the bottom-right cell, which is initialized to 0. Then, for each `i` from `k` to 1, we iterate over each cell `j` and each neighboring cell `nei` of `j`. If the neighboring cell has a different value and the minimum path to reach `nei` is less than or equal to the minimum path to reach `j` minus one, we update the `dp` value for `nei`. When we reach the starting cell, we have found the minimum path of length `k`, so we begin moving counter-clockwise and collecting the grid values of the minimum path until we have collected `k` values. If we complete a full rotation without collecting `k` values, it means there is no valid path of length `k`, so we return an empty list. The final result is the ordered list of values visited in the minimum path.
