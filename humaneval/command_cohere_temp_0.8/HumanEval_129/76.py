Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    N = len(grid)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * N for _ in range(k + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(N):
            for nei in [(j - 1, -1), (j, 0), (j + 1, 1)]:
                nx, ny = nei
                if 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < k and grid[nx][ny] < dp[i][j]:
                    dp[i][j] = grid[nx][ny]
    return dp[k][0]
``` 

The function takes as input a 2D array `grid` and an integer `k`, and returns an array of length `k` containing the minimum path. The logic of the function is recursive, but the recursion is not explicitly written for clarity and space efficiency. The function checks all reachable cells from the current one and updates the minimum value and its coordinates in the current cell of a DP array.

Note that the DP array is initialized with infinite values, and the cells containing the minimum path are updated on the go with the shortest reachable cell. The output is the array `dp[k][0]`, which contains the minimum path of length `k`, starting from the cell `grid[0][0]`.
