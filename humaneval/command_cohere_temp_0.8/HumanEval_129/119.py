This script uses a dynamic programming approach to construct a minimum path of length `k` in the given grid. It utilizes a 2D-matrix `dp` to store the computed minimum distances from the start cell to reach each cell within `k` steps. The outermost loop iterates over steps `i` from 1 to `k`, and the nested loops iterate over the grid cells `j`. Within these loops, the code considers all possible neighboring cells of the current cell `j` and updates the minimum distance to reach each neighbor cell. The `dp[i][j]` value represents the minimum distance from the start cell to reach cell `j` in `i` steps.

After populating the `dp` matrix, the script retrieves the path by backtracking from the goal cell towards the start cell. It starts from the cell with the maximum path length of `k` and reconstructs the minimum path by following the decreasing path lengths in the `dp` matrix. The final result is an ordered list of values that the minimum path traverses, returned in reverse order since the path construction goes from the goal to the start cell.

This solution is efficient, with a time complexity of `O(N * k^2)`, where `N` is the number of rows/columns in the grid, and it ensures that the answer is unique.
