The `minPath` function implements the algorithm using dynamic programming to track the shortest path of length `k` ending at each cell. The `stack` variable is used as a stack to keep track of the current path. Cells are pushed onto the stack when they are part of the shortest path of length `k`. The `ans` variable is used to store the answer, as the last `k` cells that are pushed onto the stack are returned. The code also utilizes nested loops to check all possible paths during each step of the `dp` calculation. 

This code is relatively efficient, and the `k` dynamic programming states can be calculated in `O(N^2)` time. The nested loops also guarantee that the answer can be computed in `O(N^2)` time. The code passed all the test cases.
