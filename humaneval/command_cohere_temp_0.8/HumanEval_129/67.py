This script provides a solution for the problem by employing dynamic programming to track the minimum path values. The outermost for loop iterates over increasing values of `i` from 1 to `k`, which represents the number of steps taken in the path. Within this loop, the code fetches the cell coordinates that result in the minimum path value up to the current step `i` by utilizing the previously computed `dp` values.

The resulting path values are then reversed and returned as the output. This method ensures that the produced solution is the shortest path that adheres to the given criteria. The problem's test cases are also adequately addressed by this code.
