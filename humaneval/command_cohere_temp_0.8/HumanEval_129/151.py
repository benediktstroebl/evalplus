```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    visited = set()
    q = [(0, 0, grid[0][0])]
    while q:
        x, y, c = min(q, key=lambda xy_c: (xy_c[0] != x or xy_c[1] != y, xy_c[1], xy_c[2]))
        if len(visited) == k:
            return list(visited)
        visited.add(c)
        x += 1
        if 0 <= x < n and grid[x][y] not in visited:
            q.append((x, y, grid[x][y]))
        y += 1
        if 0 <= y < n and grid[x][y] not in visited:
            q.append((x, y, grid[x][y]))
    return []
```

The algorithm uses a greedy approach to solve the problem. It starts from the first cell in the grid and tries to extend the path in both the right and down directions. At each step, it adds the current cell value to the set of visited values. The algorithm continues until the set of visited values has a size of `k`, which represents the minimum path length.

To assist with path extension, the algorithm uses a priority queue structure (`q`) to keep track of the cells yet to be visited. The priority is based on whether the cell has been visited before and the cell's row-major order. This ensures that the algorithm explores the cells in a systematic and efficient manner.
