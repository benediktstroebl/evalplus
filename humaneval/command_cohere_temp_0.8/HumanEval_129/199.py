Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    N = len(grid)
    def dfs(r, c, path, visited, d):
        if d == k:
            ret.append(path)
            return 
        if visited[r][c]:
            return 
        visited[r][c] = True
        for nr, nc in [(r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1)]:
            if 0 <= nr < N and 0 <= nc < N and grid[nr][nc] != 0 and not visited[nr][nc]:
                dfs(nr, nc, path+[grid[nr][nc]], visited, d+1)
    ret = []
    visited = [[False] * N for _ in range(N)]
    for r in range(N):
        for c in range(N):
            if not visited[r][c]:
                dfs(r, c, [grid[r][c]], visited, 1)
    # Remove duplicates and sort by increasing order
    seen = set()
    return [sorted(path) for path in ret if list(path) not in seen and not seen.add(list(path))]
``` 

The overall idea is to use a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the grid, extending paths until they reach the desired length (k). The DFS traversal is performed starting from each unvisited cell and exploring its neighbors. Once the length of a path reaches k, it is stored in a list (`ret`) and the search backtracks. To avoid revisiting paths, a `visited` 2D array is used to keep track of explored cells and the paths themselves are stored in a list, sorted by their elements to facilitate deciding whether a longer path should replace a shorter one. Finally, to handle the constraints, the code removes duplicate paths from the final answer and sorts them by their elements in increasing order. 

The function called `minPath` takes the 2D array `grid` and the integer `k` as input and returns a list of all minimum paths that have exactly `k` elements.
