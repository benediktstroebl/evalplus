```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    dp = [None] * (n * n)
    def dfs(r, c, prev):
        if k == 0:
            return grid[r][c]
        if dp[r * n + c] != None:
            return dp[r * n + c]
        maxi = float('-inf')
        mini = float('inf')
        for nr, nc in [(r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1)]:
            if nr < 0 or nr >= n or nc < 0 or nc >= n:
                continue
            if grid[nr][nc] > maxi:
                maxi = grid[nr][nc]
                neig = (nr, nc)
        for nr, nc in [(r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1)]:
            if nr < 0 or nr >= n or nc < 0 or nc >= n:
                continue
            if grid[nr][nc] < mini:
                mini = grid[nr][nc]
                neig = (nr, nc)
        if mini == float('inf'):
            return maxi
        if prev != -1:
            dp[r * n + c] = maxi if maxi == mini else mini
            return maxi if maxi == mini else mini
        ans = dfs(nr, nc, r * n + c)

The overall idea is to use a 2D DP table with the cell (`r`, `c`) as the index. For each cell, we calculate the maximum and minimum values among its adjacent cells and store them in the DP table. We repeat this process until we reach the cell with the minimum path. A top-down approach is employed, beginning with the destination cell and gradually moving toward the starting cell. 

We utilize the DP table to keep track of the maximum and minimum adjacent cell values, and a `prev` variable to store the previous cell's index to determine the minimum path. To obtain the minimum path, we recursively call the `dfs` function starting from the source cell (`r = 0, c = 0`) with `prev` set to `-1`, and the minimum path value will be returned when the base case `k == 0` is reached. 

The code includes an example usage with a test case. Adjust the `grid` and `k` variables according to the problem statement.
