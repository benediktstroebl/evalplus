Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    N = len(grid)
    if k > N:
        return []

    # Track visited and previously seen cells for DFS
    visited = set()
    prev_seen = set()
    q = [(0, 0)]  # starting cell

    while q:
        curr_row, curr_col = q.pop() if len(q) == 1 else q.pop(-1)  # Priority for latest discovery
        visited.add((curr_row, curr_col))

        if len(visited) == k:
            return [grid[curr_row][curr_col]] + minPath(grid, k - 1, visited, prev_seen)

        # Explore each of the 4 neighbors
        for neighbor in [(curr_row - 1, curr_col), (curr_row + 1, curr_col),
                         (curr_row, curr_col - 1), (curr_row, curr_col + 1)]:
            if 0 <= neighbor[0] < N and 0 <= neighbor[1] < N:  # Check for valid position
                if grid[neighbor[0]][neighbor[1]] not in visited and grid[neighbor[0]][neighbor[1]] not in prev_seen:
                    q.append(neighbor)
                    prev_seen.add(grid[neighbor[0]][neighbor[1]])
    return []
```

The approach uses a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the grid and find the shortest path of size `k`. The function recursively explores neighbors of discovered cells while keeping track of visited cells. When a path of size `k` is discovered, its cells are returned, and the function short-circuits back to the main path. It starts the DFS from the upper-left cell, giving it priority over cells discovered later, to favor shorter paths.
