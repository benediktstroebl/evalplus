```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(k + 1):
        dp[i][0] = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            dp[j][i] = min(dp[j][i - 1], dp[j - 1][i])
            if grid[i - 1][j - 1] < dp[j][i]:
                dp[j][i] = grid[i - 1][j - 1]
    return dp[k][-1]
```

The algorithm for solving this problem involves dynamic programming. The `dp` array is used to store the smallest path ending in each cell, with `dp[0][0]` representing the smallest path of zero cells and hence necessarily containing the smallest path of any size.

The outermost loop iterates over the cells in the grid (`n`). The innermost loop iterates over the possible lengths of the path we're considering (`k + 1`). The nested loops thereby iterate over each cell and each possible path length.

For each cell and path length, we compare the smallest path ending in that cell (`dp[j][i-1]`) with the smallest possible path of length `j-1` and ending at the previous cell (`dp[j-1][i]`). If going from the previous cell to the current cell involves traversing a smaller value than the one stored in `dp[j-1][i]`, we update the value stored in `dp[j][i]` to that smaller value.

After the nested loops have finished iterating for each cell and path length, the last element of `dp[k][-1]` contains the smallest path of length `k`. This is because the dynamic programming approach ensures that for each cell and path length, `dp[j][i]` contains the smallest path ending at that cell of length `j`.

To return the smallest path, we simply return the last element in `dp[k][-1]`.
