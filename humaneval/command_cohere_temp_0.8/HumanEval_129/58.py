Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    # Initialize the dp matrix with -1 at each position
    dp = [-1] * n * n
    # Create a list to store the visited cells
    visited = []
    # Start from the left-top corner
    start_x, start_y = 0, 0
    # Find the shortest path with the length of k or less
    for _ in range(k):
        # Find an adjacent cell with the minimum value (+1 to avoid out of bounds)
        min_x, min_y = (start_x + 1, start_y) if start_x < n - 1 else (start_x, start_y + 1) if start_y < n - 1 else (
            start_x + 1, start_y + 1),
        # Update the path if a smaller path is found
        if dp[min_x][min_y] > grid[start_x][start_y]:
            dp[min_x][min_y] = grid[start_x][start_y]
            visited.append(grid[start_x][start_y])
            start_x, start_y = min_x, min_y
    # Reverse the visited list to ensure lexicographical sorting
    return visited[::-1]
```
This script includes a `minPath` function that takes a 2D array `grid` and an integer `k` as input and returns the minimum path of length `k` or less. It uses a dynamic programming approach to construct a minimum path from the left-top corner to any other cell in the grid. The `visited` list keeps track of the cells visited along the minimum path. Finally, the function returns the `visited` list in reverse order to ensure lexicographical sorting of the path values.
