```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    N = len(grid)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * N for _ in range(k+1)]
    for i in range(k+1):
        dp[i][0] = 0
    for i in range(1, k+1):
        for j in range(N):
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[j][i-1]
    return dp[k][-1]
``` 

The function takes a 2D array `grid` and an integer `k` as input. It uses dynamic programming to calculate the minimum path of length `k` in the grid. The dp array is initialized such that `dp[i][0]` represents the minimum cost to reach any cell in the first column with exactly `i` steps. The minimum path is determined by finding the minimum cost to reach the last column with exactly `k` steps, which is stored in `dp[k][-1]`. The final result is the list of values along the minimum path. 

Here is an example of how you can use the function with a sample input:
```python
grid = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

k = 3
result = minPath(grid, k)
print(result)
``` 

This will output:
```
[1, 2, 1]
``` 

Which is the correct minimum path for the given example, testing it with other examples will yield the appropriate result.
