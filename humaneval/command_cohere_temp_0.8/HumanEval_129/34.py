This script uses a dynamic programming approach to construct the shortest path of length `k` in the grid. A 2D `dp` array is filled, where `dp[i][j]` represents the shortest distance to reach point `j` from the starting point in `i` steps or fewer. The final answer is constructed using the reversed path stored in the `dp` array. Note that this approach assumes that the grid is representable as a `list[list[int]]`, where each integer represents a cell in the grid.  This solution is `O(N * K * K)`, where `N` is the number of rows/columns in the grid and `K` is the given length `k`.
