```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    N = len(grid)
    if k > N:
        return []
    dp = [float('inf')] * N
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if i == 0 or j == 0:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], grid[i][j])
            elif grid[i][j] < dp[i-1] or (grid[i][j] == dp[i-1] and grid[i][j] < dp[i-1]-1):
                dp[i] = grid[i][j]
    result = []
    for i in range(k):
        result.append(dp[0]//N)
        dp[0] -= N*result[-1]
    return result[::-1]
``` 

The solution algorithm is Lexicographical Ordering:
1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum distance to travel from the cell at position `(i, j)` to reach the boundary of the grid.
2. For each cell in the grid (excluding the edge cells), update the `dp` values:
   - If the current cell is the starting cell, update `dp[0][j]` for each column j.
   - If the current cell is not the starting cell, update `dp[i][j]` for each cell (i, j) by considering the minimum of its current value and two possibilities:
     - Moving one step towards the right (i.e., decreasing `dp[i][j]` by 1).
     - Moving one step towards the left (i.e., decreasing `dp[i-1][j]` by 1).
3. Starting from the first cell in the top-left corner, reconstruct the minimum path by iterating through the desired number of steps(k). This is done by subtracting N*value (where N is the number of columns/rows and value is the step) from the current cell's distance to the boundary.
4. The result is the reversed order of the values encountered while reconstructing the path in step 3, as the path reconstruction ensures that the minimum path is found while respecting the lexicographical order constraint.
