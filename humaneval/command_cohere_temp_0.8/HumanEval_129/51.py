Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    N = len(grid)
    if k > N:
        return []

    # Create a 2D DP array to store the minimum paths for each cell
    dp = [[[float('inf')] * (N * N + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)] for _ in range(N + 1)]

    # Initialize the base case
    for i in range(N + 1):
        dp[i][0][1] = i

    # Fill in the DP array using a bottom-up approach
    for length in range(1, k + 1):
        for i in range(N + 1):
            for j in range(N * N, 0, -1):
                if dp[i][length - 1][j] == float('inf'):
                    continue
                minIndex = i
                minValue = j
                for x in range(i):
                    if dp[x][length - 1][j] != float('inf') and dp[x][length - 1][j] < dp[i][length - 1][j]:
                        minIndex = x
                        minValue = dp[x][length - 1][j]

                dp[i][length][minValue] = minIndex

    # Find the minimum path and return its values
    minPathIndices = []
    i, j = N, N * N
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][k][j] != float('inf'):
            minPathIndices.append(dp[i][k][j])
            i, j = dp[i][k][j], 1
        else:
            j -= 1

    minPathIndices.reverse()
    return [grid[i][j] for i, j in minPathIndices]
```
This script includes a function called `minPath` that takes a 2D array `grid` and an integer `k` as input, and it efficiently computes the minimum path of length `k` using dynamic programming. The bottom-up approach is used to fill the DP array, and the final path is determined by backtracking through the DP array. The function returns the list of values along the minimum path.
