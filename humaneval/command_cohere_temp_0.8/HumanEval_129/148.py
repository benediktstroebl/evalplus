```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(k + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            for x in range(n):
                if grid[j][x] != grid[j][j]:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][x] + 1)
    ans = []
    for i in range(k, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if grid[j][n - 1] != grid[j][j]:
                if dp[i][j] == dp[i][n - 1] + 1:
                    ans.append(grid[j][n - 1])
                    j = n - 1
    reverse(ans)
    return ans

def reverse(lst):
    lst.reverse()
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            lst[i], lst[i + 1] = lst[i + 1], lst[i]
```

The algorithm for solving this problem can be outlined as follows:
1. Create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the smallest path that ends at cell `grid[j][0]` and has length `i`.
2. Initialize `dp[0][0]` to 0, and for `i` in range `[1, k + 1]` and `j` in range `[0, n - 1]` update the value as follows: 
    - `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][x] + 1)` where `x` ranges over all cells in the same row as `grid[j]` that are not 
       equal to `grid[j][j]`.
3. The final answer is the list of values that are `dp[k][n - 1] + 1` steps away from the top-left cell.

This solution leverages dynamic programming to efficiently compute the minimum path length and construct the corresponding path. The `reverse()` function is used to ensure the order of the output is correct.
