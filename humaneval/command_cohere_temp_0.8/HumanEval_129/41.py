```python

    N = len(grid)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * N for _ in range(k+1)]
    start = [i for i in range(N) if grid[i][0] == 1]
    if not start:
        return []

    for i in range(k, 0, -1):
        for j in range(N):
            for n in range(N):
                if i == k or (grid[j][n] != grid[j][n-1] and dp[i-1][n-1] > dp[i-1][j] + 1):
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][n-1] if i > 0 else 1
                    if grid[j][n] != grid[j][n-1]:
                        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j] + 1)

    ans = [0] * k
    j = start[0]
    for i in range(k):
        while j == start[0] and grid[j][0] == i + 1:
            j = (j + 1) % N

This Python script solves the problem by employing dynamic programming to track the minimum path values. It starts by initializing the dp array, with the first column representing the minimum distance to reach each cell on the grid. The script iteratively updates the dp values based on the current cell and the cell's neighbor. The result is the minimum path of length k. 
To solve this problem efficiently, the key insight is that we can use the optimal substructure of the problem. That is, the minimum distance to reach cell (i, j) is equal to the minimum distance to reach cell (i, n) for any n < j, plus one if cell (i, j) is different from cell (i, n) for some n < j. 

This code has a time complexity of O(N^2) due to the nested loops used for traversal, but it should be noted that the nested loops collectively iterate over each cell in the grid only once, making the overall time complexity optimal for this particular problem.
