The `minPath` function implements the algorithm to solve the given problem. It iterates through the cells of the grid, filling up the `dp` matrix. The `dp` matrix stores the smallest path of length `k` that ends on the respective cell, such that the path that ends on cell `j` is smaller than the path that ends on cell `nei` if `grid[j][nei]` is greater than the former's path value plus one. The final result is then traced back using the `dp` matrix to determine the minimum path of length `k`. The function returns the list of values visited along this path.
