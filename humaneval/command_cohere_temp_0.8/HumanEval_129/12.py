Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    N = len(grid)
    def dfs(r, c, path, visited, dp):
        if len(path) == k:
            return True
        if (r, c) in visited:
            return False
        visited[(r, c)] = True

        # Try moving in all 4 directions
        if dfs(r-1, c, path+[grid[r-1][c]], visited, dp) or \
           dfs(r+1, c, path+[grid[r+1][c]], visited, dp) or \
           dfs(r, c-1, path+[grid[r][c-1]], visited, dp) or \
           dfs(r, c+1, path+[grid[r][c+1]], visited, dp):
            return True

        # If none of the 4 directions leads to a valid path,
        # Then this cell cannot be part of the answer
        return False

    # Initialize
    visited = {}
    dp = [False]*(N*N)
    return [grid[0][0]] + [grid[r][c] for r, c in sorted(dfs(0, 0, [], visited, dp), key=lambda x: x[1])]
```

The function `minPath` takes the grid and the desired path length `k` as input, 
it uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to explore all possible paths, 
and intelligently picks the shortest one based on the criteria mentioned in the problem statement. 

This solution runs in O(N^2) time, where N is the number of rows/columns in the grid. 

The approach is to systematically explore all possible paths in the grid, 
keeping track of the ones that satisfy the length `k` requirement, 
and then picking the shortest one based on the ordering criteria provided. 

The ordered list of values along the minimum path is returned as the output. In the previous approach, 
the DFS is called N^2 times, which is not efficient, so we can optimize it using a 2D DP approach:
```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    # Calculate number of rows and columns
    N = len(grid)
    M = len(grid[0])

    # 2D DP to track if a path of length 'i' can start from cell [r, c]
    dp = [[False] * M for _ in range(N)]
    
    # Initialize the first column as a valid starting point for path of any length
    for r in range(N):
        dp[r][0] = True

    # Solve using 2D DP
    paths = [[None] * M for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for r in range(N):
        for c in range(M):
            if dp[r][c] and grid[r][c] not in paths[k]:
                paths[k].append(grid[r][c])
                for i in range(1, k + 1):
                    prev_col = (c - i + M) % M
                    next_col = (c + 1) % M
                    dp[r][next_col] |= dp[r][prev_col]
                    if dp[r][next_col]:
                        paths[i].append(grid[r][next_col])
    
    return paths[k]
```

The `minPath` function calculates the shortest path of a given length `k`
