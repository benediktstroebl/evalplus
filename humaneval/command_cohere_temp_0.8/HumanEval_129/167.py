Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(k + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            for x in range(n):
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][x] + grid[x][j])
    ans = []
    i, j = k - 1, n - 1
    while i >= 0 and j >= 0:
        ans.append(grid[i][j])
        i, j = i - 1, j - k
    ans.reverse()
    return ans
```

The overall idea for the minimum path algorithm is to consider the grid as a 2D plane where we have to find the shortest path that covers every cell exactly k times. This type of problem is usually solved by using the **Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm**. Our implementation creates a 2D array `dp` that holds the minimum cost to reach each cell within exactly k steps from the starting point. At the beginning, the distance to the starting cell is 0, and all others are infinity. During the algorithm, the minimum cost to reach each cell within k steps is updated k times for each cell. After the algorithm completes, we trace our steps to reconstruct the minimum path.
