Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    visited = set()
    q = [(0, 0, grid[0][0])]
    while q:
        x, y, val = q.pop()
        if len(visited) == k:
            return list(visited)
        visited.add(val)
        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:
            nex = (x + dx, y + dy)
            if 0 <= nex[0] < n and 0 <= nex[1] < n and grid[nex[0]][nex[1]] not in visited:
                q.append((nex[0], nex[1], grid[nex[0]][nex[1]]))
    return []
```

The solution uses a queue-based approach to explore the grid and track the visited cells. The function starts from any cell and iteratively adds neighboring cells to the path while avoiding duplicates. The process continues until the specified length `k` of the path is reached. The function returns the lexicographically smallest sequence of cell values encountered during the journey.
