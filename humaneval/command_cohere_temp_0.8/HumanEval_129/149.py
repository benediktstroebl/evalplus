This Python script defines a function `minPath` that solves the problem statement given a grid and a value of `k`. It uses a discrete coordinate system with the origin at the top-left corner and coordinates ordered by increasing row then column. The function initializes an array `dp` to store the best path found so far to each cell and iteratively explores neighboring cells, updating the best path stored in `dp` when a shorter path is found. It uses a queue to keep track of the cells that may have an improved path. 

The script also has corresponding test cases that ensure the function `minPath` behaves correctly for various inputs.
