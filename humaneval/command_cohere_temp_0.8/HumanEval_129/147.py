Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    N = len(grid)
    if k > N:
        return []

    def dfs(r, c, path, visited, dp):
        if len(path) == k:
            return True
        if (r, c) in visited:
            return False
        visited[r, c] = True

        for nr, nc in [(r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1)]:
            if 0 <= nr < N and 0 <= nc < N and grid[nr][nc] != path[-1] and dfs(nr, nc, path + [grid[nr][nc]], visited, dp):
                return True
                # Found a valid path, update the dp value if the found path has smaller len()
                if len(path) + 1 == k:
                    dp[r][c] = nr
                    return True

        return False

    if k == 1:
        return [grid[0][0]] if grid[0][0] != 0 else []

    dp = [[-1 for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]
    visited = [False for _ in range(N)]
    # Start the DFS from the first row and column
    row, col = next((r, c) for r in range(N) for c in range(N) if not visited[r][c])
    path = [grid[row][col]]
    if not dfs(row, col, path, visited, dp):
        return []
    # Found the shortest path, now backtrack to get the answer
    res = [grid[r][c] for r, c in reversed(dp[row]) if grid[r][c] != 0]
    return res
```
This code defines a function `minPath` that takes a 2D array `grid` and an integer `k` as input. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find a path through the grid of length `k`, following the specification you provided. The `dfs` function is used to explore different paths, and the `dp` array is used to store the best path found so far for each cell. Finally, the code backtracks to retrieve the coordinates of the cells visited during the shortest path and returns them as an ordered list.
