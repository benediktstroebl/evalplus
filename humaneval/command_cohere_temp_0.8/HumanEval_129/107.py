Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    N = len(grid)
    def dfs(r, c, path, visited, ds):
        if len(path) == k:
            return True
        if visited[r][c]:
            return False
        visited[r][c] = True
        path.append(grid[r-1][c-1])
        for dr, dc in [(0,1), (1,1), (1,0), (1,-1)]:  # four neighbors
            if 0 <= r+dr < N and 0 <= c+dc < N and grid[r+dr][c+dc] != 0 and not visited[r+dr][c+dc]:
                if dfs(r+dr, c+dc, path, visited, ds):
                    return True
                ds.append(path)
                path.pop()
                visited[r+dr][c+dc] = False
        return False
        
    ds = []
    visited = [[False for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]
    path = []
    for r in range(N):
        for c in range(N):
            if grid[r][c] != 0 and not visited[r][c] and dfs(r, c, path, visited, ds):
                return path
    return ds
```

The overall idea is to use a depth-first search (DFS) starting from any cell on the grid. At each step of the DFS, we extend the current path to one of its neighbors, ensuring that the neighbor is unvisited and that the path of this neighbor leads to a cell with a smaller value than the current one. If we successfully reach a path of length `k`, we return this path. If we reach a dead end, we backtrack and try another neighbor. To avoid infinite loops, we maintain a list of already visited grids and for each neighbor, we check if it has been visited before. 

The function calls the DFS algorithm `dfs` which explores all possible paths and keeps track of the best ones (those leading to smaller values first). The function returns the list `ds` which is the list of all possible valid paths. The path that minimizes the value is supposed to be the first one in this list.
