Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(k + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0
    for i in range(k + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            for nei in [(j, left), (j, right)]:
                if nei[0] == j:
                    continue
                nei_value = grid[nei[0]][nei[1]]
                if i + 1 < k and dp[i + 1][nei_value] != float('inf'):
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i + 1][nei_value] + 1)
                elif nei_value != n * n:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][nei_value] + 1)
    ans = []
    for i in range(k):
        ans.append(dp[i][n - 1])
    return ans

left = lambda x: x - 1
right = lambda x: x + 1
```

The overall idea is to build a potential field over the grid, such that the cost of reaching to a cell is the shortest distance from a starting point to this cell, assuming we can only move to the left, right, and the cell with the minimum distance to reach in the grid. At each cell, we have a potential field for each future cell, so in total, we will have a DP array with dimensions `(k+1) x n^2`. 

At each cell 'j' and future step 'i', we can either move to the left or right, or we can move to a neighboring cell with a minimum distance and go through it. So for each cell in the current row, we check all the left cells and all the right cells, and if the minimum distance to reach them is not infinity, we update our minimum distance for the current cell. Specifically, let's define our dictionary as `dp`:
```python
dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(k + 1)]
```
`dp[i][j]` will be the minimum number of steps to reach cell `j` in step `i`. Finally, the output is the last column of `dp` because it represents the minimum number of steps to reach the last cell in the grid, which is the cell with the minimum distance from the starting point (we are assuming we start from an arbitrary cell). 

Note that there are some optimizations that could reduce the complexity from O(N^2 k) to O(N k), but they are relatively intricate and deserve their own explanation.
