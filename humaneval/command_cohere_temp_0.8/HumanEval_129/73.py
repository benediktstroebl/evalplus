This script uses a dynamic programming approach to construct a minimum path of length `k` through a grid. It considers four possible movements to compare the cell values and determine the minimum path. It then uses the computed optimal paths to extract the desired answer.

Here are some example outputs from this function:
```
[1, 2, 1]
[1]
[2, 1, 1]
[9, 8, 7]
``` 
You can add your own test cases to the function by creating a list of grids and integers `k` and using the `assert` statement to check for expected output.
