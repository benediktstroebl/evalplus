This Python script defines a function `generate_even_digits(a, b)` that takes in two positive integers, `a` and `b`, and returns a list of even digits that lie between `a` and `b`, inclusive, and sorted in ascending order. The function checks if the start and end numbers are even, and also checks if they are in the correct order (a precedes b). If any of these conditions are not met, an empty list is returned. Otherwise, it constructs a list of even integers between `a` and `b` using a list comprehension and sorts it in ascending order.

The test cases printed in the script verify that the function behaves as expected, correctly identifying and sorting the even digits between the specified numbers, and returning an empty list if no even digits are found within the specified range. You can use this code to solve the problem statement provided.
