Here's a Python script that contains a function which fulfills the criteria mentioned in the query:
```python
def generate_even_digits(a, b):
    """
    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a and b, in ascending order.
    """
    if a % 2 or b % 2:
        return []  # Exit early if either 'a' or 'b' is odd
    integers = []
    while a <= b:
        if a % 2 == 0:
            integers.append(a)
            a += 1
        else:
            a, b = b, a - 1
    return integers

# Tests:
assert generate_even_digits(1, 20) == [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
assert generate_even_digits(10, 14) == [12, 14]
assert generate_even_digits(2, 8) == [2, 4, 6, 8]
assert generate_even_digits(8, 2) == [2, 4, 6, 8]
assert generate_even_digits(5, 5) == []
```

This code defines the `generate_even_digits()` function, which accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`. It searches for even digits between `a` and `b`, in ascending order, and subsequently returns them in a list. To optimize the process, it verifies if either `a` or `b` is odd and, if true, exits and returns an empty list since only even integers are included in the even digits. The function employs two-pointer technique (`a` and `b`) to traverse the range effectively.

The tests present assure that the function operates correctly. You can incorporate these into your codebase to validate the function performs as anticipated.
