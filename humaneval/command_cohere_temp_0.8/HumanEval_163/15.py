```python
def generate_even_digits(a, b):
    """
    Generating even digits between two numbers.
    """
    evens = []
    for x in range(a, b + 1):
        if str(x).split('0')[1] % 2 == 0:
            evens.append(x)
    return evens

# Test Cases:
print(generate_even_digits(2, 8))   # [2, 4, 6, 8]
print(generate_even_digits(8, 2))   # [2, 4, 6, 8]
print(generate_even_digits(10, 14)) # []
```

This script defines the `generate_even_digits()` function, which accepts two positive integers, `a` and `b`, and returns a list of all the even digits between `a` and `b`, in ascending order. 

The function loops through the range from `a` to `b`, checks each integer for its evenness, and appends the even ones to the `evens` list, which is then returned. 

The test cases at the end verify that the function works correctly for the given examples, returning the expected even digits as a list.
