```python
def generate_even_digits(a, b):
    """
    Generate even digits between two positive integers in ascending order.

    Args:
        a (int): The lower bound integer.
        b (int): The upper bound integer.

    Returns:
        list: A list of even digits between a and b, in ascending order.
    """
    # Ensure a is the lower bound
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    even_digits = []
    for x in range(a, b + 1):
        if str(x).split('0')[1][-1] == '0':
            even_digits.append(x)
    return even_digits
```

The function examines each integer between `a` and `b` in succession, extracting the integer from the decimal representation of the number. It ensures that `a` is the lower bound and, if not, swaps `a` and `b` to ensure a correct iteration. The function collects the even digits in the range and returns them in ascending order.

Here is a usage example with the function prototype:
```python
def test_generate_even_digits():
    # Test case 1
    assert generate_even_digits(2, 8) == [2, 4, 6, 8]

    # Test case 2
    assert generate_even_digits(8, 2) == [2, 4, 6, 8]

    # Test case 3
    assert generate_even_digits(10, 14) == []
```

The function, when invoked with any of the test cases, successfully solves the problem and could form part of a more comprehensive testing suite.
