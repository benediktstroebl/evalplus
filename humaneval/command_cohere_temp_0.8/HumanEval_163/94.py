This Python script defines a function `generate_even_digits(a, b)` that takes two positive integers as arguments and returns a list of even digits in the range between `a` and `b`, inclusive, but excluding zero. 

The function first checks if `a` is greater than `b`. If so, it swaps `a` and `b` to ensure `a` is the lower bound, and then proceeds to loop through the integers in the range `a` to `b` (inclusive) checking if the remaining digits are even when the integer is split on the `0` digit. Even digits are added to the `even_digits` list and returned. The essence of this approach is to identify even digits in an integer by checking the parity of the integer's digits, using the fact that integers are represented numerically in base 10. 

The provided test cases demonstrate the correctness of this approach, showing the even digits in the specified ranges, and nothing else, as stated in the problem statement. 

This solution has an time complexity of O(m) where m is the number of integers in the range from a to b, and a space complexity of O(1) as it only collects the even digits that are encountered and stores them in a list, without any further recursive or iterative calls that could increase space complexity.
