This script employs the `filter()` function, complemented by a `lambda` expression, to efficiently sift out even integers within the `range()` output. The resultant even digits are then consolidated and returned in ascending order.

For better code readability, I've also included a docstring that elucidates the purpose of the function, along with insightful arguments and return values. Additionally, to assure functionality, the script has incorporated test cases that are appropriately administered using the `print` function. Nonetheless, to achieve comprehensive testing, it's recommended to adopt a testing framework like `pytest`.
