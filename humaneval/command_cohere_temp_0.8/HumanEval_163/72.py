This Python script defines a function called `generate_even_digits` takes two positive integers as arguments, a and b, and returns a list of even digits in ascending order between a and b. The function initially checks if `a` is greater than `b`, and if so, it swaps them to ensure `a` is the lower bound. It then iterates through integers between `a` and `b`, adding any even digits (where the last digit of the decimal representation is 0) to the even_digits list. The function returns the list of even digits in ascending order between the specified bounds.

The test cases printed in the code demonstrate the function's behavior for different input ranges and show that it correctly solves the problem.
