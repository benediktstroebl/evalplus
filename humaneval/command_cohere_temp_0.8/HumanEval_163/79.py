This script defines a function called `generate_even_digits` that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`. The function returns a list of even digits between `a` and `b`, inclusive, provided that `a` and `b` are positive integers with differing parities and `a` is not the same as `b`. If `a` and `b` don't meet these criteria, an empty list is returned.

The function uses a list comprehension with a range generator, filtering elements that are even (with step 2) to create the desired list. The special handling for `a` and `b` ensures the function's logic is sound and returns the expected results for the given tests.
