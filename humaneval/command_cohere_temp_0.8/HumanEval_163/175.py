This function takes in two positive integers, `a` and `b`, and returns a list of even digits between `a` and `b`, inclusive, but in ascending order. The list will be empty if no even digits are found within the range. The assert statements ensure that the function handles edge cases where the inputs do not meet the requirements. 

Let's break down the code step by step:
1. **Function Definition**: `def generate_even_digits(a, b)`: This defines a function named `generate_even_digits` that takes two integer arguments `a` and `b`. The function is designed to return a list of even digits between `a` and `b`, inclusive, but in ascending order.
2. **Validation Check**: `assert a >= 2 and b >= 2 and a <= b`: This line ensures that the inputs `a` and `b` are valid. It checks that both are greater than or equal to 2 (ensuring they are positive integers) and that `a` is less than or equal to `b` (ensuring the range is valid). The `assert` statement raises an error if these conditions are not met, helping to catch invalid inputs during development and debugging.
3. **Empty Result Handling**: `if a > b: return []`: This code checks if the lower bound `a` is greater than the upper bound `b`. If this condition is true, it means there are no even digits to be found in the range, and the function returns an empty list `[]`.
4. **Even Digit Generation**: `even_digits = [int(d) for d in range(a, b + 1) if d % 2 == 0]`: This line generates a list of all integers `d` between `a` and `b` (inclusive), and then filters this list to include only the even digits. The `int(d)` conversion step ensures each element in the list is an integer, `range(a, b + 1)` generates all integers from `a` to `b` (inclusive), and `[d for d in range(a, b + 1) if d % 2 == 0]` filters this list to include only even integers.
5. **Return Result**: `return even_digits`: Finally, the function returns the list of even digits found in the specified range.

The test cases at the end demonstrate how the function works with different input scenarios and ensure that it meets the problem statement's requirements.
