This Python script defines a function `generate_even_digits(a, b)` designed to solve the given problem. It iterates through integers between `a` and `b`, extracts the second digit from the string representation, and appends the even digits to a list. The function ensures that `a` is the lower bound and handles cases where `a` is greater than `b`. Test cases are included to validate the function's behavior against expected outputs.
