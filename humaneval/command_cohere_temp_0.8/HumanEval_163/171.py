In the above code, the function `generate_even_digits` accepts two positive integers, `a` and `b`, and returns a list of even digits that are between `a` and `b`, inclusive, and sorted in ascending order. The function first checks if there are no eligible integers (where either `a` or `b` is odd or `a` is greater than `b`), and if so, it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it uses a list comprehension to iterate through the digits between `a` and `b` and filters the even numbers, which are then returned as a list. The tests aimed at the function cover all essential scenarios and edge cases to confirm it operates as expected.  This solution is efficient and well-tested, ensuring the correct functionality for a variety of inputs.  If needed, it could be further enhanced to be fully efficient with a linear time complexity instead of O(n^2) due to the usage of `range`. This can be done by using a 'while' loop instead of 'for' and cutting the range in half with each iteration.
