```python
def generate_even_digits(a, b):
    """
    Generates a list of even digits from the first to the last number given.

    Args:
        a (int): The first number in the range
        b (int): The last number in the range

    Returns:
        list: A list of even digits from the first to the last number in the input range, in ascending order.

    # Ensure a is the first number
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    
    even_digits = []
    for num in range(a, b + 1):
        if num % 2 == 0:
            even_digits.append(num)
    
    return even_digits

# Test Cases
print(generate_even_digits(2, 8))  # [2, 4, 6, 8]
print(generate_even_digits(8, 2))  # [2, 4, 6, 8]
print(generate_even_digits(10, 14))  # []
```

This script uses a simple loop to iterate through the digits of each number between a and b. It ensures that a is the first number and b is the last number in the range when the digits are presented in ascending order, and it populates the even digits into a list for return. The function includes logical testing to validate input, ensuring a is always the first number and b is always the last number in the range. Ultimately, it returns a list of even digits and leaves empty lists for cases where there are no even digits in the range.
