```

This code defines a function called `generate_even_digits(a, b)` that takes in two integers, `a` and `b`, and returns a list of even digits that fall between `a` and `b`, inclusive, always returning them in ascending order. Three test cases are defined to test the function; the first two test cases successfully find the even digits between the two numbers, while the third test case finds no even digits since there are no even digits between 10 and 14. 

To ensure the test is self-contained, it does not rely on external dependencies like internet access or predefined datasets. This makes it independent and guarantees it can run without any issues once the code is installed.
