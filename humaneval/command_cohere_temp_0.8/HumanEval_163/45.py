print(generate_even_digits(2, 8))  # [2, 4, 6, 8]

This function takes in two integers, `a` and `b`, and returns a list of even digits found in the range from `a` to `b`, inclusive, ensuring that both `a` and `b` are positive and even. The function checks for conditions that would make the problem impossible, namely that `a` and `b` are both even and that `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. The even digits are filtered from the range and returned in ascending order. 

The test cases shown in the code demonstrate the function's behavior for different scenarios. Feel free to adapt this code to your needs or build upon it further. Let me know if you would like to discuss any aspect of it further.
