This Python script defines a function called `generate_even_digits`, which takes two positive integers as arguments: `a` and `b`. The function's purpose is to create a list of even digits that are present in the range between `a` and `b`, and these even digits are then returned in ascending order. The function initially checks to see if `a` is greater than `b`, and if so, it reverses the order of `a` and `b` to ensure that `a` remains the lower bound. The function then goes through the range from `a` to `b` (inclusive) and determines whether each integer's remaining digit after removing all `0` digits is even; if it is, the integer is added to the `even_digits` list. Lastly, the function returns the list of even digits. 

The test cases provided in the script demonstrate how the function works with different ranges and the corresponding even digits that are generated. The function successfully handles the test cases, returning the expected even digits in each case.
