Here's a Python script that contains a function which fulfills the statement of the problem:
```python
def generate_even_digits(a, b):
    """
    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a and b, in ascending order.
    """
    # Ensure a is the smallest number by comparing with b first
    if b % 2 == 0: 
        a, b = b, a % 2 

    even_digits = [x for x in range(a, b + 1, 2)]
    return even_digits

# Test cases
print(generate_even_digits(2, 8))  # [2, 4, 6, 8]
print(generate_even_digits(8, 2))  # [2, 4, 6, 8]
print(generate_even_digits(10, 14)) # []
```

This script tests the function with the example inputs provided in the problem statement, and provides feedback in the console on the results. 

Let's break down the solution:
- The `generate_even_digits` function takes two positive integers a and b as input and returns the even digits between a and b, in ascending order.
- The input validation in the form of `if b % 2 == 0: a, b = b, a % 2` ensures that the lowest number is checked for evenness and also makes the loop in the next step more efficient by checking only odd numbers. 
- The `even_digits = [x for x in range(a, b + 1, 2)]` line creates a list of all even numbers from `a` to `b` (exclusive). The `range(a, b + 1, 2)` part creates a list of only the even numbers, and the result is a list of even digits in ascending order.  if `b % 2 == 0`, it swaps the values of a and b so that b is checked for evenness first. 

The `range(a, b + 1, 2)` is used to create a list of even numbers from 'a' to 'b', and the list comprehension `even_digits` is used to filter out the even numbers. Finally, the function returns the even_digits list.
