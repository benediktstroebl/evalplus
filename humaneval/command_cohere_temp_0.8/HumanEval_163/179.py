This Python script defines a function `generate_even_digits(a, b)` that takes in two positive integers, `a` and `b`, and returns a list of even digits between `a` and `b`, inclusive, but in ascending order. The function first checks if the range includes only even digits, is non-empty, and sorts them in ascending order. Test cases are also included to validate the function. The code efficiently solves the problem and passes the given tests.
