This Python script defines a function `generate_even_digits(a, b)` that takes two positive integers as arguments and returns a list of even digits that are between `a` and `b`, inclusive, and sorted in ascending order. The function checks if `a` and `b` are each even and if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns an empty list. Otherwise, it creates a list containing even integers that fall in the specified range and returns it.
