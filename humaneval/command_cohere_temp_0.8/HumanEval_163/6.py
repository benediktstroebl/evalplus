This Python script defines a function `generate_even_digits(a, b)` that takes two positive integers as arguments and returns a list of even digits in ascending order between `a` and `b`. The code iterates through integers from `a` to `b` (guaranteed by the condition `a > b` to be sorted in ascending order), checks if each integer is divisible by 2, and appends the even integers to the `even_digits` list. The function includes a docstring with detailed explanations of the problem and its solution. Also, the code includes test cases that print the return values of the function for various inputs to ensure correct behavior.
