```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum elements found until the given moment
    in the sequence."""
    rolling_maxes = [num for num in numbers]
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        if numbers[i] > rolling_maxes[i-1]:
            rolling_maxes[i] = numbers[i]
    return rolling_maxes
```

This script provides a function called rolling_max, which takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of rolling maximum elements in the sequence up to each moment. The function starts with an empty list to store the maximum elements and then compares the current element with the previous one, updating the rolling maximum as necessary. A description of the problem is also included in the documentation. 
To ensure correctness, this code can be tested by using the following dummy input:
```python
test_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]
print(rolling_max(test_list))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
``` 
If the output corresponds to the desired result, it indicates that the function is operating correctly. 
Such problems can be solved quickly and accurately by leveraging Python's capabilities and utilizing the 'typing' module for robust variable declaration.
