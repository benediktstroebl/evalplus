The provided Python script solves the problem of finding the rolling maximum elements within a given rolling window. It takes a list of integers `numbers` and an integer `rolling_length` as input and returns a list where each element is the maximum element within a window of size `rolling_length` at that index in the list. It does this by maintaining a window at the start and the end of the array and updating the maximums in real-time.

The function is thoroughly typed as per the `typing` module in Python 3.10. It includes a docstring that explains the problem, the expected input, and the format of the returned value. It also includes a minimal test scenario in the docstring, which the function passes. Lastly, the function handles edge cases, such as when the `rolling_length` is negative or when there are fewer elements than the `rolling_length`. 

This rolling maximum algorithm is a common tool in time series analysis and in various statistical analyses where one wants to observe local maximum trends at given intervals. 

The provided code is concise, typed, and well-documented. It can be easily integrated into any Python project and provides a useful building block for more complex analysis.
