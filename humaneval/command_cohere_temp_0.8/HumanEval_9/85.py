The provided Python script solves the problem of computing a list of rolling maximum elements from a given list of integers. The function takes an additional argument `rolling_window` that specifies the size of the rolling window. The function handles edge cases where the input list is empty or the rolling window is larger than the input length, and it returns an appropriate list of integers indicating the rolling maximum. 

The algorithm to accomplish this uses a `rolling_window` to keep track of the `rolling_max` values for the current window, initially filled with negative infinity values, and updates the values as the input iterates through, ensuring that the maximum seen until the current window is recorded. 

It then returns a list of length `len(numbers) - rolling_window + 1`, containing the computed rolling max values. The script includes a comment that describes the problem and its solution, and the function includes a docstring with additional documentation. 

This solution is a scalable, efficient Python implementation for computing the rolling maximum on a sliding window of a sequence of integers.
