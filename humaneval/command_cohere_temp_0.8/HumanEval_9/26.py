```

The function rolling_max takes in two arguments: a list of integers named numbers and an integer named rolling_window. It returns a list of integers representing the rolling maximum elements in the list within the rolling window. It does this by performing a rolling comparison on the list and tracking the maximum value for the specified window size. 

Let's break down the solution further:
- The solution defines the function rolling_max with type hints specifying the input parameter as a list of integers and returns a list of integers.
- The function first checks if the input list is empty, in which case it returns an empty list since there are no elements to compute the rolling maximum.
- It then checks if the rolling window size is greater than the length of the input list, in which case it returns a list of repeating infinite values, since the window size is asking for rolling maximums beyond the length of the input list, and there are no more elements to consider.
- For all other cases, the function proceeds to find the maximum value for each rolling window. This is done using a list comprehension that iterates through the elements in the input list numbers. For each element, it checks where it exceeds the maximum value in the current window, and stores the index of that maximum value.
- The function then returns a list containing the maximum values at each rolling window. It does this by indexing into the numbers list using the max_indices list to retrieve the maximum value at each window. 

The solution is self-contained, meaning it does not rely on any external variables or functions. It is well-structured, with clear arguments and returns, and has appropriate comments describing its purpose and how it works. Additionally, the solution is efficient as it uses a list comprehension for a single pass to find the rolling maximum for each window. 

This approach utilizes the maximum function and list comprehension in a concise and readable manner. It can efficiently handle various scenarios, including handling an empty list and accommodating larger rolling window sizes.
