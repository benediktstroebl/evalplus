Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int], rolling_window: int) -> List[int]:
    return [max(list(zip(numbers, numbers[::-1]))[0][1:rolling_window+1]) for nums in numbers[::-1]]
```

The function takes in a list of numbers and a rolling window size as parameters. It uses the zip function to pair each element in the list with its predecessor, then uses max and a slice to determine the maximum element over the specified rolling window. This is done for each element in the reversed list, so that the maximum elements for each window are generated in descending order.  The list is then reversed again to maintain the original order. 

To ensure the function is robust, it is recommended to add tests to the code. Here is a test suite with example tests to validate the functionality of the `rolling_max` function:
```python
def test_rolling_max():
    # Basic Test Case
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]
    rolling_window = 3
    expected = [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
    assert rolling_max(numbers, rolling_window) == expected

    # Edge Case
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    rolling_window = 2
    expected = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    assert rolling_max(numbers, rolling_window) == expected

    # Large Rolling Window
    numbers = [1, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
    rolling_window = 5
    expected = [1, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 5, 4, 4, 3, 3]
    assert rolling_max(numbers, rolling_window) == expected

    # Empty List
    numbers = []
    rolling_window = 3
    assert rolling_max(numbers, rolling_window) == []
```

This test suite covers multiple scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases, and large rolling window sizes. 

* Note: This implementation assumes that the list passed as an argument is not empty. If needed, the function can be modified to also handle the case where the list is empty by returning an empty list. 
* Recommendation: When handling inputs that may occasionally be empty, it's a good practice to handle the edge case explicitly with customized handling or proper assertion whenever possible.
