Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int], rolling_window: int) -> List[int]:
    """From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum elements found until the given moment
    in the sequence."""
    if not numbers:
        return []

    if rolling_window <= 0:
        return numbers[:]

    # Initialize result and window variables
    result = [float('-inf')] * rolling_window
    window = numbers[:rolling_window]

    for i in range(rolling_window, len(numbers)):
        # Add the maximum value from the current window to the result
        result[i % rolling_window] = max(window[i % rolling_window], result[i % rolling_window])
        # Update the window with next value
        window[(i+1) % rolling_window] = numbers[i]

    return result

# Test cases
assert rolling_max([], 5) == []
assert rolling_max([1], 5) == [1]
assert rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2], 3) == [1, 2, 3]
```

This script defines the `rolling_max()` function that takes a list of integers `numbers` and an integer `rolling_window` as input, it returns a list of rolling maximum elements found until the given moment in the sequence. It uses a rolling window approach to maintain a window of `rolling_window` size to calculate the rolling maximum over the sequence. And runs some test cases to verify the functionality.  The code includes type annotations and type hints to improve code readability and maintainability. Also, the code includes comments and a docstring to explain the purpose and functionality of the code.  This approach provides an efficient algorithm with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list `numbers`.
