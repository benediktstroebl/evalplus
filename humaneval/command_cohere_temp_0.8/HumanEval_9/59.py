```

This code defines a function called `rolling_max` that takes in a list of numbers and a window size. It returns a list of the maximum elements within the window. The function initially checks if the input list is empty, and if so, it returns an empty list. It also ensures that the window size is valid, being greater than 0 and less than or equal to the length of the input list. Invalid window sizes result in a ValueError.

The maximum elements within the window are calculated by initializing a list `max_list` with the first element of the input list and then iterating through the input list. On each iteration, the maximum of the current element and the maximum element from the `max_list` from `window_size` steps ago is appended to `max_list`.

The output of the example provided in the docstring is also printed out as expected:
```bash
[1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
``` 

This solution is efficient and robust, ensuring valid inputs and providing the expected results.
