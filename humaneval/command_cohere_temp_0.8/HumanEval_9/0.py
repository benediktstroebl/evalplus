```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int], rolling_window: int) -> List[int]:
    return [max(list(zip(numbers, numbers[-(rolling_window+1):]))[0]) for nums in numbers[::-1]]
```

The proposed function takes in a list of numbers and a rolling window parameter that indicates the size of the moving window. It utilizes a list comprehension and max function to generate a new list of integers containing the maximum value encountered within each rolling window in the sequence. The reverse loop is used to correctly index the list items. 

To ensure the function performs as expected, test cases can be integrated into the script. Here is an example of a test case:
```python
def test_rolling_max():
    # Test case one: basic rolling max
    input_ = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]
    rolling_max_result = [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
    assert rolling_max(input_, 2) == rolling_max_result  

test_rolling_max()
```

In the test case, the `rolling_max` function is applied to the input list, and the result is compared to the expected output. Running this test verifies the accuracy of the function. 

Note: This solution assumes that the rolling window size is valid and smaller than the input list's length. If the size of the rolling window is larger than the input list, an error should be handled. 
If the size of the rolling window is variable and needs to be inferred from the input, the function signature could be updated to handle this use case, as depicted below:
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    rolling_window = len(numbers) - 1
    return [max(list(zip(numbers, numbers[-(rolling_window+1):]))[0]) for nums in numbers[::-1]]
```
This solution assumes that the input list is non-empty and that the rolling window size is the size of the list less one, which is a valid assumption for this problem.
