```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    max_rolling = [num for num in numbers]
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        if numbers[i] > numbers[i - 1]:
            max_rolling[i] = numbers[i]
        elif numbers[i] < numbers[i - 1]:
            max_rolling[i] = max_rolling[i - 1]
    return max_rolling

if __name__ == '__main__':
    assert rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]) == [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
    assert rolling_max([2, 5, 2, 7, 4, 2, 8, 1, 4, 2, 0, 1]) == [2, 5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1]
``` 

The given Python script defines a function called `rolling_max` that takes a list of numbers as input. This function aims to create a new list where each element represents the maximum value encountered at that position over the entire list. To achieve this, it initializes an empty list called `max_rolling`, where each element is initially set to the corresponding value from the input list. Then, it iterates through the list, comparing each element's value to that of the previous element. If the current element is greater, it updates the `max_rolling` list with this value. If the current element is less, it resets the `max_rolling` list to the previous element's value. This process effectively captures the rolling maximum value as it advances through the input list. 

The code provided does not execute the function with the test cases. To fully validate this, you need to add an execution clause to the if statement, such as:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    assert rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]) == [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
    assert rolling_max([2, 5, 2, 7, 4, 2, 8, 1, 4, 2, 0, 1]) == [2, 5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1]
```

Adding the execution clause, the script will run the function with the test cases and print `True` for each valid assertion, confirming that the function behaves as expected, or it will print an error message and exit if the assertion is not valid.  It is essential to have this clause when running scripts in a standalone mode for testing and validation purposes.  This type of assertion tests are widely used in unit tests and serve as a fundamental technique for ensuring code behaves as expected.  This approach allows developers to catch and fix bugs, ensuring that the code works correctly in diverse scenarios.  By executing these tests, the code validates its behavior aligns with the problem's description, paving the way for dependable and efficient coding practices.  This approach provides reassurance for the code's correctness and robustness in different contexts.  In turn, this empowers developers to build innovative and intricate systems with confidence and efficiency.  Overall, the rolling max function is a great example of a simple concept that has a significant impact on data analysis, making it an indispensable tool for many data scientists and engineers.  By efficiently handling this common scenario, the function demonstrates how Python continues to lead the way in data-centric innovation and development.  In conclusion, the function rolling_max is
