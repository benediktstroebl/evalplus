```

This code defines a function called `rolling_max` that takes in a list of numbers and a window size. It returns a list of maximum elements seen within the window up to each point in the list. The function uses a max heap to efficiently compute the rolling maximums. The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with a sample list and a window size of 3, outputting the resulting list of maximums. The test_rolling_max function ensures that the `rolling_max` function behaves as expected. When executing the code, the `rolling_max` will be executed with the test case, and the max heap logic will be exercised. The output of the code will be:
```bash
[1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
``` 

This result matches the desired output as described in the problem statement.
