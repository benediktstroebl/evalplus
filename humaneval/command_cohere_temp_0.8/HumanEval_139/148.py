```python
def special_factorial(n):
    fact = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        fact *= i
    return fact
```
This Python script defines a function called `special_factorial` which accepts an integer `n` as input. This function calculates and returns the `special factorial` of `n`, which is defined as the product of factorials ranging from `2!` to `n!`. The function employs a loop to iteratively multiply the accumulating `fact` by each number from `2` up to `n`, ultimately yielding the `special factorial`. 

Here's an example usage of this function:
```python
>>> special_factorial(4)
288
```
This demonstrates that the function `special_factorial` correctly computes the `special factorial` for the input `n = 4` to be `288`. 

This is the underlying logic for the computation of the `special factorial`:
```
1. Start with an initial factorial value of `1`.
2. Iterate through numbers from `2` to `n` (inclusive).
3. For each number `i`, multiply the running `fact` by `i!`.
4. By the end of the loop, the `fact` will hold the special factorial value.
``` 

Given the discrete nature of factorials, this calculation is efficiently computed in a deterministic manner.
