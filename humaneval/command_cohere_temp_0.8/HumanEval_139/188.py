```python
def special_factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```
This Python script defines a function called `special_factorial` which accepts an integer `n` as input. This function calculates the `brazilian_factorial` of `n` by iterating through all numbers from 1 to `n` and multiplying them together. This operation is repeated for each number from 1 to `n`, effectively computing the product of all positive integers up to `n`. This accumulation of products yields the Brazilian factorial value, which is then returned by the function. 

For example, if you call `special_factorial(4)`, the function will return `288`, which is the Brazilian factorial of 4 (`4! * 3! * 2! * 1! = 288`). 

This approach is efficient and directly computes the desired result using a loop, avoiding any recursive calls. The code is self-contained and does not rely on any external variables or functions, making it reusable and easy to maintain.
