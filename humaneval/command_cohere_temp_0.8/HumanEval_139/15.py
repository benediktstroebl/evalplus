The `special_factorial` function calculates the Brazilian factorial of `n` by first calculating the ordinary factorial of `n` using a recursive implementation of the `factorial` function, and then iterating from 2 to `n` and dividing the result by the factorial of each integer. The test suite is minimal, and the code defines the `test_brazilian_factorial` function, which calls `assert` to check if the output of `special_factorial` is correct for a range of inputs from 0 to 6.  If you want to test this function with large inputs, you may need to adapt the testing strategy, as the current implementation is not optimized for efficiency.  This approach results in a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the multiplicative and recursive aspects of the process. Nevertheless, it provides the correct result for the given inputs.  If you need a more efficient solution, you may need to use a iterative calculation of factorials.  Feel free to modify the tests or the function to fulfill the requirements.
