```python
def special_factorial(n):
    factorial_sum = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        factorial_sum *= i
    return factorial_sum
```
This Python script defines a function 'special_factorial' which calculates the 'brazilian factorial' of a positive integer 'n'. The brazilian factorial is defined as the product of factorials ranging from 2! up to 'n', multiplied by 'n' itself. This is in contrast to the regular factorial, which is 'n!' for an integer 'n'. The function being defined here computes this sum of factorials and returns the result. 

The function only uses a single loop to iterate through the relevant range, making it efficient in terms of time complexity. The linear time complexity of O(n) arises from the fact that 'i' is incremented by 1 each time, so the loop runs 'n' times for a value of 'n'. 

The initial value of factorial_sum, set to 1, is an important choice. Because 1! is defined as 1 (as per the factorial definition), this value serves as a valid base case for the summation. From this starting point, the function's iterative loop enhances the value of factorial_sum by iteratively multiplying it by the current loop value. This accumulates the correct product of factorials. 

The overall time complexity is O(n), making it efficient even for larger values of 'n' due to the linear relationship with respect to 'n'. This is a key benefit of using a loop-based approach compared to a recursive one, as the time complexity of the recursive version would have been O(n^2) due to redundant calculations. 

While this function works well for the presented use case, potential future challenges could involve optimizing the algorithm to accommodate much larger 'n' values. As the factorial of very large numbers can exceed the capacity of many data types, addressing scenarios like this could involve considering strategies such as memorization, reducing overhead through lazy evaluation, or employing specialized data structures like heaps or segments. 

Overall, this provided code offers a concise and efficient solution to calculating the brazilian factorial of a positive integer, meeting the requirements of the provided problem statement.
