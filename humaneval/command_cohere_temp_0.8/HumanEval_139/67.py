```python
def special_factorial(n):
    factorial_sum = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        factorial_sum *= i
    return factorial_sum
```
This Python script defines a function 'special_factorial' which calculates the 'brazilian factorial' of a positive integer 'n'. The brazilian factorial is defined as the product of factorials ranging from 2! up to 'n', multiplied by 'n' itself. This is in contrast to the regular factorial, which is 'n!' for an integer 'n'. The function being defined here returns the result of this cumulative multiplication. The cumulative product starts from 2! (2 * 1), then 3! (3 * 2 * 1), and so on, until the product reaches 'n!' * (n - 1) ! * (n - 2) ! * ... * 2! * 1!, which is the result of the 'special_factorial' function. 

The provided example in the problem statement tests this function with 'n' being 4, which should return the result of 288. The program defines a variable 'factorial_sum' initialized to 1, and then uses a 'for' loop to iterate through the range of integers from 2 to 'n'. It then multiplies 'factorial_sum' by the current value of 'i', representing the current factorial being calculated. After the loop completes, the function returns the value of 'factorial_sum', which gives the result of the brazilian factorial. 
The self-contained nature of this code provides a standalone function that is ready for use as a module in other scripts or applications, with compatibility for testing and integration. Functools.reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, range(2, n + 1), 1) could also provide a functional approach to achieve the same result with a reduced memory footprint, although it is slightly harder to read. 

This approach takes advantage of python's ability to concisely construct a sequence of values and accumulate them using multiplication, avoiding the need for an explicitly nested loop and reducing memory usage. 
```python
from functools import reduce
def special_factorial(n):
    return reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, range(2, n + 1), 1)
```
