```python
def special_factorial(n):
    factorial_list = [1]
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        factorial_list.append(i * factorial_list[i-1])
    return factorial_list[n]
```

This Python script defines the `special_factorial` function, which calculates the Brazilian factorial of a given integer `n`. The Brazilian factorial is represented as a list of factorials from `1!` through `n!`, and the provided code computes this list incrementally, ensuring efficient computation.

For testing, you can use the following input to verify the correctness of the implemented function:
```python
test_cases = [
    (1, 1),
    (2, 2),
    (3, 6),
    (4, 288),
    (10, 25,000,000,000),
    (20, 24,228,672,581,600,000,000,000)
]

for n, result in test_cases:
    assert special_factorial(n) == result
```

This test suite covers a range of input values, ensuring the function handles different cases correctly. Each test case consists of an input `n` and the expected `result`. By asserting the output of `special_factorial(n)` against `result` for each test case, you can validate that the function produces the expected Brazilian factorial values for various inputs.
