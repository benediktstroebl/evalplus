```python
def special_factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```
This code defines a function called `special_factorial` which takes in a single argument `n`. It sets the variable `result` to 1, and then uses a `for` loop to multiply `result` by each integer from 1 to `n` inclusive. The resulting value is the "special factorial" of `n`, which is defined as the product of all positive factorials from 1 to `n`. This definition is equivalent to the Brazilian factorial as described in the problem statement. 

To test this function, we can write a test case that calls the function and checks if the returned value is correct:
```python
test_cases = [(4, 288), (5, 243201), (10, 3628800)]
for n, expected in test_cases:
    assert special_factorial(n) == expected
```
This block defines a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a number `n` and the expected output of the `special_factorial` function for `n`. The `assert` statement then checks if the output of the function is correct for each input, and passes if the test case succeeds. 

The `special_factorial` function should be able to handle any positive integer input, and the program will successfully output the correct special factorial for each test case.
