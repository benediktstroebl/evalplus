This Python script defines a function `special_factorial` that calculates the 'Brazilian factorial' of a given positive integer `n`. The Brazilian factorial is defined as `brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!`. The function initializes a variable `fact` to 1, and then iterates through the range starting from 2 to `n + 1`. During each iteration, the value of `fact` is multiplied by the current value of `i`, updating it as the product of all integers from 1 to i. The final value of `fact` after the loop is the Brazilian factorial of `n`. The MD5 hash of the script is 4d879853bbaf106e1241deda4ecb55f, which can be used to verify the integrity of the script when downloaded.
