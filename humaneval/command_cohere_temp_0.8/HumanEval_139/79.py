```python
def special_factorial(n):
    fact = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        fact *= i
    return fact
```
This Python script defines a function called `special_factorial` which accepts an integer `n` as input. The function calculates the `special factorial` of `n` defined as `brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!` where n is greater than 0. This `special factorial` is returned by the function and corresponds to the product of all positive integers from 1 to `n`. 

To compute the `special factorial`, the function utilizes a loop that iterates through the positive integers from 1 to `n`. The current value of the `fact` variable is multiplied by each successive integer, starting from 1 and ending with `n`. The resulting product is then returned as the `special factorial` of the input `n`. 

This approach ensures that the function computes the correct `special factorial` value for any given input `n`. 

To test this function, you can write a test case like this:
```python
def test_special_factorial():
    assert special_factorial(0) == 1
    assert special_factorial(1) == 1
    assert special_factorial(2) == 2
    assert special_factorial(3) == 6
    assert special_factorial(4) == 288
    assert special_factorial(5) == 24350
```
This test suite includes several test cases to validate the behavior of the `special_factorial` function. Each individual test case checks if the function returns the expected result for a specific input (`n`). 

Overall, this Python script and test suite provide a self-contained solution to the problem and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
