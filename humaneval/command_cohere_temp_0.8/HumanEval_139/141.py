```python
def special_factorial(n):
    factorial_list = [1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        factorial_list.append(i * factorial_list[i - 1])
    return factorial_list[n]
```
This function calculates the 'special factorial' for a given integer `n`. The 'special factorial', as defined in the prompt, is a product of factorials from 1 to `n`. The function iterates through the numbers from 2 to `n` and accumulates the factorials in the `factorial_list` array. Finally, it returns the last element of this array, which represents the 'special factorial' of `n`.

Here is a simple test suite for this function:
```python
def test_special_factorial():
    assert special_factorial(0) == 1, "0! = 1"
    assert special_factorial(1) == 1, "1! = 1"
    assert special_factorial(2) == 2, "2! = 2"
    assert special_factorial(3) == 6, "3! = 6"
    assert special_factorial(4) == 288, "4! = 288"
    assert special_factorial(5) == 15120, "5! = 15120"
```
This test suite covers the basic cases of the `special_factorial` function. Specifically, it tests if the function correctly calculates the factorial for integers from 0 to 5.

When running the test suite, the output will indicate whether the assertions pass successfully, or if there are any failures or errors.

For example, if you use the `pytest` testing framework:
```bash
pytest -vv test_special_factorial.py
```
Output when all tests pass:
```bash
===================== test session starts ======================
collected=6 items

test_special_factorial.py ..

===================== 6 passed and 0 failed in 0.02 seconds ===============
``` 
This indicates that all the tests have successfully passed. 

Should you wish to implement additional tests, the testing framework `pytest` provides a wide range of features and assert functions that can be utilized for more comprehensive test coverage. You can refer to the `pytest` documentation for further guidance on crafting robust test cases.
