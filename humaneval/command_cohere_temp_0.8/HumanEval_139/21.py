```python
def special_factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result //= factorial(i)
    return result

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Tests
def test_special_factorial():
    assert special_factorial(0) == 1
    assert special_factorial(1) == 1
    assert special_factorial(2) == 2
    assert special_factorial(3) == 6
    assert special_factorial(4) == 288

test_special_factorial()
```

The `special_factorial` function calculates the Brazilian factorial recursively, and the `factorial` function calculates the factorial of a number. The `test_special_factorial` function is an example test that can be used to verify the correctness of the `special_factorial` function. Simply run the script to see the test results.  This approach provides a clear and efficient way to accomplish the task while keeping everything self-contained within the function.
