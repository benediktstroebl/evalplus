```python
def special_factorial(n):
    fact = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        fact *= i
    return fact
```
This Python script defines a function called `special_factorial` which accepts an integer `n` as input. The function operates by incrementing a variable `fact` from `1` through integers from `2` up to `n + 1`, multiplying `fact` by each of these integers in turn. The result is the value of `fact` at the end of the loop, which is the product of all the integers from 2 to `n` calculated as the product of the factorials of `n` and `n-1` and so on down to 1, as specified by the Brazilian factorial definition. 

This approach provides a straightforward way to compute the Brazilian factorial for a given value of `n`. 

To verify the accuracy of this function, you can use the following test case in the Python environment of your choice:
```python
>>> special_factorial(4)
288
```
This will confirm that the function behaves as expected, producing the correct result for input `4`.
