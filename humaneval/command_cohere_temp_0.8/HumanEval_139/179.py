```python
def special_factorial(n):
    fact = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        fact *= i
    return fact
```
This code defines a function called `special_factorial` which takes in a single argument `n`. It sets the variable `fact` to 1 and then uses a `for` loop to multiply `fact` by each integer from 1 to `n` inclusive. It then returns the resulting `fact` which represents the "Brazilian factorial" as defined in the problem statement. 

To incorporate tests to validate the function, one can create an additional script file or utilize an established testing framework like pytest. Here is an example of the former:
```python
def test_special_factorial():
    assert special_factorial(0) == 1
    assert special_factorial(1) == 1
    assert special_factorial(2) == 2
    assert special_factorial(3) == 6
    assert special_factorial(4) == 288
    assert special_factorial(5) == 15120
```
In this example, the function `test_special_factorial` asserts the return value of `special_factorial` for different values of `n` to check whether it returns the expected result.
