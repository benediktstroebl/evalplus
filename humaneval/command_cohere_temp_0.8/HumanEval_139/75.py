```python
def special_factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```
This code defines a function called `special_factorial` which takes in a single argument `n`. It uses a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to `n`, and for each number `i`, it multiplies the current value of `result` by `i`, accumulating the product of all these numbers as it goes. This calculation is equivalent to the definition of the "Brazilian factorial" as described in the problem statement. Finally, it returns the computed `result` as the output of the function. 

To ensure clarity and readability of the code, it's a good practice to add documentation to the function that explains its purpose, parameters, and output. This would make it easier for others and future self to understand the functionality of the function. 

This code is self-contained and does not rely on any external modules or libraries, which makes it easy to use and distribute. Additionally, the lack of dependencies also contributes to the simplicity and efficiency of the code.
