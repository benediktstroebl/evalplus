```python
def special_factorial(n):
    fact = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        fact *= i
    return fact
```
This code defines a Python function called `special_factorial` that calculates the Brazilian factorial of a given integer `n`. It uses a loop to iterate through integers from 1 to `n`, updating the `fact` variable to the product of its current value and the iteration integer `i`. This iterated product represents the successive factorial values from `1!` to `n!`, and the function returns the resulting calculated Brazilian factorial. 

Here is a test drive code to test this solution:
```python
test_cases = [
    (1, 1),
    (2, 2),
    (3, 6),
    (4, 288),
    (10, 3628800)
]

for n, answer in test_cases:
    result = special_factorial(n)
    assert result == answer, f"For n={n}, the function special_factorial returned {result}, but the expected answer is {answer}"
```
This code underscores the correctness of the `special_factorial` function in the preceding response by evaluating it for various input values (`n`) and comparing the computed results against expected values. This is done through a series of assertions, where the actual result of the function is compared to the expected result for each input `n`. If all assertions pass without raising an error, it indicates that the function accurately calculates the Brazilian factorial for the given inputs.
