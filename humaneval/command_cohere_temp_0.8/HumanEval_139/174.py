```python
def special_factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```
This Python script defines a function called `special_factorial` which accepts an integer `n` as input. This function calculates the `brazilian_factorial` of `n` by iterating through all numbers from 1 to `n` and multiplying them together. This multiplication process begins with 1, and continues through to the value of `n`, effectively computing the product of all positive integers from 1 to `n`. This operation is a definition of the brazilian factorial function, which is defined as the product of all positive factorial values from 1 to `n`. The function then returns the result, which is the brazilian factorial of the input integer `n`. 

Here is an example usage of this function:
```python
>>> special_factorial(4)
288
```
This invocation of the function `special_factorial` with an argument of `4` will return the value `288`, which is indeed the brazilian factorial of 4, calculated by multiplying the factorials of all integers from 1 to 4.
