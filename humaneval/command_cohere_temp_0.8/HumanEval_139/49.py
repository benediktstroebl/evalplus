Here's a Python script that defines the `brazilian_factorial` function as per the provided problem description:
```python
def special_factorial(n):
    fact = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        fact *= i
    return fact
```

This function definition is self-contained and should solve the given problem, where it returns the 'special factorial' for a given integer `n`.
