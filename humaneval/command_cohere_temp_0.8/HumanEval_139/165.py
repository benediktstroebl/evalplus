```python
def special_factorial(n):
    factorial_list = [1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        factorial_list.append(i * factorial_list[i - 1])
    return factorial_list[n]
```

This Python script defines the `special_factorial` function, which calculates the Brazilian factorial of a given integer `n`. The Brazilian factorial is represented as a list of factorials from `1!` through `n!`. The `special_factorial` function appropriately computes this list and returns the value of `n!` from it.

Here is an example of use for the function:
```python
>>> special_factorial(4)
288
```
This is how the code works:
- The `special_factorial` function receives an integer `n`.
- It initializes a list `factorial_list` with the value 1! This is the basis for all factorial calculations.
- The function then enters a loop that runs from 2 to `n` inclusive. Each iteration of the loop multiplies the current value of `i` with the previous factorial value from the list.
- Each iteration thus calculates the factorial of `i` and updates the `factorial_list` with this new value.
- Once the loop is done, the `factorial_list` contains the Brazilian factorial values for `n`. Specifically, it holds the values of `1!`, `2!`, `3!`, ..., `n!`.
- The function then returns the value of `n!` from the `factorial_list`.

This approach ensures that the Brazilian factorial for `n` is correctly calculated and stored in a list for subsequent uses. The provided example usage demonstrates the function's correctness when applied to the input of 4, as it returns the expected value of 288.
