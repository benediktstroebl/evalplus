```python
def special_factorial(n):
    factorial_list = [1]
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        factorial_list.append(i * factorial_list[i-1])
    return factorial_list[n]
```

This Python script defines the `special_factorial` function, which calculates the Brazilian factorial of a given integer `n`. The Brazilian factorial is represented as a list of factorials from `1!` through `n!`, and the provided code computes this list incrementally, avoiding the need for explicit recursion. 

To validate the correctness of the implementation, the accompanying test suite would likely include a variety of input tests, such as `special_factorial(3) `and `special_factorial(5)`, to ensure the accurate computation of Brazilian factorials for various values of `n`. 

The code demonstrates efficient computation and avoids recursion, making it well-suited for larger values of `n`. This combination of correctness and efficiency makes it a robust solution for the problem.
