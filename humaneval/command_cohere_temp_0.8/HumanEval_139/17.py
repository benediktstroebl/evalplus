```python
def special_factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```
This script defines a function `special_factorial(n)` that calculates the `brazilian_factorial` of a positive integer `n`. The `brazilian_factorial` is defined as the product of all positive factorial values from 1 to `n`. The function iterates from 1 to `n` and accumulates the product of all values into the `result` variable, effectively calculating the desired value. The given example usage and test case are correct, but they don't illustrate the functional essence of the `brazilian_factorial` definition; they merely repeat the definition itself. The script's main purpose is to compute the `brazilian_factorial` of a provided integer `n`.
