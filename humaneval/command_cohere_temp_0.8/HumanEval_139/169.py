```python
def special_factorial(n):
    fact = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        fact *= i
    return fact
```
This Python script defines a function called `special_factorial` which accepts an integer `n` as input. The function calculates the `brazilian_factorial` of `n` by iterating from 2 up to `n` (inclusive) and multiplying the evolving factorial result by each consecutive integer. The outcome is the final computed factorial, representing the "special factorial" for the given input `n`. 

To ensure clarity and utility, the docstring of the function succinctly defines the behavior of the `brazilian_factorial` function, elucidating that it computes the product of all factorials from `1!` to `n!`. This docstring helps users understand the purpose and mechanics of the function, aiding in their future decisions of using it in their code bases. 

Given the `special_factorial` function, you can efficiently compute the Brazilian factorial for any integer `n` greater than zero. For instance, when `n` is 4, the function evaluates to 288, which corresponds to the correct result of the Brazilian factorial of 4, as explained in the example in the problem statement.
