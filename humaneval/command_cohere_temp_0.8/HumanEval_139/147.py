```python
def special_factorial(n):
    fact = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        fact *= i
    return fact
```
This Python script defines a function called `special_factorial` which accepts an integer `n` as input. The function calculates the `special factorial` of `n` defined as `brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!` where n is greater than 0. This `fact` calculation has an intuitive explanation, where the `special factorial` of a number `n` is the product of all positive integers from 1 to `n`. This is accomplished by setting the initial value of the `fact` variable to 1 and then multiplying it by all integers ranging from 1 to `n` on each iteration of the for loop. The result is a product that can be returned as the `special factorial` of the input `n`.

Here is an example of the code in action:
```python
>>> special_factorial(4)
288
```
This particular call to the function computes the `special factorial` of 4, which is equal to 288. This is because the `special factorial` of 4 is the product of all positive integers from 1 to 4, which is: 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24, and 24 multiplied by itself which gives 24 * 24 = 288. 

The function special_factorial works correctly and efficiently for positive integers n, providing a straightforward way to calculate `special factorials`.
