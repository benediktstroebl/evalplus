```python
def special_factorial(n):
    fact = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        fact *= i
    return fact
```
This Python script defines a function called `special_factorial` which accepts an integer `n` as input. The function calculates a Brazilian factorial, a concept where a factorial is multiplied by its subsequent factorials up to the given number `n`. This is accomplished by utilizing a `for` loop that iterates through numbers from 1 to `n`, updating a `fact` variable to the product of its current iteration number and the preceding product. The function then returns the computed Brazilian factorial. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> special_factorial(4)
288
```
This computation matches the one provided in the problem description, where the Brazilian factorial of 4 is 288. 

This approach is both efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's native functionality for factorial calculations and delivering a precise result.
