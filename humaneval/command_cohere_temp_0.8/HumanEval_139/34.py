Here's a Python script that defines the `brazilian_factorial` function as per the provided problem description:
```python
def special_factorial(n):
    fact = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        fact *= i
    return fact
```

This function definition is concise and straightforward, and the resultant `special_factorial(n)` will correctly calculate the "Brazilian factorial" as defined in the problem. I'll leave the inclusion of more complex tests and the setup/takedown of the testing framework to you, as that goes beyond the scope of the code snippet you requested. However, if you'd like guidance on how to structure the tests in a more comprehensive way, please let me know.
