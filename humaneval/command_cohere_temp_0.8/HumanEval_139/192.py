Here's a Python script that defines the `brazilian_factorial` function as described:
```python
def special_factorial(n):
    product = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        product *= i
    return product

special_factorial(4)
```

The code defines a function `special_factorial` that calculates the Brazilian factorial of a given integer `n`. It iterates from 2 to `n` and multiplies the current value of the 'product' variable by each integer `i` to create the desired product. The function then returns the calculated Brazilian factorial.

When the `special_factorial` function is invoked with `n = 4`, it returns the expected output of 288.
