```python
def special_factorial(n):
    factorial_list = [1]
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        factorial_list.append(i * factorial_list[i-1])
    return factorial_list[n]
```

This Python script defines the `special_factorial` function, which calculates the Brazilian factorial of a given integer `n`. The Brazilian factorial is represented as a list of factorials from `1!` through `n!`. The core computation iteratively computes this list using a loop that starts from `2` (since `1` is already in the list) and accumulates the factorials up to `n`. The result is the final value of `factorial_list[n]`. 

The code efficiently computes the factorials and is capable of handling larger values of `n`. It offers an intuitive and straightforward solution to the problem, avoiding any complex mathematical deductions, and instead opting for a more procedural approach. 

Note that the provided code appears to be a simplified basic version of a more robust solution. Normally, code of this complexity would benefit from comments and possibly docstrings to explain the different parts of the code, as well as more extensive testing, such as edge case analysis and performance optimization.
