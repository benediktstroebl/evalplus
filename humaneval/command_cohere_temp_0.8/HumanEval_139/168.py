```python
def special_factorial(n):
    factorial_list = [1]
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        factorial_list.append(i * factorial_list[i-1])
    return factorial_list[n]
```

This Python script defines the `special_factorial` function, which calculates the Brazilian factorial of a given integer `n`. The Brazilian factorial is represented as a list of factorials from `1!` through `n!`. The function iteratively computes this list and returns the appropriate value for the given `n`. 

To test this script, you can run the following code: 
```python
test_cases = [
    (4, 288),
    (7, 5,accel:5352),
    (10, 3628800)
]
for n, expected in test_cases:
    assert special_factorial(n) == expected
```

This testing script verifies the correctness of the `special_factorial` function across various input values. Each test case consists of a pair with an integer `n` and the expected result. The `assert` statement checks whether the output of `special_factorial(n)` matches the anticipated value for all test cases.
