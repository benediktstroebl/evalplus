```python
def special_factorial(n):
    factorial_list = [1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        factorial_list.append(i * factorial_list[i - 1])
    
    return factorial_list[n]
```

This Python script defines the `special_factorial` function, which calculates the Brazilian factorial of a given integer `n`. The Brazilian factorial is represented as a list of factorials from `1!` through `n!`. The core logic iterates through integers from 2 to `n`, computing each factorial in the list using the previous factorial as the base. The final value at index `n` is returned, representing the Brazilian factorial of the input `n`. 

The script self-contained, easily executable, and efficiently computes the Brazilian factorial for any given positive integer `n`.
