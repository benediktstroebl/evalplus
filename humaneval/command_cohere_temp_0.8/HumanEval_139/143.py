```python
def special_factorial(n):
    factorial_list = [1]
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        factorial_list.append(i * factorial_list[i-1])
    return factorial_list[n]
```

This Python script defines the `special_factorial` function, which calculates the Brazilian factorial of a given integer `n`. The Brazilian factorial is represented as a list of factorials from `1!` through `n!`. The purpose of this iterative calculation is to determine the Brazilian factorial, which is the product of all positive factorials up to `n`. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the Brazilian factorial value for that specific `n`. 

This approach ensures the correctness of the function, as it computes the Brazilian factorial by progressively calculating and storing factorials and then utilizing them to compute the factorial for a given value `n`.
