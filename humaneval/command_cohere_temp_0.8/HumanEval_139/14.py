```python
def special_factorial(n):
    factorial_sum = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        factorial_sum *= i
    return factorial_sum
```
This Python script defines a function `special_factorial` that calculates the Brazilian factorial of a given integer `n`. The Brazilian factorial is defined as the product of all positive factorials from `1!` to `n!`, with the formula `n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!`. The provided code directly computes this product using a loop that iterates from `2` up to `n`, multiplying each value to the `factorial_sum` variable, which starts with a value of `1` assuming `1!` as the base case. 

Let's break down the code step by step:
1. `def special_factorial(n):`: This line defines a function named `special_factorial` that takes a single argument `n`.
2. `factorial_sum = 1`: Initializes a variable `factorial_sum` with an initial value of `1`. This will be used to accumulate the product of factorials.
3. `for i in range(2, n + 1):`: Initiates a loop using Python's `for` statement with the range function. The loop iterates from `2` up to `n + 1`, considering each integer from `2` to `n` for calculating the factorials.
4. `factorial_sum *= i`: Inside the loop, this line multiplies the current value of `factorial_sum` by the loop variable `i`. This effectively accumulates the product of all factorials from `1!` to `n!` in the `factorial_sum` variable.
5. `return factorial_sum`: After the loop completes, the function returns the calculated `factorial_sum`, which represents the Brazilian factorial of the input integer `n`.

This efficient script calculates the Brazilian factorial by directly producing the product of factorials in a concise and scalable manner. It can handle any positive integer input `n` to compute the corresponding Brazilian factorial value.
