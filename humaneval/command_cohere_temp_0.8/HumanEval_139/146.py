```python
def special_factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result //= i
    return result
```
This code defines a Python function called `special_factorial` that calculates the Brazilian factorial of a given positive integer `n`. The Brazilian factorial is a generalized concept of factorial where the product of all positive integers from `1` to `n` is multiplied by the product of all positive integers from `2` to `n-1`, and so on. 

The function first arrives at the result by multiplying all integers from `1` to `n`, and then performs the necessary divisions to achieve the Brazilian factorial definition.
