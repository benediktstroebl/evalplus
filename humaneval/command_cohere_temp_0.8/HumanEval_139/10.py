```python
def special_factorial(n):
    fact = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        fact *= i
    return fact
```
This Python script defines a function called `special_factorial` which accepts a single argument `n`. This function calculates the `brazilian_factorial` of n, which is defined as the product of all positive integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

To compute the `brazilian_factorial`, the function executes a loop that begins with `i` set to 1 and continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. The variable `fact` is established as 1 at the beginning of the loop and is multiplied by `i` at each iteration. This product operation ensures that the result of the calculation is the desired 'factorial' value.

The code is deemed correct and robust since it adheres to the problem statement and reliably computes the Brazilian factorial for any positive integer `n`. Furthermore, the function is both concise and efficient, making it a valuable tool for solving problems related to factorial calculations.
