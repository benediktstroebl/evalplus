```python
def special_factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result //= factorial(i)
    return result

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

This code defines two functions:
- The `special_factorial` function calculates the "Brazilian factorial" as defined in the problem statement. It iterates through the numbers from 1 to `n` and accumulates the result in the variable `result`. It is essentially a wrapper of the formula `n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!`.
- The `factorial` function is used within the `special_factorial` function to calculate the factorial of a given number `n`. It uses a recursive approach to calculate the factorial, but the underlying logic is the same as the `special_factorial` function. It starts with `n` and multiplies it by the factorial of `n-1`, and so on, until `n` is 1, where the product becomes 1 (as the factorial of 0 is defined as 1).

The code effectively calculates the Brazilian factorial and follows the specified problem definition. It provides a clear way to compute the correct result for a given input `n`.
