```python
def special_factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result //= factorial(i)
    return result

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Tests
assert special_factorial(4) == 288
```

This code defines two functions:
- The `special_factorial` function calculates the "Brazilian factorial" as defined in the problem statement. It iterates through `factorial(i)` for all `i` from 2 to `n` and multiplies them to the `result` variable, then iterates through all `i` from 3 to `n` and divides the `result` by `factorial(i)` in the end, it returns the `result` as the special factorial. 
- The `factorial` function is a helper function that calculates the standard factorial of a non-negative integer `n`. It uses recursion, meaning that if `n` is 0, it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns `n` multiplied by the factorial of `n-1`. 

The code also includes a test that checks if the `special_factorial` function returns the expected output for the example input. You can run this test by yourself using Python:
```bash
python -m pytest -sv
```

Make sure to have the `pytest` library installed. If not, you can do it with `pip install pytest`. 

**Note:** This code assumes that the `factorial` function is defined and behaves as expected for non-negative integers `n`.  If needed, we can implement it as part of this code providing a more complete solution.
