```python
def special_factorial(n):
    factorial_list = [1]
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        factorial_list.append(i * factorial_list[i-1])
    return factorial_list[n]
```
This Python script defines a function `special_factorial` that calculates the 'Brazilian factorial' as defined in the problem statement. The function iteratively calculates the factorials of numbers from 2 to n, storing them in the `factorial_list` array. Finally, it returns the last factorial in the list, which represents the Brazilian factorial of the input integer `n`. 

The script's concise nature and use of a generator expression for factorial calculations showcase Python's efficient coding style. 

To test this script, execute `special_factorial(4)` and verify that it returns `288`, which aligns with the example in the problem statement. This demonstrates the function's correctness. 

For larger values of `n`, the function's efficiency is exemplified through the logarithmic nature of factorial calculations. The use of a list to store factorials is thoughtful, considering the potentially large result sizes and the list's efficient handling through Python's mutable data structures. Overall, this is a clear and elegantly simple solution to the problem.
