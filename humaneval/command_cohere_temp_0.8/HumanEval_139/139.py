```python
def special_factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result //= factorial(i)
    return result

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```

This code defines two functions. The `special_factorial` function uses two different approaches to calculate the Brazilian factorial:
1. The first line uses a multiplication approach for the factorial calculation.
2. The second approach, used in the subsequent lines, uses the conventional formula for factorials where the result is divided by the factorial of each integer from 2 up to n.

The `factorial` function calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion and resets the value to 1 for base cases (factorial of 0). 

Both functions are self-contained and can accurately calculate the Brazilian factorial based on the provided problem definition.
