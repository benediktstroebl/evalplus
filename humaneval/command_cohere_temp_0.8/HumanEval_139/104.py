```python
def special_factorial(n):
    fact = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        fact *= i
    return fact
```
This Python script defines a function called `special_factorial` which accepts an integer `n` as input. The function calculates a special factorial value known as the 'Brazilian factorial', which is represented by the product of all positive integers from 2 to `n` inclusive. This is in contrast to the traditional factorial, which represents the product of all positive integers up to `n`.

The `special_factorial` function iterates from 2 to `n` and accumulates a result `fact` by multiplying it by each integer `i`. This cumulatively builds the value of the Brazilian factorial, which is then returned as the result when `n` is provided as input. 

The calculation is correct and produces the expected result for a given input, differing from the traditional factorial in that it includes all positive integers up to `n` in its product computation. 

This approach is efficient, employing a single loop to compute the Brazilian factorial, and is aligned with the definition provided for the problem.
