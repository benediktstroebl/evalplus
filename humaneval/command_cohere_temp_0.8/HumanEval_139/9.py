```python
def special_factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```
This Python script defines a function called `special_factorial` which accepts an integer `n` as input. This function calculates the `brazilian_factorial` of `n` by iterating through all numbers from 1 to `n` and multiplying them together. This multiplication process begins with 1 and continues up to the provided integer `n`, effectively computing the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. The final computed value is then returned as the result of the function. 

In the provided code snippet, the `special_factorial` function is implemented using a loop that iterates through the range of numbers from 1 to `n`. During each iteration, the current value of `i` is multiplied by the evolving result value, initialized to 1. This iterative process effectively calculates the product of all integers from 1 to n, yielding the result of the special factorial function.

Note that this implementation is not the most efficient way to calculate the factorial, as it uses a loop and does not take advantage of the mathematical properties of factorials. A more efficient implementation would use a recursive or memoization approach. However, this version is simple and straightforward, easy to understand, and correct for the given problem.
