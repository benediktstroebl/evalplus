Here's a Python script that defines the `brazilian_factorial` function, as per the problem statement:
```python
def special_factorial(n):
    product = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        product *= i
    return product
```

This script provides an efficient Python function that calculates the `brazilian_factorial` using a simple loop. The function receives an integer `n` as an argument and returns the corresponding `brazilian_factorial`. 

To execute the code simply run the script. You can also import the function into your code and use it with the `special_factorial` function. 

This approach provides a straightforward way to compute the Brazilian factorial and is adaptable to various scenarios. Let me know if you would like me to assist with any further adaptations or provide additional insights!
