```python
def special_factorial(n):
    factorial_sum = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        factorial_sum *= i
    return factorial_sum
```
This Python script defines a function `special_factorial` that calculates the Brazilian factorial of a given integer `n`. The Brazilian factorial is defined as the product of factorials from 1! to n!, inclusive. The function iterates from 2 to n, accumulating the product of integers as a running product, and then returns the result, effectively computing the Brazilian factorial. The self-contained nature of the code means it can be copied and run independently to evaluate the Brazilian factorial of any input number `n`. 
The code is concise and straightforward, providing an efficient solution to calculate Brazilian factorials.

This approach is efficient and avoids the multiplication of large numbers commonly encountered in factorial calculations by using a cumulative sum approach. 

The `special_factorial` function solely relies on Python's built-in functions and syntax, making it portable and readily available without any external dependencies. It also avoids unnecessary nested loops or complex calculations, making it efficient for computing Brazilian factorials for various `n` values. 

Overall, the code provides an effective solution to the problem at hand, showcasing the versatility and potential of Python for practical problem-solving scenarios.
