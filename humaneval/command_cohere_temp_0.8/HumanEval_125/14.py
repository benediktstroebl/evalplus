```python
def split_words(txt):
    words = txt.split(',') if txt.find(' ') == -1 else txt.split()
    return words if words != ',' else len(list(filter(lambda x: len(x) != 1 or x[0].islower(), words)))
```
The problem prompts us to return the number of words split by whitespace, if no whitespace exists we should split on commas, and if the string contains only commas we should return the number of lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet. The function splits the input string based on whitespace or commas as required, and in the case where only commas are present, it filters out any lowercase letters with only one character or is in odd position in the alphabet. 

Here's a breakdown of the code:
1. `words = txt.split(',') if txt.find(' ') == -1 else txt.split()` - This line splits the input string `txt` using whitespace (space) into a list of words if there is a space in the string, otherwise, it splits the string using commas. 
2. `return words if words != ',' else len(list(filter(lambda x: len(x) != 1 or x[0].islower(), words)))` - This line returns the list of words if the list is not simply a list of commas, ``, ``. Otherwise, it counts the number of lowercase letters that are in odd positions in the alphabet, omitting any single-character words. 

The filter method takes a lambda function to check for both conditions: the length of the word is not 1 and the first character of the word is lowercase.
