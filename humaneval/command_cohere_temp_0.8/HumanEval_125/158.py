```python
def split_words(txt):
    ans = txt.split(',') if ',' in txt else txt.split() if ' ' in txt else len(list(filter(lambda c: ord(c) ^ 1, txt.lower())))
    return ans
```

The problem prompts to return the list of words split on whitespace if such whitespace exists. However, if no whitespace is present in the text, the string should be split on commas. In the unlikely case where both commas and whitespace are absent, the function should return the number of lowercase letters with odd alphabetical order. This is achieved by using a filter function to select letters with an odd order when subtracting 1 from their corresponding ASCII code.

The provided solution uses string splitting functions comprehensively achieving the prompt's goals.
