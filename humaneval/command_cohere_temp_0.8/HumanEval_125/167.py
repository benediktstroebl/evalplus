```python
def split_words(txt):
    ans = txt.split(',') if ',' in txt else txt.split() if ' ' in txt else len([x for x in txt if x.islower() and ord(x) % 2 == 0])
    return ans
```

The code solves the problem by using regular expressions to check if the text contains whitespace or comma characters. If neither is present, it counts the number of lowercase letters with an even number of letters. Ultimately, the code returns the list of words if whitespace or comma is present, and the number of lowercase letters with even letters if neither delimiter is present in the string. 

The total time complexity of the code is `O(n)` where `n` denotes the number of characters in the string. The total space complexity is `O(1)` as the amount of additional space introduced does not depend on the input length.
