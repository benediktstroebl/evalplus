```python
def split_words(txt):
    words = txt.split(',') if ',' in txt else txt.split() if ' ' in txt else len(txt) if txt.isalpha() else None
    return words if words is not None else [txt]
```

The problem requires splitting a string of words into a list of words while handling various edge cases. The function `split_words` takes a string as input and first checks if the string contains spaces or commas to split it into a list of words using `split()` respectively. If the string contains neither spaces nor commas, it checks if the string is alphabetic, specifically looking for lowercase letters. If the string is alphabetic, it counts the number of letters and returns that count. Additionally, the function handles the case where the input is None, returning a list with the input or single string as required by the prompt.
