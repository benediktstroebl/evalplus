```python
def split_words(txt):
    words = txt.split(',') if ',' in txt else txt.split() if ' ' in txt else len([c for c in txt if c.islower() and ord(c) % 2 == 0])
    return words
```

The code solves the problem by performing the following steps:
1. Checks if the string `txt` contains a comma ',' by using the condition `if ',' in txt`. If true, it splits the string into a list of words based on the comma.
2. If the above condition is false, it checks if the string contains whitespace ' ' by using the condition `if ' ' in txt`. If true, it splits the string into a list of words based on whitespace.
3. If both conditions are false, it checks the length of the list of lowercase letters with even ordinal values in the string. The list is created using a generator expression in the form of `[c for c in txt if c.islower() and ord(c) % 2 == 0]`. The `islower()` method checks if a string consists of only lowercase letters, and the `ord()` function converts a character to its Unicode code point which by default returns a value in the range of 0-65535 which can be treated as a number. The modulus operator `%` gives a remainder of a division operation which in this case is used to check if a number is even or odd. The line returns the length of the list which is the required answer. 

The code is structured in a way that it will follow the flow of conditions and execute the first applicable step from the list above, where applicable means applicable based on the logic of the conditionals.

Note: The code assumes that the input string `txt` is a sequence of characters, numbers, or symbols surrounded by quotes, with no leading or trailing whitespace outside the quotes. Also, the code assumes that the quote marks used in the string are standard single or double quotes (' or ").

The approach makes use of Python's in built-ins methods and follows the PEP 8 style guide which is a recommended practice for writing readable and maintainable code. 

The problem can be solved in a single line of code but for readability purposes and to make the code accessible for different levels of programmers to understand and reason with, the given solution is split into readable and self-descriptive lines.
