```python
def get_odd_collatz(n):
    odd_seq = [x for x in map(lambda x: x if x % 2 else x * 2, incubate(n)) if x % 2 == 1]
    return sorted(odd_seq)

def incubate(n):
    yield n if n == 1 else (3 * n + 1 if n % 2 else n // 2)
```

The function `get_odd_collatz(n)` uses a list comprehension that filters odd numbers from the incubating sequence generated by the function `incubate(n)` for the given `n`. 

The function `incubate(n)` is a generator function laced with a `yield` statement, it provides a sequence of numbers that abide by the rules of the [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture). Yielding `n` if `n` is 1, otherwise it yields `(3 * n + 1)` if `n` is even, and `n // 2` if `n` is odd.

The odd numbers are filtered and collected in the list `odd_seq` and are sorted using the `sorted()` function to ensure their ascending order.

The generator approach is used for performance reasons to avoid generating the entire sequence at once, as this would be very memory-intensive for large inputs. Instead, the generator produces the next number in the sequence one at a time, only keeping one number in memory at a time. 

This solution is efficient and suitable for handling large inputs while keeping the codebase concise and understandable.  It is important to note that the Collatz conjecture is an unproven statement, however, the provided code abides by its definition for the exploration of its odd numbers.
