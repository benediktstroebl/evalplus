```python
def get_odd_collatz(n):
    odd_seq = [x for x in map(int, str(n)) if x % 2 == 1]
    collatz_seq = [x for x in map(int, str(n)) if x != 1]
    return sorted(odd_seq + [x for x in collatz_seq if x % 2 == 1])
```

This Python script provides a function `get_odd_collatz(n)` that aims to return a sorted list of odd numbers in the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer `n`. Here's how it works:
1. The function starts by generating an array `odd_seq` using a list comprehension. This array contains all the odd integers when the string representation of the input `n` is converted to an integer. This ensures that `odd_seq` contains integers like `5` from `n = 525`.
2. Next, it creates another array `collatz_seq`. This time, it includes all the integers when converting the string representation of `n` to an integer, but excluding `1` since the Collatz sequence never includes it. This array represents the entire Collatz sequence for the input `n`.
3. The function then returns a sorted list that concatenates `odd_seq` and the odd numbers from `collatz_seq`. The list is sorted in increasing order, as stipulated in the note in the prompt.

This solution is efficient since it creates both `odd_seq` and `collatz_seq` only once, and then operates on these arrays directly, rather than repeatedly generating them for every integer in the Collatz sequence.
