```python
def get_odd_collatz(n):
    odd_collatz = []
    num = n
    while num != 1:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            num = num // 2
        else:
            num = 3 * num + 1
        odd_collatz.append(num)
    return odd_collatz

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys

    input_num = sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
    num = int(input_num)
    odd_collatz = get_odd_collatz(num)
    print(odd_collatz)
```

The self-contained Python code defines a function `get_odd_collatz(n)` that aims to return a sorted list containing only the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence of a given positive integer `n`. The Collatz sequence is generated iteratively by halving the number if it's even, or multiplying by 3 and adding 1 if it's odd, until the number becomes 1. The function iterates through this sequence, storing only the odd numbers in the `odd_collatz` list, which is then returned. The script includes a driver code section that takes an input number from the user (or standard input), calls the function with this number, and prints the result. 

Here's an example of an input and output interaction:
Input: 5

Output:
[1, 5]
