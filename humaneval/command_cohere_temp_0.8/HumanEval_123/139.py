```python
def get_odd_collatz(n):
    odd_collatz = [1]
    while len(odd_collatz) < len(str(n)): 
        if odd_collatz[-1] % 2 == 0:
            odd_collatz.append(odd_collatz[-1] // 2)
        else:
            odd_collatz.append(3 * odd_collatz[-1] + 1)
    return odd_collatz
```

The `get_odd_collatz` function uses an iterative approach to calculate the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence, which are appended to the `odd_collatz` list. The loop continues until the length of the list is greater than the length of the string representation of the input number `n`, ensuring that the list contains at least one element for each digit in the decimal representation of `n`.

The `if` statement inside the loop checks whether the last number in the sequence is even or odd, and it updates the `odd_collatz` list accordingly. If the number is even, it is divided by 2, and if it is odd, it is multiplied by 3 and added to 1.

This algorithm's time complexity is not examined, but it is dependent on the length of the Collatz sequence, which is roughly proportional to the number of digits in the input number `n`. Thus, the time complexity is O(dig_n), where `dig_n` represents the number of digits in `n`.

The Collatz sequence for `1` is `[1]`, hence the list is returned with only the element `1` if `n` is `1`. This behavior is noted in the note section of the problem statement.
