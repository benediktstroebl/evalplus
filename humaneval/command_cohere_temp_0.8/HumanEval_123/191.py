```python
def get_odd_collatz(n):
    odd_seq = [y for y in collatz_sequence(n) if y % 2 == 1]
    return sorted(odd_seq)

def collatz_sequence(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [1]
    else:
        even_seq = collatz_sequence(n // 2)
        odd_seq = collatz_sequence(3 * n + 1)
        return even_seq + odd_seq
```

The `collatz_sequence` function recursively calculates the sequence, and the `get_odd_collatz` function filters and sorts the odd numbers from the sequence. This approach ensures that the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence for any given input `n` are returned. Let's continue with some examples to further test this function and understand its behavior:
```python
# Test the function with a variety of inputs
print(get_odd_collatz(1))         # Should print [1]
print(get_odd_collatz(2))         # Should print []
print(get_odd_collatz(3))         # Should print [1, 3]
print(get_odd_collatz(4))         # Should print [1, 4]
print(get_odd_collatz(5))         # Should print [1, 5]
print(get_odd_collatz(6))         # Should print [3, 6]
print(get_odd_collatz(7))         # Should print [1, 7]
print(get_odd_collatz(8))         # Should print [1, 8]
print(get_odd_collatz(9))         # Should print [1, 9]
print(get_odd_collatz(10))        # Should print [5, 10]
```

These examples should all return the expected results based on the Collatz sequence, which is a sequence of numbers where each number is either one-half of the previous even number or three times the previous odd number plus one. The sequence continues until it reaches the base case of `n` equal to one.
