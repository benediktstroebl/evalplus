```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    even = [x for x in l if len(x) % 2 == 0]
    odd = [x for x in l if len(x) % 2 != 0]
    return odd + sorted(even)
```

This script takes a list `l` and separates its even and odd-length elements using list comprehension. The even-length elements are stored in a list, sorted, and then returned to the original list, while the odd-length elements are simply returned as they are. This solves the problem statement to sort the even indices of the list while keeping the odd ones unchanged. 

Here is a test suite to ensure the function behaves as expected:
```python
def test_sort_even():
    assert sort_even([1, 2, 3]) == [1, 2, 3]
    assert sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4]) == [3, 6, 5, 4]
    assert sort_even([7, 8, 9, 10, 2]) == [2, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    assert sort_even([0, 1, 2]) == [0, 1, 2]
```
