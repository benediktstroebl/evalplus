```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    even = [x for x in l if len(x) % 2 == 0]
    odd = [x for x in l if len(x) % 2 != 0]
    return odd + sorted(even)
```

This Python script defines a function called `sort_even`, which takes a list `l` as input. It separates the list into even and odd-length elements using list comprehensions and then returns the odd elements followed by a sorted version of the even elements. This behavior is illustrated in the docstring's examples, showcasing how the function processes lists of various lengths.
