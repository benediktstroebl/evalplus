```python
def sort_even(l):
    even = l[::2]
    odd = l[1::2]
    return even + sorted(odd)
```

The function `sort_even` takes a list as an argument and returns a list containing the original odd indices and sorted even indices. The code first extracts the even indices as a sequence using the `::2` index, and the odd indices as a sequence using the `1::2` index. Then, the code creates the return list by concatenating the sorted even index sequence and the original odd index sequence using the `+` operator.

Here is a test case that can be used to verify the function:
```python
test_cases = [[1, 2, 3], [5, 6, 3, 4]]

for case in test_cases:
    assert sort_even(case) == case
```

This provides a straightforward solution in an easy-to-understand way, as it does not require any additional data structures such as nested lists. It is also efficient as it only requires one pass through the list to sort the even indices. 

If you would like to test the function with more complex use cases, you can try increasing the complexity of the test_cases list. Feel free to modify the function as well if you are looking for more practical implementations. Let me know if you have any questions!
