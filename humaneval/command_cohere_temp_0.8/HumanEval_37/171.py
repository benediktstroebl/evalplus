```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    even = [x for x in l if len(x) % 2 == 0]
    odd = [x for x in l if len(x) % 2 != 0]
    return odd + sorted(even)
```

This Python script defines a function called `sort_even`, which takes a list of items as input. It filters out the even index elements from the list and sorts them. Then, it combines these sorted even elements with the original odd index elements to create a new list. The function essentially splits the list into even and odd index elements, sorts the even elements, and then merges them back together. The result is a list where the odd index elements remain unchanged, while the even index elements are sorted. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
result = sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])
print(result)  # Output: [3, 6, 5, 4]
```

The resulting list is [3, 6, 5, 4]. The even index elements (4 and 6) have been sorted, while the odd index elements (5 and 3) remain unchanged.
