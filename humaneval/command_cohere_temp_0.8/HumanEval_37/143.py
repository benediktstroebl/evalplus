```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    even = [e for e in l if e % 2 == 0]
    odd = [o for o in l if o % 2 != 0]
    even = sorted(even)
    return odd + even
```

The function 'sort_even' takes a list called 'l' as an argument. It uses list comprehension to split the list 'l' into two lists: 'even' and 'odd'. 'even' contains all elements of the list 'l' that have an even parity (i.e., their remainder of the division by 2 is 0). The 'odd' list contains the elements of 'l' that have an odd parity. 

Then, the script sorts the 'even' list alphabetically and returns the 'odd' list concatenated with the 'even' list, thus achieving the desired result. 

The script assumes that the input list 'l' contains at least one element. If the list is empty, the function should be edited to handle this case explicitly (e.g., by returning an empty list). 

This solution is robust and efficient, sorting the list elements at even indices without altering the original odd indices' elements while utilizing the sorted() function's efficiency.
