```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    even = [x for x in l if len(x) % 2 == 0]
    odd = [x for x in l if len(x) % 2 != 0]
    return odd + sorted(even)
```

This Python script defines a function called `sort_even`, which takes a list of items as input. It filters out the even index elements from the list and sorts them. Then, it returns a new list consisting of the odd index elements from the original list combined with the sorted even index elements. This behavior is illustrated in the example tests, where the function is applied to two lists containing mixed odd and even length elements. The function returns the original list for the first example, since all elements are odd. However, in the second example, it correctly sorts the even index elements 6 and 4, while keeping the odd index element 5 intact.
