```python
def sort_even(l):
    even = l[::2]
    odd = l[1::2]
    return even + sorted(odd)
```

The function 'sort_even' takes a list as an argument and returns a list with the odd indices intact and the even indices sorted. To do this, the function creates two new lists: 'even' and 'odd', which comprise the even and odd indices of the original list, respectively. Then, the function returns the original list with the even indices sorted, obtained by concatenating the sorted 'odd' list with the original 'even' list.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
test_list = [1, 4, 3, 7, 2, 5, 6]
print(sort_even(test_list))  # Expected output: [1, 3, 4, 7, 2, 5, 6]
``` 

This will output the following list, which is the same as the input list, except the even indices are sorted in ascending order.
