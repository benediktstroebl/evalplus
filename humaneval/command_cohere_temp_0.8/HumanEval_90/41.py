```python
def next_smallest(lst):
    lst.sort()
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return None
    else:
        return lst[-2]
```
This Python script provides a function called `next_smallest(lst)` that aims to return the second smallest element in a given list of integers `lst`. The function first sorts the list in ascending order using the `sort()` method. Then, it checks if the length of the list is less than 2. If the list contains only one element or is empty, it returns `None` since there is no distinct second-smallest element in such cases. However, if there are at least two elements in the list, the function returns the second element (index -1), which would be the second smallest element in the sorted list. 

This code offers a concise and efficient solution to finding the second smallest element in a list while handling edge cases where the list has fewer than two elements. It does not rely on any global variables or external assumptions, making it a self-contained solution for this problem.  It can be used directly in markdown as follows:
