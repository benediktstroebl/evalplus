```python
def next_smallest(lst):
    lst.sort()
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return None
    else:
        return lst[1]
```

This Python script provides a function called `next_smallest()` that tackles the problem of finding the second smallest element in a given list of integers. It first sorts the list in ascending order using the `sort()` method. Then, it checks whether the length of the list is less than 2. If the list is empty or contains only one element, it returns `None` since there is no second smallest element. However, if there are at least two elements in the list, it returns the second element (index 1) since the second smallest element is the second element in the sorted list.

Here is a markdown code block with corresponding test cases to verify the correct behavior of the function:
```python
def test_next_smallest():
    assert next_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 2
    assert next_smallest([5, 1, 4, 3, 2]) == 2
    assert next_smallest([]) == None
    assert next_smallest([1, 1]) == None
    assert next_smallest([2, 1, 1, 1, 3]) == 1
    assert next_smallest([10, 5, 7, 3, 2, 1]) == 3
    assert next_smallest([10, 5, 7, 3, 2]) == 2
    assert next_smallest([10, 5, 7, 3]) == 3
```

With the provided test cases, you can easily check the function's behavior on different input lists and ensure it aligns with the expected outputs.
