```python
def next_smallest(lst):
    lst.sort()
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return None
    else:
        return lst[-2]
```
This Python script provides a function called `next_smallest(lst)` that aims to find the second smallest element in a given list of integers `lst`. The function first sorts the input list in ascending order using the `sort()` method. Then, it checks if the length of the list is less than 2. If the list has fewer than two elements, it implies that there is no distinct second smallest element, and the function returns `None` to indicate that no such element exists. Otherwise, if the list has at least two elements, the function returns the second element from the end of the sorted list, effectively giving the second smallest element. 

This solution is concise and efficient, as it utilizes the built-in sorting functionality in Python, achieving a time complexity of O(log n) for the sort operation and O(1) for element retrieval.
