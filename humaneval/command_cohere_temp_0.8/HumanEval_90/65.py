```python
def next_smallest(lst):
    lst.sort()
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return None
    else:
        return lst[-2]
```
This approach takes advantage of Python's built-in sorting functionality to easily identify the second smallest element in the list, without the need for explicit looping constructs. The preliminary sorting step also helps maintain clarity and efficiency, especially when dealing with larger or more complex datasets.
