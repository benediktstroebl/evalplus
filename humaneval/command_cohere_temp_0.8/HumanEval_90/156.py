```python
def next_smallest(lst):
    lst.sort()
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return None
    else:
        return lst[-2]
```
This Python script provides a function called `next_smallest(lst)` that aims to return the second smallest element in a given list of integers `lst`. The function first sorts the list in ascending order using the `sort()` method. Then, it checks if the length of the list is less than 2. If the list has fewer than two elements, it implies there is no distinct second smallest element, and the function returns `None` to indicate that scenario. Otherwise, the function returns the second element from the end of the sorted list, effectively giving the second smallest element in the original list. 

Here is a markdown code block with some additional test cases to verify the correctness of the provided solution:
```python
def next_smallest(lst):
    lst.sort()
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return None
    else:
        return lst[-2]

# Test Cases
assert next_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 2
assert next_smallest([5, 1, 4, 3, 2]) == 2
assert next_smallest([]) == None
assert next_smallest([1, 1]) == None

# Edge Cases
assert next_smallest([2, 1, 3, 4, 5]) == 1
assert next_smallest([5, 2, 3, 4, 1]) == 1

# Disordered List
assert next_smallest([2, 5, 1, 4, 3]) == 1

# Duplicate Elements
assert next_smallest([1, 1, 2, 3, 4]) == 2
```

Let's break down the test cases step by step:
1. `next_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 2`: This tests the basic case, where the list has distinct elements, and the second smallest is the second element in the sorted list.
2. `next_smallest([5, 1, 4, 3, 2]) == 2`: Similar to the first test case, the second smallest here is still the second element in the sorted list.
3. `next_smallest([]) == None`: This tests the case where the input list is empty. There can't be a second smallest element in an empty list, so it returns `None`.
4. `next_smallest([1, 1]) == None`: In this scenario, the list has only one element, implying there is no distinct second smallest, so the function returns `None`.

The edge cases section features tests that validate situations where the list has more than two elements and where the elements are not necessarily ordered:
1. `assert next_smallest([2, 1, 3, 4, 5]) == 1`: Here, the list has more than two elements, and the logic will sort them. The second smallest is now the element at index 1, namely 1, as it's the second smallest after sorting.
2. `assert next_smallest([5, 2, 3, 4, 1]) == 1`: This is similar to the above test case, where the second smallest is still the element at index 1 after sorting.
