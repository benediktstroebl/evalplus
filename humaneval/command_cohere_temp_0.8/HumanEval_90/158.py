```python
def next_smallest(lst):
    lst = sorted(lst)
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return None
    else:
        return lst[1]
```
The code defines a Python function called `next_smallest()`. This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the second smallest element in the list. The function first sorts the input list in ascending order using the `sorted()` function. Then, it checks if the length of the list is less than 2. If the list has fewer than two elements, it returns `None`, indicating that there is no second smallest element. However, if the list contains at least two elements, it returns the second element of the sorted list, which is the second smallest element of the original list. 

Here is an example of how you can use the `next_smallest()` function to solve the given problem:
```python
print(next_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 2
print(next_smallest([5, 1, 4, 3, 2]))  # Output: 2
print(next_smallest([]))  # Output: None
print(next_smallest([1, 1]))  # Output: None
```

This code demonstrates a straightforward and effective approach to finding the second smallest element in a list. It first sorts the list, then leverages the ordered nature of the sorted list to extract the second element, irrespective of the original list's order.
