```python
def next_smallest(lst):
    lst.sort()
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return None
    else:
        return lst[1]
```

This function leverages Python's built-in `sorted()` function to sort the list, thereby determining the second smallest element. If the list has less than two elements, it returns `None` to account for the lack of a second smallest element. 

The following test cases can be used to verify the function's behavior:
```python
print(next_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])) # Should print 2
print(next_smallest([5, 1, 4, 3, 2])) # Should print 2
print(next_smallest([])) # Should print None
print(next_smallest([1, 1])) # Should print None
```

This script will execute the above behavior, helping solve the problem as outlined.
