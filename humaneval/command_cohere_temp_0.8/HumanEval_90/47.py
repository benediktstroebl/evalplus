```python
def next_smallest(lst):
    lst.sort()
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return None
    else:
        return lst[-2]
```
This Python script provides a function called `next_smallest(lst)` that aims to return the second smallest element in a given list of integers `lst`. First, the list is sorted in ascending order using the `sort()` method. Then, the function checks if the length of the list is less than 2. In that case, returning the second smallest element is not possible since there are not enough elements to form a list of two or more elements, so the function returns `None`. Otherwise, the function returns the second element in the sorted list, which is the second smallest element in the original list. 

Here is a markdown code block with some additional tests to further illustrate this function:
```python
def next_smallest(lst):
    lst.sort()
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return None
    else:
        return lst[-2]

# Tests
li = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(f"next_smallest({li}) == 2")

li = [5, 1, 4, 3, 2]
print(f"next_smallest({li}) == 2")

li = []
print(f"next_smallest({li}) == None")

li = [1, 1]
print(f"next_smallest({li}) == None")

li = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(f"next_smallest({li}) == 3")

li = [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
print(f"next_smallest({li}) == 2")
```

This shows that the function `next_smallest` behaves as expected with different test cases.
