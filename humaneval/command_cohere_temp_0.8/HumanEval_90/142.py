```python
def next_smallest(lst):
    lst.sort()
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return None
    else:
        return lst[-2]
```
This Python script provides a function called `next_smallest(lst)` that aims to find the second smallest element in a given list of integers (`lst`). The function first sorts the input list in ascending order using the built-in `sort()` method. Then, it checks whether the length of the list is less than 2. If the list has fewer than two elements, it implies there is no distinct second smallest element, so the function returns `None` to indicate that no such element exists. 

However, if the list contains at least two elements, the function retrieves the second smallest element by accessing the second-to-last element in the sorted list using `lst[-2]`. This element will be the second smallest in terms of ascending order. 

The function returns either `None` or the second smallest element, depending on the contents and length of the input list.
