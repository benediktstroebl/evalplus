```python
def next_smallest(lst):
    lst.sort()
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return None
    else:
        return lst[-2]
```
This approach employs the Python built-in `sorted()` function to arrange the list in ascending order. Subsequently, it verifies whether the size of the list is fewer than 2, returning `None` if so to indicate the absence of a second smallest element. Conversely, if the list encompasses at least two items, it returns the second element from the sorted list. 

Here is a test suite to ensure the function behaves as expected:
```python
def test_next_smallest():
    assert next_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 2
    assert next_smallest([5, 1, 4, 3, 2]) == 2
    assert next_smallest([]) is None
    assert next_smallest([1, 1]) is None
    assert next_smallest([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) == 1
    assert next_smallest([2, 1, 3, 5, 4, 7, 6, 8, 9, 10]) == 1
    assert next_smallest([3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]) == 3
    assert next_smallest([10, 10, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]) == 10
    assert next_smallest([25, 29, 31, 24, 27, 26, 23, 19, 21, 22]) == 24
```

You can implement this test suite and run it using a Python compiler to ensure the function behaves as expected.
