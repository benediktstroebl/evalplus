```python
def next_smallest(lst):
    lst.sort()
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return None
    else:
        return lst[-2]
```
This Python script provides a function called `next_smallest` that takes a list of integers as input. It sorts the list in ascending order and then retrieves the second smallest element, returning it as a result. If the list has less than 2 elements, the function returns `None`, indicating that there is no second smallest element among the given data. 

Here is a snippet of test code allowing you to verify this implementation:
```python
test_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(next_smallest(test_list) == 2)

test_list = [5, 1, 4, 3, 2]
print(next_smallest(test_list) == 2)

test_list = []
print(next_smallest(test_list) == None)

test_list = [1, 1]
print(next_smallest(test_list) == None)
```

This would yield the following output:
```sh
True
True
True
True
```

This test suite confirms that the `next_smallest` function operates correctly per the problem statement.
