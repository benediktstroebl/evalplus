```python
def fix_spaces(text):
    new_text = []
    for c in text:
        if c == ' ':
            if len(new_text) > 1 and new_text[-1] == ' ':
                new_text.append('-')
            else:
                new_text.append('_')
        else:
            new_text.append(c)
    return ''.join(new_text)
``` 

The Python script fixes spaces in the given string and provides different behaviors for a single space and multiple consecutive spaces. You can test this function with the provided test cases to ensure it behaves as expected. Let's explain this code further:
1. **Iterating Over Text**: The code uses a for loop to iterate over each character in the input text. This allows it to examine each character and make decisions based on its content. 
2. **Handling Single Space Character**: When the current character is a space, the code checks the previous character. If the previous character is also a space, it means there are multiple spaces, and in this case, the code appends a `-` to the `new_text` list. This effectively replaces consecutive spaces with hyphens. 
3. **Handling Non Space Characters**: When the current character is not a space, the code appends the character as it is to the `new_text` list. This ensures that non-space characters are not modified. 
4. **Joining and Returning**: After processing all characters in the text, the code joins the `new_text` list into a single string and returns it. This provides the modified text with fixed spaces where needed. 

This function ensures that all single spaces are appropriately replaced with underscores and that all consecutive spaces are replaced with hyphens.
