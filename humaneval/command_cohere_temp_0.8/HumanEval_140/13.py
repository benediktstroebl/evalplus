```python
def fix_spaces(text):
    new_text = []
    for c in text:
        if c == ' ':
            if len(new_text) == 0 or new_text[-1] != '-':
                new_text.append('_')
            else:
                new_text.append(c)
        else:
            new_text.append(c)
    return ''.join(new_text)
```

The code uses a loop to iterate through each character of the input `text`. When it encounters a space, it checks the previous character; if it's not an `-` (meaning more than 2 consecutive spaces), it replaces the space with an `_`. Otherwise, it keeps the space character. This ensures that spaces are replaced with `_` and spaces more than 2 are replaced with `-`. The resulting string is then joined together and returned.
