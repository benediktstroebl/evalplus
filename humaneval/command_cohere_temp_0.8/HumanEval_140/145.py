```python
def fix_spaces(text):
    new_text = []
    for c in text:
        if c == ' ':
            if len(new_text) > 1 and new_text[-1] == ' ':
                new_text.append('-')
            else:
                new_text.append('_')
        else:
            new_text.append(c)
    return ''.join(new_text)
``` 

The code uses a for loop to iterate through each character in the input `text`. When it encounters a space, it checks the previous character; if the previous character is also a space, it means there are more than 2 consecutive spaces, so it replaces the spaces with a `-`. Otherwise, it replaces the space with an `_`. For all other characters, it is appended as it is. Finally, the function returns the resulting string `new_text`. 

The problem statement can be modified to test this code as follows:
```python
def test_fix_spaces():
    # basic tests
    assert fix_spaces("Example") == "Example"
    assert fix_spaces("Example 1") == "Example_1"
    assert fix_spaces(" Example 2") == "_Example_2"
    assert fix_spaces(" Example   3") == "_Example-3"
    assert fix_spaces("   Example 4") == "_Example-4"

    # test with multiple occurrences of multiple spaces
    assert fix_spaces("    Example    5") == "_Example-5"
    assert fix_spaces("  Example  6") == "_Example_6"
    assert fix_spaces(" Example  7") == "_Example_7"

    # test with Chinese characters
    assert fix_spaces("例子 1") == "例子_1"
    assert fix_spaces("  例子 2") == "__例子_2"
    assert fix_spaces("例子 3") == "例子_3"

    print("All tests passed!")
``` 

This will generate a markdown code block with the Python code and instructions on how to run the test suite.
