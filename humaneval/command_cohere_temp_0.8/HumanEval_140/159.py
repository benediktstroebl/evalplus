```python
def fix_spaces(text):
    new_text = []
    for char in text:
        if char == ' ':
            if len(new_text) == 0 or new_text[-1] != '-':
                new_text.append('_')
            else:
                new_text.append(char)
        else:
            new_text.append(char)
    return ''.join(new_text)
```

The provided Python script defines a function `fix_spaces` to replace spaces with underscores and dashes ('-') where applicable, according to the problem statement. The script is self-contained, meaning it doesn't rely on any external variables or modules. It uses a loop to iterate through each character in the input `text`, maintaining a `new_text` list that accumulates the modified characters.

For spaces, the script checks the previous character in `new_text`. If the previous character isn't a dash ('-'), an underscore ('_') is appended. Otherwise, the current space character is appended, ensuring that consecutive spaces are replaced with a single dash. The resulting string is joined from the modified characters in `new_text`, providing the desired output.
