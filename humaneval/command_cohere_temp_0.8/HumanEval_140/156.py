```python
def fix_spaces(text):
    new_text = []
    for char in text:
        if char == ' ':
            if len(new_text) > 1 and new_text[-1] == ' ' and new_text[-2] == ' ':
                new_text.append('-')
            else:
                new_text.append('_')
        else:
            new_text.append(char)
    return ''.join(new_text)
``` 

The code uses a list to build the new string, ensuring that all spaces are correctly replaced. The check for consecutive spaces is also implemented through list manipulation within the loop. This ensures that each space is replaced according to the problem's specifications.
