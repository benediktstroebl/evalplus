```python
def fix_spaces(text):
    new_text = []
    for c in text:
        if c == ' ':
            if len(new_text) == 0 or new_text[-1] != '-':
                new_text.append('_')
            else:
                new_text.append(c)
        else:
            new_text.append(c)
    return ''.join(new_text)
```

The code uses a loop to iterate through each character in the `text` string. When it encounters a space, it checks the previous character; if it's not an `-` (meaning more than 2 consecutive spaces), it replaces the space with an `_`, otherwise, it keeps the space. This ensures that spaces are replaced with `_` if there are less than 3 consecutive spaces, and with `-` if there are 3 or more.
