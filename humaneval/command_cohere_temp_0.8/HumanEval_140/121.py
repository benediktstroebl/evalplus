```python
def fix_spaces(text):
    new_text = []
    for c in text:
        if c == ' ':
            if len(new_text) > 1 and new_text[-1] == ' ' and new_text[-2] == ' ':
                new_text.append('-')
            else:
                new_text.append('_')
        else:
            new_text.append(c)
    return ''.join(new_text)
``` 

The Python script fixes spaces in the given string and replaces them with underscores or hyphens, as per the problem statement. Let's break down the code:
1. **Function Definition**: We define a function `fix_spaces(text)` that takes a single argument, `text`, which is the input string to be cleaned up.
2. **List Comprehension**: The core of the cleaning process is a list comprehension. For each character `c` in the input `text`, it does the following:
   - If `c` is a space, it checks the previous two characters in the `new_text` list (which is being built). These are the last two characters in the cleaned string so far.
   - If the previous two characters are both spaces, it adds a hyphen `-` to the `new_text` list. This replaces the three consecutive spaces with a hyphen, as per the problem statement.
   - If the previous two characters are not both spaces, it adds an underscore `_` to the `new_text` list. This replaces single spaces with underscores, as per the problem statement.
3. **String Joining**: After processing all characters in the input, we use `'.join(new_text)'` to convert the cleaned list of characters back into a single string, which is then returned as the output of the function. 

This code will appropriately fix the spaces in the input string as per the rules provided in the problem statement.
