```python
def fix_spaces(text):
    new_text = []
    for c in text:
        if c == ' ':
            if len(new_text) == 0 or new_text[-1] != '-':
                new_text.append('_')
            else:
                new_text.append(c)
        else:
            new_text.append(c)
    return ''.join(new_text)
```

The function goes through each character of the input `text` and either appends an underscore or itself to the `new_text` list depending on the character being a space. If a hyphen is appended, the previous appended character was also a hyphen, as checked by the conditional `if len(new_text) == 0 or new_text[-1] != '-'`. 

This results in the desired output where all spaces are replaced with underscores and consecutive spaces are replaced with hyphens.
