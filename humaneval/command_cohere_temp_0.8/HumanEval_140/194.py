```python
def fix_spaces(text):
    new_text = []
    for c in text:
        if c == ' ':
            if len(new_text) > 1 and new_text[-1] == ' ' and new_text[-2] == ' ':
                new_text.append('-')
            else:
                new_text.append('_')
        else:
            new_text.append(c)
    return ''.join(new_text)
``` 

The code uses a list to build the new string, which is then joined to produce the final result. This method ensures that the spacing is correctly reconstructed, even with multiple consecutive spaces.
