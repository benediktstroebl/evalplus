```python
def fix_spaces(text):
    new_text = []
    for c in text:
        if c == ' ':
            if len(new_text) > 1 and new_text[-1] == ' ':
                new_text.append('-')
            else:
                new_text.append('_')
        else:
            new_text.append(c)
    return ''.join(new_text)
``` 

The code block above provides a Python script that solves the problem using a single function `fix_spaces(text)`. This function iterates over the input string `text` and checks if the current character is a space. If true, it checks to see if the last character added to the `new_text` list was also a space. If so, it replaces the two consecutive spaces with a single `-`, otherwise, it replaces the space with an underscore. All other characters are added to the string as is. This ensures that the expected outputs are achieved, as stated in the example cases of the problem.
