```python
def fix_spaces(text):
    new_text = []
    for c in text:
        if c == ' ':
            if len(new_text) == 0 or new_text[-1] != '-':
                new_text.append('_')
            else:
                new_text.append(c)
        else:
            new_text.append(c)
    return ''.join(new_text)
```

The code uses a simple loop to iterate through the input `text` and process each character accordingly. It checks if the current character is a space, it also checks the previous character to see if it was a `-` because we don't want to combine underscores with hyphens consecutively. If the previous character was not a `-`, we append an underscore to fix consecutive spaces, or add the current character if it's not a space. Otherwise, if the previous character was a `-`, we just add the current character (the hyphen) to the new text. Finally, we join the `new_text` list to form the final string and return the result. 

This approach ensures that all spaces are correctly replaced, and consecutives spaces are fixed with hyphens.
