```python
def fix_spaces(text):
    new_text = []
    for c in text:
        if c == ' ':
            if len(new_text) > 1 and new_text[-1] == ' ':
                new_text.append('-')
            else:
                new_text.append('_')
        else:
            new_text.append(c)
    return ''.join(new_text)
``` 

The given Python script defines a function `fix_spaces` that replaces all single spaces with underscores and double spaces with a hyphen in a given input text. This function effectively handles spaces and maintains the desired formatting when replacing consecutive spaces with special characters.

Here's a breakdown of the code:
1. It uses a loop to traverse each character of the input `text`.
2. Within the loop, it checks if the current character is a space.
3. If the current character is a space, it checks the previous character in the `new_text` list (the string being built to hold the fixed text). If the previous character is also a space, it means there are two or more consecutive spaces, so it replaces the current space with a hyphen. Otherwise, it replaces the current space with an underscore.
4. If the current character is not a space, it adds the character as it is to the `new_text` list.
5. After processing all characters, the function joins the `new_text` list to form a single string and returns it. 

This approach ensures that spaces are formatted as specified in the problem statement. The code is concise and efficient, making it a practical solution for this text replacement problem.
