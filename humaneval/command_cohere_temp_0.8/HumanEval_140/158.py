```python
def fix_spaces(text):
    new_text = []
    for c in text:
        if c == ' ':
            if len(new_text) == 0 or new_text[-1] != '-':
                new_text.append('_')
            else:
                new_text.append(c)
        else:
            new_text.append(c)
    return ''.join(new_text)
``` 

The Python script solves the problem by iterating through every character of the input text and determining whether it is a space or not. If it is a space, the script checks the previous character in the text to determine if it is also a space. If the previous character is not a space, an underscore is added to the new text variable, which is used to create the output text. However, if the previous character is a space, we check if it is also consecutive, meaning that the char before that was also a space. If that is the case, we replace the consecutive spaces with a -. In either case, we add the appropriate character to the new text variable. After iterating through all the characters in the input text, the script returns the new text joined into a single string. 

Here is an example usage of the fix_spaces function for the input "Example":
```python
print(fix_spaces("Example"))
```
This will output the string "Example" since the input string has only one space which is not consecutive. Here is an example usage of the fix_spaces function for the input "Example 1":
```python
print(fix_spaces("Example 1"))
```
This will output the string "Example_1" because the input string has one consecutive space, therefore it is replaced with an underscore. Here is an example usage of the fix_spaces function for the input " Example 2":
```python
print(fix_spaces(" Example 2"))
```
This will output the string "_Example_2" because the input string has two consecutive spaces, therefore they are replaced with two underscores. Here is an example usage of the fix_spaces function for the input " Example 3":
```python
print(fix_spaces(" Example 3"))
```
This will output the string "_Example_3" because the input string has two consecutive spaces, therefore they are replaced with two underscores. Here is an example usage of the fix_spaces function for the input " Example 4":
```python
print(fix_spaces(" Example 4"))
```
This will output the string "_Example-4" because the input string has three consecutive spaces, therefore they are replaced with a single -. Here is an example usage of the fix_spaces function for the input "Example 5":
```python
print(fix_spaces("Example 5"))
```
This will output the string "Example5" since the input string does not contain any spaces.
