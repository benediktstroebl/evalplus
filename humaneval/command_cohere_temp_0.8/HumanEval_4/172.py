Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script utilizes the numpy library to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation, which provides a robust and efficient solution. The function `mean_absolute_deviation` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the MAD value. 

To compute the Mean Absolute Deviation, the list of numbers is converted into a numpy array, and the absolute differences between each element and the mean of the array are calculated using the `np.abs()` and `np.mean()` functions, respectively. The result is the mean of these absolute differences, which is the Mean Absolute Deviation of the dataset. 

This approach provides a simple solution with the numerical robustness and efficiency that the numpy library offers. 
```python
mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]) #1.0
``` 
This will output: 
```
1.0
```

Note: Ensure the 'numpy' library is installed to utilize this script. If not, you can install it using `pip install numpy`.
