Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and calculates the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list. 

The `mean_absolute_deviation` function utilizes the NumPy library to perform vectorized operations on the input list of numbers. It first converts the input list to a NumPy array and calculates the mean of the array. Then, it subtracts the mean from each number in the array and calculates the absolute values of these differences, resulting in a new array of absolute deviations. Finally, it takes the mean of the absolute deviation array to return the Mean Absolute Deviation. 

This solution is relatively efficient and can handle large datasets efficiently utilizing NumPy's matrix operations.
