Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and calculates the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list. 

The `mean_absolute_deviation` function uses the `numpy` library to calculate the mean and absolute deviations efficiently. It removes the need for a separate loop and reduces the computational complexity. 

Finally, the `mean_absolute_deviation` function returns the mean absolute deviation, which provides a measure of the dispersion or variation of the dataset, giving insight into its spread from the mean. 

This approach ensures numerical stability and delivers accurate results for various scenarios. The function is self-contained and can be executed independently, making it reusable and easy to integrate into different projects needing similar statistical analysis. 

Note: Make sure numpy is installed in your environment to run this code successfully: `pip install numpy`
