Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script utilizes the `numpy` library, which provides a powerful array structure that performs the necessary calculations efficiently. To handle the absolute deviations, the `abs` function is applied element-wise to a copy of the difference array created using the subtraction operation (`-`) between the input array and the mean array. The resulting absolute deviation array is then returned as the final answer, representing the Mean Absolute Deviation for the given input `numbers`. 
It is important to note that the `numpy` array operations in the code are efficient and provide a robust approach for handling the calculations associated with the Mean Absolute Deviation.
