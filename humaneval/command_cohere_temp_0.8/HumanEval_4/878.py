Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
The function `mean_absolute_deviation` calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a list of numbers. It utilizes the `numpy` library to perform the necessary computations efficiently. First, it creates a numpy array from the input list of numbers. It then calculates the mean of the array and subtracts it from each number to get the deviations. Finally, it calculates the mean of the absolute deviations and returns the result. This approach is both concise and numerically stable, ensuring accurate results for a variety range of datasets. 
The test case for this function is written as:
```python
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
expected_result = 1.0

result = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)
assert result == expected_result
```
This test case verifies correct functionality of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function on a specific input list, checking if the output matches the expected result.
