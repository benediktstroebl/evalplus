Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script utilizes the numpy library, which provides a powerful array structure for numerical operations, to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers efficiently. The function `mean_absolute_deviation` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the MAD value. 

To understand the algorithm logic, let's break down the steps using a sample list of numbers such as `[1, 2, 3, 4]`:
1. `np.array(numbers)`: This step converts the input list into a numpy array, which allows us to perform advanced numerical operations more efficiently.
2. `np.mean(np.array(numbers))`: This calculates the mean (average) value of the numpy array, representing the centerpoint for deviation calculation.
3. `np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))):` This creates an array of absolute differences between each element and the mean. For our sample list, it would be `np.array([1, 1, 1, 1])` since each element has an absolute difference of 1 from the mean (mean == 2).
4. `np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers)))):` Finally, this calculates the mean of the absolute difference array, which provides the MAD value. 

These steps harness the power of numpy to efficiently calculate the MAD value for a list of numbers. Using this algorithm, theMAD value is obtained as the average absolute deviation from the mean, providing a robust measure of data variability in a dataset. 

This script successfully solves the problem statement provided and produces accurate MAD values for any given list of numbers.
