Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    :param numbers: List of input numbers
    :return: Mean Absolute Deviation
    """
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. 

The function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation, which is the average absolute difference between each element and the mean of the list. 

The NumPy library is utilized to perform efficient numerical operations, calculating the mean of the input array and then determining the absolute differences from the mean for each number, ultimately returning the mean of these absolute differences to provide the Mean Absolute Deviation value.  This is a widely recognized measure of dispersion or variation in a dataset, offering insight into how spread out the values are from the center.  It is a robust metric that is not sensitive to the distribution of outliers, making it particularly useful for datasets with divergent values.  This function can be used to assess the consistency or variability of data in a wide range of real-world scenarios, from scientific experiments to financial datasets.

The script enables users to easily compute Mean Absolute Deviation in their applications, providing a quick assessment of the data's dispersion.
