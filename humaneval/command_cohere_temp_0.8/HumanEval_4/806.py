Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and calculates the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list. 

The `mean_absolute_deviation` function leverages the Python `numpy` library to achieve this in an efficient manner. Here is how the function works:
- It imports the necessary modules, including 'List' from the 'typing' module to enable type-checking and 'np' (numpy) for numerical operations, and 'math' for basic mathematical functions.
- The function 'mean_absolute_deviation' takes a single argument, 'numbers', which is a list of float values.
- Inside the function, it creates a numpy array from the input list of numbers using `np.array(numbers)`. This conversion allows for efficient numerical operations.
- It calculates the mean of the numbers in the array using `np.mean(np.array(numbers))`. 
- This calculated mean is then used to center the data, and the absolute deviations from this center are calculated using `np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers)))`. 
- Finally, it returns the mean of these absolute deviations, which is the Mean Absolute Deviation for the given dataset. 

This solution uses the `numpy` library, which provides efficient and optimized functions for numerical operations. This allows for a concise and efficient solution for calculating the mean absolute deviation.
