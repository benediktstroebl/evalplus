Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and calculates the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list. 

The `mean_absolute_deviation` function utilizes the NumPy library to perform efficient numerical operations on the input list. It first converts the input list into a NumPy array, then calculates the mean of the array. Subsequently, it subtracts the mean from each number in the array and calculates the absolute values of these differences, resulting in the mean absolute deviation of the input list.

This solution achieves the correct calculation of the Mean Absolute Deviation, returning the desired value.
