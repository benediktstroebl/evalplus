Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and calculates the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list. 

The `mean_absolute_deviation` function leverages the `numpy` library to compute the mean absolute deviation effectively. It first converts the input list of numbers into a NumPy array, followed by calculating the mean of the array. Subsequently, it computes the absolute differences between each element and the calculated mean, ultimately returning the mean of these absolute differences as the Mean Absolute Deviation. 

The script returns the MAE value based on the absolute differences between the list elements and the mean, providing a quick assessment of the data's variability from the average.
