Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script uses the `numpy` library to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers. The `mean_absolute_deviation` function takes a list of floats as input and returns the MAD value. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:
1. Importing NumPy: The code starts by importing the NumPy library, which is a powerful library for numerical operations in Python.
2. Defining the `mean_absolute_deviation` function: This function takes a list of numbers (`numbers`) as input. It converts the input list to a NumPy array, which allows for efficient mathematical operations. Then, it calculates the mean of the absolute deviations from the mean for each number in the array. The result is the Mean Absolute Deviation for the input list of numbers.
3. Using NumPy for Efficient Computation: NumPy's array operations allow for more efficient computation compared to using traditional Python lists. The code benefits from NumPy's optimized mathematical functions, especially for large datasets.
4. Mathematical Definition of MAD: NumPy's `abs()` function calculates the absolute value of the difference between each element in the array and the mean. NumPy's `mean()` function then calculates the average of these absolute differences, which provides the MAD value.

Overall, this script provides an efficient and accurate way to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation of a list of numbers using NumPy's capabilities. Note that it assumes the input contains valid numerical values and raises no exceptions for invalid data types or other potential issues. 

It is crucial to ensure robust input validation and handling of edge cases in production environments.
