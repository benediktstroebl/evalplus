Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
The function `mean_absolute_deviation` calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It utilizes the `numpy` library to operate on the input list and calculate the deviation. The markdown description, function-heading, and test case are unchanged. 
This solution employs the `numpy` library, which offers optimized algorithms for numerical operations, enhancing performance and efficiency compared to pure Python implementations.

Here's the corresponding markdown text:
```
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
MAD = average | x - x_mean |
>>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
1.0
```
