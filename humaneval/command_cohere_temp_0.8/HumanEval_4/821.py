Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you've described, along with a separate test case to demonstrate its usage:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))

# Separate test case
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
expected_result = 1.0

result = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)

assert result == expected_result
```

This script uses the `numpy` library to provide a more efficient solution. It converts the input list of numbers to a `numpy` array, calculates the mean of this array, and then computes the absolute deviation from the mean for each number, finally returning the mean of these absolute deviations.

The test case checks if the function correctly calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation for the provided sample list of numbers. 

Feel free to adapt this solution or incorporate it into your broader project, and let me know if you would like to further discuss any part of it!
