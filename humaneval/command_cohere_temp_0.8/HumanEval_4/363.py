Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of calculating the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    devations = [abs(num - mean) for num in numbers]
    return math.fsum(devations) / len(numbers)
```
This script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation()` that takes in a list of floating numbers and returns the mean absolute deviation of the list. 

The function first calculates the mean of the numbers and then calculates the absolute deviation from the mean for each number in the list, and sums up the absolute deviations, dividing it by the total number of elements to obtain the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD). 

This approach ensures that the function works for any list of numbers and provides a single, accurate calculation of the Mean Absolute Deviation, which is a robust measure of the dispersion or variation of the dataset close to the mean, mitigating the influence of outliers. 

Note that the math module is used to calculate the sum of floating numbers incrementally, avoiding the precision loss of the built-in `sum()` function. This slight optimization improves the accuracy of the calculation for large datasets. 

This script can be imported and used anywhere in a project to calculate the MAD of a list of numbers, facilitating the accessibility and reusability of this function and enabling proper assessment of the spread or variability of datasets with a robust measure of dispersion.
