Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and calculates the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list. 

The `mean_absolute_deviation` function leverages the `numpy` library to compute the mean absolute deviation in an efficient manner. To do this, it follows the following steps:
1. Utilizes np.array() to convert the input list of numbers into a NumPy array, which allows for optimized mathematical operations.
2. Calculates the mean of the NumPy array with np.mean().
3. Finds the absolute differences between each element of the NumPy array and the mean of the array using np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))).
4. Computes the mean of the absolute differences using np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))).

This approach ensures that the code provides an accurate and efficient computation of the mean absolute deviation.

Please note that this code requires the numpy library to run. To install numpy, you can run `pip install numpy`.
