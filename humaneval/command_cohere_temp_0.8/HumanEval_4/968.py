Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script solves the problem of calculating the mean absolute deviation for a list of numbers using the `numpy` library. Here's a brief explanation of each part of the script:
1. Importing Essential Libraries:
   - It imports `numpy` for numerical operations and `math` for basic mathematical functions.
2. Function Definition:
   - `def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:`
   - This line defines a function named `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes a list of floating-point numbers (`List[float])` as input and returns a single float value, which is the Mean Absolute Deviation.
3. Calculating Mean and Absolute Deviation:
   - `return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))`
   - Inside the function, it uses `numpy` to achieve efficiency and precision.
   - `np.array(numbers)` converts the input list to a NumPy array, which allows advanced mathematical operations.
   - `np.mean(np.array(numbers))` calculates the mean (average) of the NumPy array.
   - `np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers)))` calculates the absolute difference between each element of the array and the mean.
   - Applying `np.mean()` to the result calculates the average of these absolute differences, which gives the Mean Absolute Deviation.

This approach leverages `numpy` to compute the Mean Absolute Deviation effectively and accurately. Meanwhile, the imported `math` library provides basic mathematical functions, and `typing` ensures type correctness for the function's input parameter.
