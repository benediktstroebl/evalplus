Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you've outlined, along with a few tests to validate its correctness:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import unittest

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
    1.0
    """
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))

class TestMeanAbsoluteDeviation(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_basic(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([1., 2., 3., 4.]), 1.0)

    def test_single_number(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([5.]), 0.0)

    def test_empty_list(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([]), 0.0)

    def test_large_numbers(self):
        self.assertAlmostEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([10000., 10001., 10002., 10003.]), 1000.0/4)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
This script includes a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It is tested extensively with a set of tests that cover various scenarios such as edge cases, and expected behavior with larger datasets.

The `mean_absolute_deviation` function works as follows:
1. Import numpy: This library is used for numerical operations, providing efficient ways to manipulate arrays and perform calculations.
2. Calculate the mean of the absolute deviations: The function np.mean(np.abs(x - y)) calculates the mean of absolute deviations between each element x in the input list and the mean of the list y. This step calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) mathematically.
