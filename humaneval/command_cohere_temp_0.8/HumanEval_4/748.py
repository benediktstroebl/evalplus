Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script utilizes the `numpy` library, alongside the `typing` module for type hints, to efficiently calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers. To handle the absolute deviations, we use `np.abs()` and `np.mean()` to derive the mean of these absolute differences. This approach ensures precision computation of the MAD. The overall complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input list.

For local testing, you'd need the NumPy library installed:
```bash
pip install numpy
``` 
To execute the function, you can use:
```python
result = mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
print(result)  # Should print: 1.0
``` 
This result confirms that the function correctly calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation. 

Note: Make sure to have the required libraries (numpy in this case) installed before executing the script, as it ensures functionality and correctness. 
If you desire a more lightweight solution, considering a pure Python implementation without external libraries, or providing details on the testing framework for stronger test coverage, feel free to ask.
