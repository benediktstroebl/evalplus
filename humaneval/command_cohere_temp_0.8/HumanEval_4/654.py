Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script solves the problem of calculating the mean absolute deviation for a list of numbers using the `numpy` library. It defines a function with a type hint for a list of float values. The function calculates the mean of the absolute deviations from the mean for each number in the input list using `numpy` functions, including `abs`, `array`, and `mean`. The result is the mean absolute deviation, which represents a robust measure of dispersion or variability in the dataset, incorporating both magnitude and direction of deviations.

To employ this code, ensure the `numpy` library is installed:
```
pip install numpy
``` 
This way, the Python environment will be equipped to execute the code without any setbacks.
