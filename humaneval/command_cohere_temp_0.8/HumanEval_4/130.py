Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script utilizes the `numpy` library, which provides a multitude of numerical algorithms and capabilities. It handles the absolute deviations and mean calculation through vectorized operations, ensuring efficiency and simplicity.

To harness the power of `numpy`, you'll need to install it with the following command:
```
pip install numpy
```
This installation will add the numpy library to your Python environment, allowing you to run the provided code without any obstructions.
