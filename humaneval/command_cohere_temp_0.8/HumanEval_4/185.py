Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script utilizes the `numpy` library, specifically its array creation and element manipulation functions, to efficiently calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers. The `mean_absolute_deviation` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the MAD value. To better understand, here's an example of how the code works:
- Importing NumPy: The `numpy` module is imported to leverage its statistical and array operations for efficient computation. 
 ```python
import numpy as np
```
- Defining the Function: `mean_absolute_deviation` is the function that takes a list of numbers as input (`List[float])` and returns the mean absolute deviation as a float. 
 ```python
def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
- Example Execution: The function is then exemplified with a list of numbers, showcasing its utilization and calculation.
 ```python
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
result = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: 1.0
```

By calculating the mean absolute deviation, the code provides a robust measure of variability for the input list of numbers, making it a valuable tool in data analysis and understanding the spread of data points. 
Note: The code utilizes the `numpy` library, which is not by default included in Python installations. In order to use this code, you need to make sure that you have `numpy` installed. Usually, the library can be installed by running `!pip install numpy` in your terminal. If you require assistance in ensuring the library is installed, don't hesitate to ask.
