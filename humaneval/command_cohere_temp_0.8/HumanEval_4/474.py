Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of calculating the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```

The function `mean_absolute_deviation` calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It utilizes the NumPy library to perform vectorized operations on the input list, computing the absolute differences between each element and the mean of the list, and then returning the average of these absolute differences as the mean absolute deviation.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```python
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
result = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: 1.0
```

This will print the mean absolute deviation of the list `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]`, which is 1.0. 

This approach leverages NumPy to compute the mean absolute deviation in a more efficient way, making it a reliable solution for this problem.  If you would like, I can provide additional examples or explanations to assist with understanding or provide further context as needed. Let me know and I'll be glad to adjust accordingly.
