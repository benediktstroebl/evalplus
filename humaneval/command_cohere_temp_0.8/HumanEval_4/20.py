Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script uses the `numpy` library to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers. The `mean_absolute_deviation` function takes a list of floats `numbers` as input and returns the MAD value. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:
- Import the `List` module from the `typing` module to ensure type safety.
- Import the `numpy` module, a powerful library for numerical operations.
- Define the `mean_absolute_deviation` function that takes a list of numbers and calculates the MAD, which is the average absolute deviation of the numbers from their mean.
- Convert the input list to a NumPy array with `np.array(numbers)`, which allows for faster and more efficient numerical operations.
- Calculate the mean of the NumPy array with `np.mean(np.array(numbers))`, assuming the list is already sorted.
- Calculate the absolute deviation of each element from the mean with `np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers)))`.
- Return the average of these absolute deviations using `np.mean()`.
