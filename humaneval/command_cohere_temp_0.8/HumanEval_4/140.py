Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of calculating the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))

# Tests
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
expected_mean_deviation = math.fsum([math.fabs(x - (math.fsum(numbers) / len(numbers))) for x in numbers]) / len(numbers)
print(f"Test: {mean_absolute_deviation(numbers) == expected_mean_deviation}")
```
This script uses the `numpy` library to provide a more efficient solution. It takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the list, following the formula: "Mean Absolute Deviation = Î£(|x - x_mean|)/n". 

The code includes a unit test to verify the correctness of the function, expecting the result to be close to the expected value.
