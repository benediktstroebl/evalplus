Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of calculating the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return math.fsum(list(map(lambda x: abs(x - statistics.mean(numbers)), numbers))) / len(numbers)
```
This script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation()` that takes in a list of floating numbers and returns the mean absolute deviation of the list. 

The function employs the `math.fsum()` function to calculate the sum of absolute values of the deviations, and the `statistics.mean()` function to obtain the mean of the dataset, subsequently formulating the mean absolute deviation. 

To confirm the functionality of the script, a unittest is incorporated.

```python
import unittest

class TestMeanAbsoluteDeviation(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_mean_absolute_deviation(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([1., 2., 3., 4.]), 1.)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
In the test case `test_mean_absolute_deviation`, the function is applied to a list of numbers, and the result is compared to the expected value of 1.0 using the `self.assertEqual()` method. 

The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block guarantees that the test case is executed only when the script is run directly.
