Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and calculates the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list. 

The `mean_absolute_deviation` function employs the `numpy` library to compute the mean of absolute differences between each list element and the mean of the list. This results in greater efficiency and enhanced numerical readability. The outcome is then returned as the mean absolute deviation.

This approach provides a more efficient and concise solution, which is easier to test and debug. Python lists and NumPy arrays are compatible, so there is no necessity to convert the list into an array explicitly.
