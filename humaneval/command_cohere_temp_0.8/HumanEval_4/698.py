Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of calculating the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import unittest

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))

class TestMeanAbsoluteDeviation(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_mean_absolute_deviation_single_number(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0]), 0)

    def test_mean_absolute_deviation_two_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0]), 1.0)

    def test_mean_absolute_deviation_three_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]), 1.0)

    def test_mean_absolute_deviation_four_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]), 1.0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This script utilizes the `numpy` library, which provides robust support for numerical operations in Python. The `mean_absolute_deviation` function accepts a list of numbers and returns the mean absolute deviation, which indicates the average absolute difference between each element and the mean of the dataset. 

The `TestMeanAbsoluteDeviation` class embraces four distinct test methods, each of which verifies the function's correctness against specific input scenarios. 

To execute the test suite, run the script with the `unittest` runner, which sequentially executes each test method and reports any discrepancies against the expected behavior, as asserted in the `self.assertEqual` statements. 

This approach enables the integration of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function into larger datasets or analysis tools, ready to compute metrics based on absolute deviations from the mean.
