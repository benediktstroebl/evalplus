Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you've outlined, along with a separate test module to validate its correctness:
```python
# module code
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    :param numbers: List of input numbers
    :return: Mean Absolute Deviation
    """
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    dev = sum(abs(x - mean) for x in numbers) / len(numbers)
    return dev
```

```python
# module tests
import unittest
from code_example import mean_absolute_deviation

class TestMeanAbsoluteDeviation(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_mean_absolute_deviation(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([1., 2., 3., 4.]), 1.0)
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([0., 0., 0.]), 0.0)
        self.assertAlmostEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([-1., -2., -3., -4.]) , 2.8284271247461903) 

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

The `mean_absolute_deviation` function is adapted from your provided function, along with corresponding unit tests to validate its behavior. 

The `TestMeanAbsoluteDeviation` class derives from `unittest.TestCase`, facilitating the creation of test methods that initiate assertions using the `self.assert*` methods. 

The `test_mean_absolute_deviation` method invokes the `mean_absolute_deviation` function with three distinct lists of numbers and ascertains the resultant MAD values with the expected values.

Executing this script delivers a clear success message, indicating all tests passed, or a failure message with specifics on the encountered issue, aiding in the validation of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function's correctness.  This approach fosters resilient coding practices and facilitates effortless debugging, if necessary.
