Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It utilizes the NumPy library to perform efficient numerical operations on the input list, computing the absolute differences between each element and the mean of the list, and then returning the average of these absolute deviations as the mean absolute deviation. 
The result is a robust measure of the variability of the dataset, accommodating both positive and negative deviations from the mean, thus providing a clearer view of the data's dispersion compared to standard deviation in skewed distributions.
