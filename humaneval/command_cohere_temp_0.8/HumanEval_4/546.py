Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It uses the NumPy library to perform vectorized operations on the input list, computing the absolute differences between each element and the mean of the list, and then returning the mean of these absolute differences. This approach is more efficient than performing the calculations manually, especially for large datasets.
