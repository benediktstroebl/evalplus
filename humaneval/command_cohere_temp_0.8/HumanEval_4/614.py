Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script provides a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers. The function utilizes the NumPy library to efficiently handle array operations. It first converts the input list of numbers to a NumPy array, computes the mean of the array, and then calculates the absolute deviation of each element from the mean, again using NumPy's `abs` function and `np.mean` function to find the overall mean of these absolute deviations. This formulation ensures accurate and efficient computation of MAD, making it a reliable solution for such statistical analysis.
