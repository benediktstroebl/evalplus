Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you've outlined, along with a markdown code block showing the code and corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import unittest

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))

class TestMeanAbsoluteDeviation(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_basic(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([1., 2., 3., 4.]), 1.0)
    def test_single_number(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([10.0]), 0.0)
    def test_empty_list(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([]), 0.0)
    def test_large_numbers(self):
        self.assertAlmostEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([10000., 10000., 10000., 10000.]), 1000.0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
The provided Python script solves the problem of calculating the mean absolute deviation for a list of numbers. The `mean_absolute_deviation` function takes a list of floats as input and returns the mean absolute deviation, which is the average absolute difference between each element and the mean of the list. 

The solution uses NumPy to compute the mean and absolute deviations efficiently. It then compares the result against expected values in a variety of scenarios:
- `test_basic`: Checks that the function correctly calculates the mean absolute deviation for a list of integers.
- `test_single_number`: Confirm that the function handles a list with a single number correctly.
- `test_empty_list`: Tests the function when the input list is empty.
- `test_large_numbers`: Evaluates the function with a list of large integers to ensure accurate results.

Additionally, the `unittest.main()` call enables the running of the tests when the script is executed directly.

This code demonstrates how to solve the problem programmatically and includes tests to ensure the correctness of the solution, adhering to best practices.
