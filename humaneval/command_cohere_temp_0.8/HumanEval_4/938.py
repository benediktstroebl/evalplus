Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of calculating the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    :param numbers: List of input numbers
    :return: Mean Absolute Deviation
    """
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```

This script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and returns the mean absolute deviation of the list.

The function first uses NumPy to convert the input list of numbers into a NumPy array, this allows us to use NumPy's built-in functions to calculate the mean and absolute deviations efficiently. 

Next, the function uses the `np.mean()` function to calculate the mean of the NumPy array. The mean is the average of the numbers in the list. 

Then, the code uses `np.abs()` to calculate the absolute difference between each element of the array and the mean. 

Finally, the function uses the `np.mean()` function again to calculate the mean of the absolute differences, which is the mean absolute deviation of the list of numbers. 

This approach provides a more efficient solution compared to calculating the absolute differences manually in a loop, especially for large datasets.
