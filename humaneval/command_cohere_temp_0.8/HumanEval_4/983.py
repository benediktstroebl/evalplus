Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    :param numbers: List of input numbers
    :return: Mean Absolute Deviation value
    """
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. 
It employs the numpy library to operate on arrays and quickly compute the mean and absolute deviations. Finally, it returns the mean absolute deviation value, which is regarded as an accurate measure of dispersion or variability in the given dataset.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```python
print(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]))
```
This will output:
```bash
1.0
```
