Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list.

The function first converts the list of numbers into a numpy array. Then, it calculates the mean of the array and subtracts it from each number in the array to get the deviation from the mean for each number. Finally, it takes the absolute value of each deviation and calculates the mean to return as the final answer.

This approach utilizes numpy's efficient array operations, making the calculation quicker and more concise than a pure Python approach, especially for larger datasets.

Although the function is designed to handle any list of numbers, it may be particularly useful for numerical datasets where you need to quickly assess the variability of the data from its mean. 

To test this function, you can call it with a list of numbers and compare the output to the desired result:
```python
print(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]))  # Should print 1.0
``` 
This would confirm that the function operates correctly.
