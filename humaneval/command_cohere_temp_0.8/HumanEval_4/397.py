Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you've outlined, along with a Markdown code block showing the code and a few tests to validate its functionality:
```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    """
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Input list is empty")
    
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    devations = [abs(num - mean) for num in numbers]
    return sum(devations) / len(numbers)

# Tests:
def test_mad_example():
    """ Example test: Check the calculation of MAD for a list of integers.
    """
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    mad = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)
    assert mad == 1  # Expected result is 1.0 due to mean of [1, 2, 3, 4] = 2.0

def test_empty_list():
    """ Test case for an empty list input.
    Should raise a ValueError.
    """
    numbers = []
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)

def test_single_value():
    """ Test case for a single value.
    Should raise a ValueError.
    """
    numbers = [5]
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_mad_example()
    test_empty_list()
    test_single_value()
```
The `mean_absolute_deviation` function is encapsulated within this code, along with three distinct tests to verify its effectiveness in a variety of circumstances. The first test verifies the example problem provided in the original description and ensures that the mean absolute deviation for a list of integers is correct. The second test checks how the function reacts to an empty list, while the third test checks how the function reacts to a list with a single element, both of which should raise `ValueError` as indicated in the script.

The `pytest.raises` decorator is used in the test cases to ensure that the `ValueError` is raised only when the function is provided with an empty list or a list with a single element.  This helps us ensure that the function behaves as expected.  If the `mean_absolute_deviation` function had its docstring updated, the understanding of its parameters and returns would be clearer to readers.  If you want further tests to validate the function, let me know and I'll be glad to assist.  This dataset can serve as a foundation for generating more tests to cover edge cases and specific scenarios.  Please let me know if you need any further help.
