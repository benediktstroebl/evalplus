Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you've outlined, along with a markdown code block showing the code and a sample test:
```python
# Ensure tests are run in a deterministic order
import random
random.seed(0)

import numpy as np
import pytest

from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(numbers - np.mean(numbers)))

# Test dataset
@pytest.mark.parametrize('test_input, expected', [
    ([1., 2., 3., 4.], 1.0),
    ([-1., -2., -3., -4.], 2.0),
    ([0.1, -0.2, 0.3, -0.4, 500.0, -500.0], 298.6)
])
def test_mad(test_input, expected):
    result = mean_absolute_deviation(test_input)
    assert abs(result - expected) < 1e-6

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_mad([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], 1.0)
```
This code snippet includes a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers, using the `numpy` library for numerical operations. 

Then it includes a unittest that verifies the functionality of the function on multiple test cases.

Run the script to test the function. The assert statement will throw a console error if the test fails, making sure that the absolute difference between the result and the expected value is smaller than 1e-6, which accounts for possible floating-point error. 

To improve test coverage, you can add more test cases to the `test_mad` function to validate various scenarios.  This will help us to ensure that the function can handle any valid input gracefully.
