Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    :param numbers: List of input numbers
    :return: Mean Absolute Deviation value
    """
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    mad = sum(math.fabs(x - mean) for x in numbers) / len(numbers)
    return mad
```

This script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and calculates the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list. 

The Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) is calculated by finding the absolute difference between each number in the list and the mean of the list, and then taking the average of those differences. 

The function returns the calculated MAD.

The math.fabs() function is used to get the absolute value of the difference between the number and the mean.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```python
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
result = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)
print(result)
```

This will print out the mean absolute deviation of the list, which is 1.0. 

If you intend to evaluate the code using a specific dataset, feel free to replace the testList variable with your dataset. 

This will ensure the code is executed with the desired dataset. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to troubleshoot any latent points!
