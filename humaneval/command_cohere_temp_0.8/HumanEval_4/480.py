Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script uses the `numpy` library to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers. The `mean_absolute_deviation` function takes a list of floats as input and returns the MAD value. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:
- Importing numpy — The first line imports the numpy library, which is a powerful library for numerical operations in Python.
- List comprehension for numbers - The numbers list comprehension transforms the input list of numbers into a numpy array, which is then used for further calculations.
- Calculation of mean — The middle line with np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers)))) calculates the mean of the absolute deviations from the mean for each number in the array. The code essentially finds the average absolute deviation from the mean, which is the definition of Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD).

This code benefits from the numerical operations optimization in `numpy`, which enhances performance and maintains accuracy. The result is a straightforward solution for calculating MAD in Python, leveraging the capabilities of the `numpy` library. 
This approach provides a concise solution to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers, benefiting from numpy's efficient numerical operations.

This approach allows you to accurately calculate MAD in a efficient manner. You can use this function in other parts of your code to calculate the MAD of any list of numbers. You can also modify the function to handle a stream of numbers or deal with large datasets efficiently.
