Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script uses the numpy library to calculate the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. 

The function `mean_absolute_deviation` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the list. The function utilizes numpy's `abs` function to calculate the absolute value of the difference between each element and the mean of the list. The `mean` function then calculates the mean of these absolute differences.

The numpy array function is used to convert the list of numbers into a numpy array, which allows for more efficient calculations. The mean of the numpy array is then calculated using the `mean` function.

The result is the mean absolute deviation of the list of numbers, which is the average absolute difference between each element and the mean of the list. 

This algorithm is particularly useful when dealing with datasets containing outliers since it provides a measure of the variability of the dataset points around the mean, without regard to the direction of the difference.
