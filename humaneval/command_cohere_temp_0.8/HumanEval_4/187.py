Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script utilizes the numpy library, making the calculation more efficient and leading to a simpler code structure. The function `mean_absolute_deviation` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers from their mean. 

Here's an example of using this function:
```python
>>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
1.0
```
This produces the expected outcome of 1.0, confirming the correct operation of the algorithm.
