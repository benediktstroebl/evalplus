Here's a Python script that includes a function to calculate the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import pytest

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))

# Example usage
print(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]))
```

This script defines the `mean_absolute_deviation` function that takes a list of numbers and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list. It utilizes the `numpy` library to calculate the mean and absolute deviations efficiently.

To validate the functionality, the `pytest` framework is included. It comes with a simple test case (`test_mean_absolute_deviation`) that ensures the function behaves as expected. The `pytest` framework automatically runs this test when executing this script. 

You can execute this script to calculate the mean absolute deviation of the provided list (`[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]`) and print the result, which should be `1.0`. Adjust the test list accordingly to match your desired input.  If you want to calculate the MAD for different lists, you can call the function multiple times within a loop, or you can integrate parameterized testing frameworks like `pytest` provides `parametrize` which allows you to write a single test function that gets run with different arguments.  Here is an example of how to integrate it with `parametrize`. 
```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize('numbers, expected', [
    ([1, 2, 3, 4], 1.0),
    ([10, 20, 30, 40], 10.0)
])
def test_mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float], expected: float):
    actual = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)
    assert actual == expected
``` 
This way, with `parametrize`, you can test the function against multiple inputs and ensure it performs correctly each time.  This approach keeps your test suite more concise, clear, and maintainable, especially when dealing with multiple inputs and ensuring they all behave as expected.  If you don't have a specific list of examples you want to test, you can write a random test data generator for `pytest` that generates random lists of numbers and then test the function with those, this way you get wide coverage of inputs testing.
