Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    :param numbers: List of input numbers
    :return: Mean Absolute Deviation
    """
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and calculates the mean absolute deviation of the list. 

The Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) is a measure of the variability of a dataset. It is calculated by taking the absolute difference between each data point in the dataset and the mean of the dataset, and then taking the average of these differences. 

The script utilizes the `numpy` library to make computations easier and to handle arrays, first subtracting the mean of the numbers from each number in the list, and then taking the absolute value of these differences, and finally, averaging these absolute differences to return the MAD. 

This solution is efficient and easily integrates into larger projects. Let me know if any additional cases need to be handled!
