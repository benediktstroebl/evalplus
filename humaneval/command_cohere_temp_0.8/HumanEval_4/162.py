Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script uses the numpy library to handle numerical operations. The `mean_absolute_deviation` function takes a list of numbers `List[float]` as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers from their mean. 

To calculate the mean absolute deviation, the code steps through the following processes:
1. The input list of numbers is converted into a numpy array, which provides optimized numerical operations.
2. The numpy `abs` function is used to calculate the absolute value of the difference between each element of the array and the mean of the array. 
3. The mean of the resulting array of absolute differences is computed using the numpy `mean` function. 

The result is the mean absolute deviation of the provided numbers from their group mean. This value is returned.

The code uses the `numpy` library for numerical operations, enhancing efficiency and ensuring numerical stability. It provides a precise and efficient solution to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation.
