Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script utilizes the `numpy` library, alternatively known as `numpy`, to handle numerical operations within the `mean_absolute_deviation` function. The function effectively calculates the absolute deviations between each number and the mean, subsequently using `numpy.mean` to determine the average deviation. While the initial explanation indicated the usage of a simple `math` module, it has been substituted with `numpy` to handle the numerical aspects efficiently. 
This approach improves the function's reliability and performance when handling datasets with varying sizes, ensuring it can handle larger lists of numbers without sacrificing accuracy or efficiency.
