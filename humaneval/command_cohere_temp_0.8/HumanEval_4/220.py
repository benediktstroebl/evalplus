Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you've described, along with a separate test module to validate its correctness:
```python
# module code
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
    1.0
    """
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))

# test code
# use pytest to test the function
import pytest

@pytest.mark.unit
def test_mad():
    # Test Case 1: Basic test case with simple data
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    expected = 1
    result = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)
    assert result == expected

    # Test Case 2: Test case with single number
    numbers = [10]
    expected = 0
    result = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)
    assert result == expected

    # Test Case 3: Test case with all equal values
    numbers = [10, 10, 10, 10]
    expected = 0
    result = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)
    assert result == expected

    # Test Case 4: Test case with negative numbers
    numbers = [-1, -2, -3, -4]
    expected = 3
    result = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)
    assert result == expected
```

In this script, we calculate the mean absolute deviation using `numpy`, which provides efficient vectorized operations on arrays. The test module uses the `pytest` framework to verify the function's correctness across different scenarios.
