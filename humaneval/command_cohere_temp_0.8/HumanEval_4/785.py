Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list.

The function then uses NumPy to compute the mean of the absolute deviations. 

Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) measures the average absolute deviation of a dataset from its mean, providing a measure of the variability of the dataset. 

This implementation of MAD uses NumPy to provide a more efficient computation, especially for large datasets, while also delivering accurate results. 

You can use this function in your Python code to calculate the mean absolute deviation of any list of numbers. 

Note: Remember to install NumPy successfully in your virtual environment, if not already installed, using: 
```
pip install numpy
``` 
This allows you to use the NumPy library without any conflicts in your project.
