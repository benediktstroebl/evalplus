Here's a Python script that includes a function to calculate the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    """
    if len(numbers) < 1:
        return "Please provide a list of numbers to calculate MAD."
    
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    mad = sum(abs(x - mean) for x in numbers) / len(numbers)
    
    return mad

# Unit tests for the function
def test_mean_absolute_deviation():
    assert mean_absolute_deviation([1, 2, 3, 4]) == 1
    assert mean_absolute_deviation([2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 6]) == 0.5
    assert mean_absolute_deviation([-1, 1, -5, 5, 10, 0]) == 3
    assert mean_absolute_deviation([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) == 0

if __name__ == "__main__" :
    test_mean_absolute_deviation()
```
The function `mean_absolute_deviation` calculates the mean of the list of numbers provided, then determines the absolute deviation of each number from the mean, and finally, averages those absolute deviations to provide the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD).

The unit test section includes three assertions to test the function with different input lists. You can use these tests to verify the functionality of the function. 

Run the script to execute the tests and verify that they pass without errors.  This will ensure that the function `mean_absolute_deviation` operates correctly.  If everything is fine, the console should display:
```bash
<!DOCTYPE doctype=”text/html”>

<h1>Test Result</h1>
