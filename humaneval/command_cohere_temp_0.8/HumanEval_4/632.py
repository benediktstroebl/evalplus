Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list.

The function first converts the list of numbers into a numpy array. Then, it calculates the mean of the array and subtracts it from each number in the array to get the deviation. Finally, it takes the absolute value of each deviation and calculates the mean to return the final result. 

This approach utilizes numpy's efficient pooling of operations to do the computations faster and in a more readable manner.
