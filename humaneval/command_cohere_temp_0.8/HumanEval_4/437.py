Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation of a list of numbers. It utilizes the numpy library to operate on the input list and calculate the absolute deviations from the mean, and then computes the average of these deviations to provide the Mean Absolute Deviation value. This approach ensures accurate and efficient computation. 
The function is self-contained and does not rely on any external variables or assumptions. However, it's worth noting that the numpy dependency will result in an error if not installed locally, necessitating the need for a setup script. Hints:
1. **NumPy Utilization**: NumPy arrays enable operations on lists of numbers efficiently.
2. **Mean Calculation**: Subtracting the mean from each number and taking absolute values is faster with NumPy.
3. **Python Execution**: This solution is 100% Python-based, relying solely on standard Python and NumPy libraries.
4. **Efficiency**: NumPy's array operations are optimized for speed compared to traditional Python lists.
```
This approach showcases a concise implementation of the MAD calculation using NumPy for its touted speed advantage. 
If you encounter any issues installing numpy, you can rely on pip from Python's standard library to install it:
''''''''
pip install numpy
''''''''
