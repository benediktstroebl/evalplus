Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you've described, along with a few tests to validate its correctness:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import pytest

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    """
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))

# Test cases
def test_mad_single_number():
    """ Test case for a single input number """
    result = mean_absolute_deviation([1.0])
    assert result == 0.0

def test_mad_small_dataset():
    """ Test case for a small dataset """
    result = mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
    assert result == 1.0

def test_mad_large_dataset():
    """ Test case for a large dataset """
    numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0]
    result = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)
    assert result == 1.0  

def test_mad_negative_values():
    """ Test case where input list contains negative values """
    numbers = [1.0, -2.0, 3.0, -4.0, 5.0]
    result = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)
    assert result == 2.0 
```

In this script, we use the `numpy` library to handle numerical operations, which provides a more efficient and accurate calculation. The `test_mad_negative_values` test case is added to ensure the function can handle negative values correctly, and the other test cases validate the functionality for different scenarios. 

You can add these tests to your codebase to verify the correctness of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function and ensure it behaves as expected with different input types. 
If you are using `pytest`, you can execute this test suite by adding the following command to your terminal:
```bash
pytest
```
