Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and calculates the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list. 

The `mean_absolute_deviation` function leverages the NumPy library to process the list of numbers. It first converts the input list to a NumPy array, followed by computation of the mean of the array. Subsequently, it computes the absolute deviation between each element and the mean, and ultimately returns the mean of these absolute deviations as the output. 

This solution has a time complexity of `O(n)` since it requires iterating over the list of numbers once for computation and once for the mean operation, making it an efficient solution for large datasets.
