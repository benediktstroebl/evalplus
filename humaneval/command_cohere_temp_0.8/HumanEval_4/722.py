Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and calculates the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list. 

The `mean_absolute_deviation` function leverages the NumPy library to process the list of numbers. It first converts the input list to a NumPy array and calculates the mean of the array. Then, it subtracts the mean from each number in the array and calculates the absolute values of these differences, yielding an array of absolute deviations. Finally, it calculates the mean of these absolute deviations using NumPy's mean function, resulting in the mean absolute deviation of the input list.

This solution allows you to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation in a straightforward manner, making it a convenient and efficient approach for this problem. You can import this function into your code to utilize it as needed, ensuring ease of use and accessibility.
