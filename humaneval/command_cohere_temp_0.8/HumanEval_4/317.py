Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation of a list of numbers. It utilizes the numpy library to operate on the input list and calculate the absolute deviations from the mean, and then finds the average of these absolute deviations to provide the Mean Absolute Deviation value, which is a robust measure of dataset dispersion. 
This problem can also be solved using the built-in `statistics` module:
```python
from typing import List
import statistics

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return statistics.mean_absolute_difference(numbers)
```
