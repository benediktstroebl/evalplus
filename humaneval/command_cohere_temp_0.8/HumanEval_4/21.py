Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script utilizes the numpy library, which enables operations on arrays and performs calculations efficiently. The math module is imported to provide access to fundamental mathematical functions, although it's not explicitly used in this case.

Note that this implementation assumes that the list of numbers is already sorted. If the list is not sorted, the result may not be accurate. 

To address potential sorting concerns, you might consider preprocessing the input list as follows:
```python
def sorted_mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    return mean_absolute_deviation(sorted_numbers)
```
This adjustment ensures that the input list is properly sorted before performing the Mean Absolute Deviation calculation.
