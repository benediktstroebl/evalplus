Here's a Python script that includes a function to calculate the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))

def test_mad():
    assert mean_absolute_deviation([1, 2, 3, 4]) == 1.0
    assert mean_absolute_deviation([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == 1.0
    assert mean_absolute_deviation([-1, 2, 3, 4, -5, 6, -7, 8, 9, -10]) == 3.0

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_mad()
```
This script uses the `numpy` library to provide an efficient implementation of calculating the mean absolute deviation, which is a measure of the variability of a dataset. It also includes a `test_mad` function to verify the correctness of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function with the test cases provided earlier.
