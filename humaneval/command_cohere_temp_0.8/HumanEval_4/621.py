Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script provides a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It utilizes the NumPy library to operate on arrays and performs the necessary calculations efficiently. The mean absolute deviation is a measure of the variability of the dataset being resistant to outliers, and this function enables you to easily compute it for any list of numbers. 
The logic employed by the function is outlined as follows:
1. The function takes a list of numbers as input.
2. It converts this list to a NumPy array for efficient numerical operations.
3. Subsequently, it computes the mean of the array, grasping the central tendency of the dataset.
4. Absolute deviations from the mean are calculated for each element using NumPy's absolute value function.
5. Lastly, the mean of these absolute deviations is taken, culminating in the mean absolute deviation value, which is then returned. In a nutshell, the function unleashes the power of NumPy to provide a robust and uncomplicated approach to calculating mean absolute deviation.
