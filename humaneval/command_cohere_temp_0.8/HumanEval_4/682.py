Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation of a list of numbers. It utilizes the NumPy library to operate on arrays and perform calculations efficiently. The MAD is calculated by subtracting the mean of the array from each number, taking the absolute values, and then computing the mean of those absolute differences. The result is the Mean Absolute Deviation, which provides a measure of the dispersion of the dataset around its mean, valuing robustness to outliers over sensitivity to deviations from the mean.
