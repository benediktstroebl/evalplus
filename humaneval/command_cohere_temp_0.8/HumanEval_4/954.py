Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
The function `mean_absolute_deviation` calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It utilizes the `numpy` library to operate on the input list as a one-dimensional array, calculating the absolute differences between each element and the mean of the list. These differences are then averaged to provide the mean absolute deviation, which is returned as the function's result.

The implementation of `numpy` is particularly useful for efficient numerical operations, such as element-wise differences and mean calculation, improving performance and readability compared to a pure Python implementation.

To better understand the process, here's a breakdown of the steps in a markdown format:
```
1. Importing necessary modules: The script starts by importing `numpy` for numerical operations and `List` from the `typing` module to enable type hints.
2. Defining the `mean_absolute_deviation` function: The function takes a list of float numbers as input. It uses `numpy.array` to convert the input list to a NumPy array, which allows for efficient mathematical operations.
3. Calculating mean: The mean of the array is computed using `numpy.mean`, which accurately calculates the average value. 
4. Calculating absolute deviations: The code uses element-wise subtraction (`numpy.array - numpy.mean(array))`) to create a new array of absolute differences between each element and the mean. 
5. Returning the mean absolute deviation: The mean of the absolute differences is calculated using `numpy.mean`, providing the Mean Absolute Deviation as the output.
``` 
Overall, the script offers a concise and efficient solution to calculate the mean absolute deviation using the `numpy` library, making it a robust implementation for this task.
