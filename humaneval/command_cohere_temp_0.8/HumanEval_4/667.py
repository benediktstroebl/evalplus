Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script utilizes the numpy library to calculate the mean and absolute deviations in a more efficient manner. The function `mean_absolute_deviation` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list.

To understand the logic behind this code, let's break it down:
- The function `mean_absolute_deviation` takes a list of numbers as its input.
- The list of numbers is turned into a NumPy array by the `np.array(numbers)` function. This allows us to leverage NumPy's efficient operations on arrays. 
- The mean of the numbers in the array is then calculated by the `np.mean(np.array(numbers))` function.
- The absolute deviations from the mean are calculated by the expression `np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers)))`. This calculates the difference between each number and the mean, and then takes the absolute value of each difference.
-  The mean of the absolute deviations is then calculated by the `np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))));` function.

The result of the function is the mean absolute deviation of the input list of numbers, providing an overall measure of the variability of the dataset with respect to the center point. 

This approach provides a more efficient solution, leveraging the benefits of the NumPy library to handle numerical operations efficiently. 

Note: Ensure that you have the `numpy` library installed to run this script, as it is a required dependency. You can install it using `pip install numpy`.
