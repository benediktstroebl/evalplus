Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script uses the `numpy` library to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers. The `mean_absolute_deviation` function takes a list of floats as input and returns the MAD value. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:
1. Importing Required Libraries:
The code starts by importing the required library, `numpy`, which is used for numerical operations.
2. Calculating Mean Absolute Deviation:
The function `mean_absolute_deviation` calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It utilizes `numpy` to perform efficient numerical operations on the input data.
3. Transforming List to Array:
The input list of numbers is converted into a `numpy` array using the `np.array` function. This allows for more efficient mathematical operations on the data.
4. Calculating Mean:
The mean of the array is calculated using the `np.mean` function. This provides the average value of the dataset.
5. Calculating Absolute Deviation:
The code then subtracts the mean from each value in the array and calculates the absolute value of each difference using `np.abs`. This results in an array of absolute deviations.
6. Calculating Mean of Absolute Deviations:
Finally, the mean of the absolute deviation array is calculated using `np.mean`. This provides the average absolute deviation from the mean, which is the Mean Absolute Deviation value for the given dataset.

The script promotes efficiency in numerical operations and delivers the Mean Absolute Deviation value based on the provided list of numbers.
