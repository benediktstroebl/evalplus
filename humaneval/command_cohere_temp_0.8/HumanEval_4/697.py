Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you've outlined, along with a markdown code block showing the solution:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```

Let's break down the code above into separate paragraphs to better explain each section:
Firstly, we import the `numpy` library and use the `List` type annotation from the `typing` module to ensure our function uses the provided list of float inputs. Instead of manually iterating through the list and calculating the deviation, we utilize `numpy` to smoothly handle the numerical operations. 

We take the provided list of numbers and convert it to a numpy array through `np.array(numbers)`. Then, we find the mean of this array through `np.mean(np.array(numbers))`, serving as the center point for our deviation calculation. Finally, we calculate the absolute difference between each element and the mean, resulting in a new numpy array. 

To get the overall mean absolute deviation, we once more rely on `numpy` and use `np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))` to find the average of these absolute differences, returning the final result. 

This approach provides a concise and efficient solution without manual iteration and offers the robustness and optimization capabilities of `numpy` for such numerical operations. 

You can test the function with various input lists of floats. Here's an example of how you can use it with a basic test case:
```python
numbers = [1., 2., 3., 4.]
result = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)
print("Mean Absolute Deviation:", result)
```

To better illustrate the function's usage within a test case, you can modify the function call with different inputs and verify the output, ensuring the function operates correctly.  This way, you can confidently validate the problem's solution with diverse datasets.
