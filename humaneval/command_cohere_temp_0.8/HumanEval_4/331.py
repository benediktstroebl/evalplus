Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you've outlined, along with a markdown code block showing the code and detailed comments about how it works:
```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers.
    
    Parameters:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of numerical data.
        
    Returns:
        float: The mean absolute deviation of the input list.
    """
    return float(sum(abs(x - sum(numbers) / len(numbers)) for x in numbers)) / len(numbers)
```

This function `mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:` takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the mean absolute deviation of the dataset, which is the average absolute difference between each element and the mean of the dataset.

The MD code block explains how the code works:
```python
# Calculate the mean of the absolute deviations from the mean for each data point
mad = sum(abs(x - mu) for x, mu in zip(numbers, enumerate())) / len(numbers)
```

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:
1. The function takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the mean of the dataset, `mu`, by dividing the sum of the numbers by the number of elements (length of the list).
2. It then calculates the absolute deviation for each number in the list by subtracting the mean and taking the absolute value.
3. The code uses a list comprehension to calculate the sum of these absolute deviations.
4. Finally, it returns the mean of these absolute deviations as the mean absolute deviation of the input list. 
5. The MD code block explains this process and provides a sample usage example. 

This code efficiently calculates the mean absolute deviation, a robust metric for measuring the variability of a dataset relative to its mean. Gaining a deeper understanding of this code requires a basic comprehension of Python, statistical concepts, and the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) function.
