Here's a Python script that includes a function to calculate the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import unittest

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))

class TestMeanAbsoluteDeviation(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_basic(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([1., 2., 3., 4.]), 1.0)
    def test_empty_list(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([]), 0.)
    def test_negative_values(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([-1., -2., -3., -4.]), 3.0)
    def test_large_values(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([10., 20., 30., 40.]), 10.0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This script includes a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` designed to calculate the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. The function utilizes the `numpy` library to perform the necessary calculations, including vectorized operations on the input list.

The code snippet includes a set of unit tests to verify the correctness of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function. The tests cover a variety of scenarios, including a basic test case, an empty list, negative values, and large values.

The `unittest` module is used to define and run the test cases. The `assertEqual` method is used to verify that the actual result of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function is equal to the expected value for each test case. If all tests pass, the script will exit successfully. If any test fails, it will display the specific test case that encountered an issue, highlighting the precise deviation between expected and actual results. 

This enables the easy identification of any problems with the `mean_absolute_deviation` function and ensures its accurate execution. 

Overall, this script demonstrates a best practice in coding by incorporating tests to validate the functionality of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function, contributing to robust code that reliably performs the requested task.  If you would like more information on the logic of this method see the [numpy documentation on mean absolute deviation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.mean.html).
