Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script utilizes the `numpy` library, incorporating it via import, to enhance the efficiency of the provided `mean_absolute_deviation` function. This function accepts a list of numbers and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), which is the average absolute difference between each element and the mean of the dataset.

To compute the MAD, the function creates a NumPy array from the input list of numbers. This allows for more optimized mathematical operations. It then calculates the mean of the array and subtracts it from each number in the array, resulting in a new array of absolute differences. Finally, it computes the mean of these absolute differences to return the MAD.

By leveraging NumPy's capabilities, this improved version executes operations on arrays with enhanced speed and efficiency, ensuring quicker and more reliable computation of the Mean Absolute Deviation for larger datasets.

This approach allows for more concise and efficient code, while still producing the same output and passing the same tests as the provided code.
