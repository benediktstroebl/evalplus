Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script utilizes the `numpy` library, taking advantage of its efficient numerical operations on arrays to calculate the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. The function `mean_absolute_deviation` accepts a list of floats, returns the calculated Mean Absolute Deviation. 

To install the required package, execute `pip install numpy`.

You can incorporate this function into your code, and it will execute swiftly, providing the Mean Absolute Deviation for the given list of numbers.
