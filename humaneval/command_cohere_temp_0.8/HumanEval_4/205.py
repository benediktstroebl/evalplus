Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list.

The function first converts the list of numbers into a numpy array. Then, it calculates the mean of the array and subtracts it from each number in the array to get the deviation from the mean for each number. Finally, it takes the absolute value of each deviation and calculates the mean to return as the final answer.

The `mean_absolute_deviation` function computes the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It is a robust measure of dispersion that is not sensitive to outliers or changes in the data distribution.

Here's an example of using the function:
```python
print(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]))
```
This would output:
1.0

Which is correct; this demonstrates the function's ability to correctly calculate the mean absolute deviation of the provided list as described in the problem statement.
