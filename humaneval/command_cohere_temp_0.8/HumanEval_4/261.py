Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and calculates the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of the numbers in the list. 

The script utilizes the numpy library to operate on the array and calculate the MAD, which is the average absolute difference between each element and the mean of the list. This implementation avoids the manual calculation of the mean and simplifies the computation of the absolute deviations, making it more efficient and less prone to errors. 

Note: Make sure to have the `numpy` library installed to be able to run this code. You can include this line in your `requirements.txt` file if you are using Vue Studios, or you can install it using `pip` by running `pip install numpy`.
