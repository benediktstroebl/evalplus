Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
The function `mean_absolute_deviation` calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers. It utilizes the NumPy library to perform the necessary computations efficiently. First, it creates a NumPy array from the input list of numbers. Then, it computes the mean of the array and subtracts it from each number in the array to get the deviations. Finally, it calculates the mean of the absolute deviations to return the MAD. 
This approach ensures accurate and rapid calculation of the Mean Absolute Deviation, making it a valuable tool for statistical analysis. 
To execute this code and run the tests, you must install the NumPy library. 

This script employs the NumPy array functions to compute the mean and absolute deviations efficiently, demonstrating a concise solution.
