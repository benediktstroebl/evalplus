Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script provides a function `mean_absolute_deviation()` that accepts a list of numbers and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in that list. It utilizes the NumPy library to provide efficient numerical operations and calculations. To calculate the mean absolute deviation, it converts the input list of numbers into a NumPy array, calculates the mean of this array, and then computes the absolute difference between each element and the mean, finally returning the mean of these absolute differences, which represents the desired metric. This allows for a more concise and efficient solution compared to a pure Python implementation. 
The function is self-contained and does not rely on any external variables or contexts, making it reusable and easy to maintain. Paired with proper testing, it ensures the correctness of the calculations and provides a reliable solution for calculating mean absolute deviation in various scenarios.
