Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script uses the numpy library to calculate the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. The function `mean_absolute_deviation` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the list. 

The function creates a numpy array from the input list of numbers. It then calculates the mean of the array and subtracts it from each number in the array to get the deviation from the mean for each number. Then, it calculates the absolute value of each deviation from the mean, finds the mean of these absolute deviations, and returns this value as the mean absolute deviation of the input list. 

This approach takes advantage of numpy's efficient numerical operations to calculate the mean absolute deviation faster than pure Python approaches, especially for large datasets.

Note: Make sure to have the numpy library installed to use this script:
```bash
pip install numpy
``` 
This way, the provided code will run independently without needing any additional dependencies.
