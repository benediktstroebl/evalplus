Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script utilizes the `numpy` library, making the code more efficient for numerical computations. The function `mean_absolute_deviation` takes a list of numbers, constructs a numpy array, and computes the mean absolute deviation using numpy's built-in functions, ultimately returning the result. The use of numpy not only enhances computational performance but also ensures accuracy and robustness in numerical operations. 
For basic testing, the result of the function when applied to a list of four numbers is:
```python
>>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
1.0
```
This result matches the example provided in the problem statement.

Also, a more comprehensive testing could involve a set of more diverse test cases to cover a wider range of scenarios, ensuring the function's robustness and accuracy in various contexts. Such tests might include empty lists, lists with a small or large number of elements, lists with identical numbers, and more.
