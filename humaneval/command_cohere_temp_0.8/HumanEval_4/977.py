Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script solves the problem of calculating the mean absolute deviation for a list of numbers using the `mean_absolute_deviation` function. It utilizes the `numpy` library to perform numerical operations efficiently. The function takes a list of numbers as input, calculates the absolute differences between each element and the mean of the list, and then returns the mean of these absolute differences, resulting in the Mean Absolute Deviation. This approach ensures accurate and reliable calculations, making it an advantageous solution for quantitative analysis.

For testing purposes, you can attach a test suite to verify the function's behavior against known examples. Here's an example of a test case that checks the function's output against the expected result:
```python
import unittest

class TestMeanAbsoluteDeviation(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_mean_absolute_deviation(self):
        numbers = [1., 2., 3., 4.]
        self.assertAlmostEqual(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers), 1.0, places=1)
```
In the test case, the `test_mean_absolute_deviation` function verifies the output of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function against the expected result (1.0) for a specific list of numbers ([1., 2., 3., 4.]). The `assertAlmostEqual` method is used to perform an assertion with a specified precision (in this case, 1 decimal place).
