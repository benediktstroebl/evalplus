Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and returns the mean absolute deviation of the list.

The function first converts the list of numbers into a numpy array. Then, it calculates the mean of the array and subtracts it from each number in the array to get the deviation from the mean for each number. Finally, it takes the absolute value of each deviation and calculates the mean to return as the final answer.

The script utilizes the numpy library, which is highly efficient for numerical operations on arrays and lists of numbers, making the code more efficient and readable.

Note that this solution assumes that the list of numbers is already sorted. If the list is not sorted, the result may not be accurate. 

To ensure accuracy, you may consider sorting the input list before calculating the mean absolute deviation. Here's an example of how you can modify the code to sort the input list:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(sorted_numbers) - np.mean(np.array(sorted_numbers))))
```
In this modified version, the input list is sorted using the `sorted` function before proceeding with the calculation. Sorting ensures consistent results, especially if the input list is not already sorted. 
Remember to consider this approach if your input data is not guaranteed to be sorted. 
It's also important to note that the numpy array method simplifies the calculation, making the code more efficient and easier to understand.
