Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script uses the numpy library to handle numerical operations and utilize built-in functions for mean and absolute deviations. The `mean_absolute_deviation` function takes a list of numbers `List[float]` as input and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation of the list of numbers. It employs numpy to compute the mean of the absolute deviations between each element i in the list and the mean of the entire list, resulting in a more efficient and concise solution. 
To see the full capabilities of the numpy library and other statistical measures, you can check out their official [documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/).
