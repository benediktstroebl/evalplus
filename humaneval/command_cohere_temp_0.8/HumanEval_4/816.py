Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    :param numbers: List of input numbers
    :return: Mean Absolute Deviation
    """
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and calculates the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list. 

The Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) is a measure of the variability of a dataset, it calculates the average absolute difference between each element and the mean of the dataset. 

The function first converts the list of numbers into a numpy array, then calculates the mean of the array. It then subtracts the mean from each number in the array and calculates the absolute value of each difference. Finally, it returns the mean of these absolute differences as the Mean Absolute Deviation. 

To ensure reliability, the script uses the numpy library to efficiently handle numerical operations and utilize built-in functions for mean and absolute operations. This ensures accuracy and reduces the need for explicit loops and operations that could lead to errors. 
```python
test_mad = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(test_mad))  # Expected output: 1.0
```
This test case demonstrates the use of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function with a list of four numbers [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], and the expected output is 1.0.  This result meets the problem's expected output, indicating the correctness of the implemented function.
