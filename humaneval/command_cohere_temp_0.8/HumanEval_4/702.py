Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script uses the `numpy` library to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers. The `mean_absolute_deviation` function takes a list of floats as input and returns the MAD value. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:
1. The function `mean_absolute_deviation` takes a list of numbers as input, specifically `List[float]` as denoted by the type hinting.
2. Inside the function, `np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers)))` does the following:
- `np.abs()` calculates the absolute value of the difference.
- `np.array(numbers)` converts the list of numbers into a NumPy array for easier calculations.
- `np.mean()` calculates the mean of the NumPy array.
- `np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers)))` calculates the absolute difference between each number and the mean.
3. `np.mean()` is then used again to calculate the average of these absolute differences, which provides the Mean Absolute Deviation of the provided list of numbers. 

This approach leverages NumPy's efficient array operations to calculate the MAD in a more concise and faster manner compared to doing it manually loop-by-loop.

Note: Remember to install NumPy (`pip install numpy`) before using this script if you haven't already. And while this solution is more efficient, you should consider the trade-offs if you're working with a dataset with a large number of elements, as NumPy's array operations can consume more memory compared to native Python lists.
