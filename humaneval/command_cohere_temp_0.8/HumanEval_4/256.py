Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. The function utilizes the NumPy library to perform vectorized operations on the input list, computing the absolute differences between each element and the mean of the list, and then returning the mean of these absolute differences. This approach provides a concise and efficient solution for calculating the mean absolute deviation, which is a common measure of variability in statistics. 
```python
# The following block of code represents a self-contained Python script
# that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests.

from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))

# Example usage:
>>> numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
>>> result = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)
>>> print(result)  # Should print: 1.0
```
This script includes type annotations using Python's typing module to specify the input parameter as a list of float values, indicating the expected data type for the function argument.

To ensure efficiency and accuracy, the script leverages the NumPy library to handle numerical operations on the input list. NumPy arrays are used to perform calculations, enhancing performance and avoiding explicit loops.

The result is a concise and well-structured Python function that solves the problem statement and provides the mean absolute deviation of the input list of numbers, conforming to Python best practices and utilizing existing numerical libraries.
