Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script utilizes the `numpy` library, specifically the `mean` and `abs` functions, to efficiently compute the mean absolute deviation of the input list of numbers. To improve code readability, the script adopts the typing module to denote the expected input type, providing a clear indication of the function's expectation.

To use this function, ensure that the `numpy` library is installed by running `pip install numpy`. You can then import the library and utilize the `mean_absolute_deviation` function to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation for any list of numbers. 

For example:
```python
import numpy as np

numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
result = np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
print(result)
```
This code will calculate and print the Mean Absolute Deviation for the list of numbers [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0].  The output of which will be:
```
1.0
```
