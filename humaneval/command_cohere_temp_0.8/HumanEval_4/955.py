Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of calculating the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    :param numbers: List of input numbers
    :return: Mean Absolute Deviation
    """
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```

This script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and returns the mean absolute deviation of the list.

The function first creates a NumPy array from the list of numbers. It then calculates the mean of the array and subtracts each number in the array from the mean to find the difference. Finally, it takes the absolute value of each difference and calculates the mean to return the mean absolute deviation of the list. 

This approach utilizes NumPy's efficient array operations, ensuring a quick and reliable calculation of the Mean Absolute Deviation. 
```python
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))  # Expected: 1.0
```
This script will print the correct Mean Absolute Deviation of the list, which in this case is 1.0.
