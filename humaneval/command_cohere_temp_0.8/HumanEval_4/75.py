Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It utilizes the `numpy` library to operate on arrays and perform calculations efficiently. The mean absolute deviation is computed by creating a numpy array from the input list, calculating the mean of the array, and then finding the absolute deviation of each element from the mean, finally returning the mean of these absolute deviations. 
This approach allows for more concise and efficient code, while still providing the same functionality as requested in the prompt. 

To use this function correctly, please ensure that you have the 'numpy' library installed. You can do so by running `pip install numpy` or adding `numpy` to your `requirements.txt` file if you're working on a Python project.
