Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers. The function takes a list of floats as input and returns the MAD value. 

To compute the MAD, the function uses the NumPy library to perform the necessary calculations efficiently. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:
1. The input list of numbers is converted into a NumPy array, which allows for faster numerical operations.
2. The NumPy array is used to calculate the mean of the values using the `np.mean` function. This provides the mean value of the dataset.
3. The code then subtracts the mean value from each value in the NumPy array using `np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers)))`. This creates an array of absolute differences between each value and the mean.
4. The mean of these absolute differences is calculated again using `np.mean`. This step computes the average absolute deviation from the mean, which is the MAD value.

The script returns the calculated MAD value, which provides an indication of the variability of the dataset, measuring how spread out the values are from the mean.
