Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation of a list of numbers. It utilizes the numpy library to operate on the input list and calculate the absolute deviations from the mean, and then computes the average of these absolute deviations to provide the Mean Absolute Deviation value, which is a robust measure of dispersion in statistics. 
The function is self-contained and does not rely on any external variables or contexts, and it can be safely run in any Python environment with numpy installed. 
It is important to note that the math and numpy libraries are standard with Python, so there is no need to install them separately.  own environment. You can copy this code block and run it in your Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment to test it with different datasets.
