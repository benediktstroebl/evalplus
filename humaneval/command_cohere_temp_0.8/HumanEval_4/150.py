Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of calculating the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```

The function `mean_absolute_deviation` calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It utilizes the `numpy` library to operate on the input list and calculate the deviation. Firstly, the input list is converted into a numpy array for easier manipulation. Then, the mean of the array is computed using the `np.mean` function. Subsequent to that, the absolute differences between each element and the mean are calculated using the `np.abs` function, followed by the mean operation over these differences, thereby yielding the Mean Absolute Deviation. 

The above approach has a time complexity of `O(n)` since it operates on each element of the list only once, thereby maintaining the efficiency of the original prompt.

This script can be executed directly and tested using the provided test case to verify its behavior. 
```python
assert mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]) == 1.0
``` 
This will help validate its correctness against expected outcomes.
