Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
The function `mean_absolute_deviation` calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It utilizes the NumPy library to perform the necessary calculations efficiently. 

Here's an example of using the function:
```python
print(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]))
```
For the input list `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]`, the expected output is:
```
1.0
```
This demonstrates the accurate calculation of the mean absolute deviation using the provided function.
