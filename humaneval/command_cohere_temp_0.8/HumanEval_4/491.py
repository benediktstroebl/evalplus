Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script utilizes the numpy library to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation, providing a more efficient implementation with fewer lines of code. The function 'mean_absolute_deviation' takes a list of numbers as input and returns the MAD value.

To better understand the process, here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. The list of numbers is converted into a numpy array by the 'np.array' function.
2. Oftentimes, the computation of the Mean Absolute Deviation requires the calculation of squared differences. However, the 'np.abs' function in numpy directly calculates the absolute value difference, making the code more concise.
3. The mean of the numbers is computed via the 'np.mean' function.
4. The absolute differences between each element and the mean are calculated and then averaged to determine the Mean Absolute Deviation.

This approach leverages the efficient and optimized numerical computations of the numpy library, resulting in a quicker execution time and a more compact code structure.
