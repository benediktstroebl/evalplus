Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script solves the problem of calculating the mean absolute deviation for a list of numbers using the `mean_absolute_deviation` function. It utilizes the NumPy library to perform vectorized operations on the input list, computing the absolute differences between each element and the mean of the list, and then returning the mean of these absolute differences, which represents the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD). This approach is both efficient and accurate, and it adheres to the expected result for the provided test case.

Here is a markdown code block with the corresponding test case to verify the functionality of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
expected_mad = 1.0

result = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)

print(f"For the list {numbers}, the calculated Mean Absolute Deviation is: {result}")
print(f"Expected MAD is: {expected_mad}")

assert result == expected_mad
```
This test case provides a list of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] and the expected Mean Absolute Deviation (1.0). The function is invoked with these inputs and the results are printed. The assertion checks that the calculated MAD matches the expected value, confirming the correctness of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function.
