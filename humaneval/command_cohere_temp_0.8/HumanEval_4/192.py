Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It utilizes the NumPy library to efficiently handle array operations, computing the absolute deviations between each element and the mean, and then returns the mean of these absolute deviations, which provides a measure of the data spread in absolute terms relative to the mean. 
The NumPy array creation and mathematical operations are used to compute the mean absolute deviation, demonstrating efficient and accurate data analysis.
