Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and calculates the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of the numbers in the list. 

The MAD is a measure of the variability of the data set and is defined as the average absolute difference between each element in the list and the mean of the list. 

The script utilizes the `numpy` library to perform numerical operations, including vectorized absolute deviations and mean calculation, on the array representation of the input list, ensuring efficiency and simplicity. 

The result is a straightforward solution that neatly encapsulates the computation of MAD within the function, providing a single value that expresses the dataset's dispersion from its centerpoint.
