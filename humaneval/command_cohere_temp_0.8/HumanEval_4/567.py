Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you've described, along with a series of tests to validate its correctness:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import pytest

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))

def test_mad_valid_input():
    # Test case for valid input list
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    expected = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)
    result = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)
    
    assert result == expected

def test_mad_empty_list():
    # Test case for empty list
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        mean_absolute_deviation([])

def test_mad_single_number():
    # Test case for a single number input
    number = 10
    expected = 0
    result = mean_absolute_deviation([number])
    
    assert result == expected

def test_mad_negative_numbers():
    # Test case for negative numbers
    numbers = [-1, -2, 3, 4, -5]
    result = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)
    assert result >= 0 

def test_mad_large_numbers():
    # Test case for large numbers
    numbers = [1000, 1500, 200, 2500, 3000]
    expected = np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
    result = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)
    
    assert result == expected 

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pytest.main()
```

In this script, we use the `numpy` library to handle numerical operations, which provides a more efficient and accurate calculation. The `test_mad_valid_input()` function verifies that the function behaves as expected with a valid input list. The `test_mad_empty_list()` function tests the function with an empty list, which should raise a `ValueError`. The `test_mad_single_number()` function tests the function with a list containing a single number, and the `test_mad_negative_numbers()` and `test_mad_large_numbers()` functions test the function's behavior with lists containing negative or large numbers, respectively. 

Make sure you have the `numpy` library installed (`pip install numpy`) before running the script. When executed, the script will run the tests and report any failures.
