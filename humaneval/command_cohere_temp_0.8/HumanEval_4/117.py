Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list.

The function then uses NumPy to compute the mean of the absolute deviations of each number in the list from the mean of the list. 

It employs the `List` annotation from Python's typing module to ensure that the function takes in a list of float values as input, and returns the mean absolute deviation of those numbers, resulting in an accurate and efficient solution. 

You can verify the accuracy of this function by executing the following code:
```python
>>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
1.0
```
This will return the mean absolute deviation for the list `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]`, which is 1.0. 

This aligns with the expectation that the mean absolute deviation should be close to zero, given that the mean of this list is approximately 2.0, and the majority of the numbers in the list are close to this mean.
