Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script uses the `numpy` library to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers. The function `mean_absolute_deviation` takes a list of floats `numbers` as input and returns the MAD value. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:
- Import the `List` and `numpy` modules at the beginning of the script, allowing us to work with lists and numerical operations efficiently.
- The `mean_absolute_deviation` function takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the absolute deviation of each number from the mean of the numbers. 
- It achieves this by using `numpy.array` to convert the list to a NumPy array, which allows for more optimized mathematical operations.
- Then, it calculates the mean of the array using `np.mean` and subtracts the mean from each element of the array using `np.abs`. This results in an array of absolute deviations.
- Finally, it calculates the mean of these absolute deviations using `np.mean`, which provides the desired Mean Absolute Deviation. The entire process leverages the power of NumPy to perform these computations efficiently. 

This provides a more concise and efficient solution while maintaining readability and elegance. You can modify the `numbers` list with different test cases to ensure the function's correctness. This solution is self-contained, easy to understand, and applies the MAD formula to calculate the mean absolute deviation correctly.
