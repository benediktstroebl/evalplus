Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script uses the `numpy` library to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers. The function `mean_absolute_deviation` takes a list of floats `numbers` as input and returns the MAD of the dataset. 

To compute the MAD, the following steps are performed:
1. The input list is converted to a NumPy array for efficient processing.
2. The NumPy array is used to calculate the mean of the dataset using the `np.mean` function.
3. The code then calculates the absolute deviation from the mean for each data point by subtracting the mean from each number and taking the absolute value using the `np.abs` function.
4. Finally, it calculates the mean of these absolute deviations using the `np.mean` function, resulting in the Mean Absolute Deviation value.

This solution is efficient and accurate, and it leverages NumPy's statistical capabilities to perform the calculations effortlessly. Note that the NumPy library must be installed for this code to operate correctly:
```bash
pip install numpy
```
