Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script utilizes the `numpy` library, alongside the `typing` module for type hints, to efficiently compute the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers. The function `mean_absolute_deviation` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the MAD value. To ensure accuracy, it uses numpy arrays for efficient numerical operations, computing the mean of the array and then calculating the absolute deviation from the mean for each number, ultimately returning the mean of these absolute deviations as the MAD. 
This approach ensures that the function adheres to the specified problem definition and provides an accurate solution while maintaining efficiency in computation.
