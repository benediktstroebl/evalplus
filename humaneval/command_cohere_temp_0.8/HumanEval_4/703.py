Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
The function `mean_absolute_deviation` calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It utilizes the `numpy` library to operate on the input list as a one-dimensional array, computing the absolute differences between each element and the mean of the list. These differences are then averaged to determine the desired metric.
