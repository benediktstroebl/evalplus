Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
The function `mean_absolute_deviation` calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It utilizes the `numpy` library to operate on the input list and calculate the deviation. Firstly, the input list is converted into a numpy array for easier mathematical operations. Then, the mean of the array is calculated, and the absolute deviations from this mean are computed using `np.abs()`. Finally, the mean of these absolute deviations yields the desired result, which is returned. 
This approach guarantees accurate and efficient computation of the mean absolute deviation.
