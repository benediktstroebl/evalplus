Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of calculating the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))

# Example usage
print(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]))
```

The above code uses the `numpy` library to provide an efficient implementation of calculating the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD). The function `mean_absolute_deviation` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the MAD value. 

The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with a sample list of numbers and prints the calculated MAD. You can replace the `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]` list with any list of numbers to compute the MAD for that specific dataset. 

Let's break down the code:
- The libraries **numpy** and **typing** are imported into the code.
- The `mean_absolute_deviation()` function takes a list of floating numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the list. 
- The code uses **numpy** to make computations more efficient using its array operations, the `np.abs()` function calculates the absolute value of the difference of each element in the list with the mean, and the `np.mean()` function calculates the mean of the calculated absolute values, thus returning the Mean Absolute Deviation value.
- Example usage is provided, where the function is called with a sample list and the result is printed.

This solution is concise, efficient, and follows Python best practices, providing a functional implementation of the Mean Absolute Deviation calculation.
