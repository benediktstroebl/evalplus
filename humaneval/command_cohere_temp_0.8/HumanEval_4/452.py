Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script utilizes the `numpy` library, specifically the `mean` and `abs` functions, to efficiently compute the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. To ensure correctness, it adheres to the principle of isolation, encapsulating the necessary logic within the `mean_absolute_deviation` function and avoiding any unnecessary external dependencies.

To apply this function to a specific use case, you can define a list of numbers in the official Markdown cell and invoke the function, as demonstrated in the original problem statement:
```python
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))  # Output: 1.0
```
This demonstrates the practical application of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function to evaluate data variability using the MAD metric.
