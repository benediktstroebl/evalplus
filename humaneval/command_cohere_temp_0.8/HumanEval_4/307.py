Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of calculating the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```

The function `mean_absolute_deviation` calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It first converts the input list to a NumPy array and calculates the mean of the array. Then, it subtracts the mean from each number in the array and calculates the absolute values of these differences. Finally, it returns the mean of these absolute differences as the mean absolute deviation.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```python
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
result = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)
print(result)
```

Output:
1.0

This script has type annotations for improved readability and usability, follows Python best practices, and uses the NumPy library to handle vector operations for efficiency and simplicity. The function is self-contained and can be easily reused and integrated into larger projects.

Note: To have this function work without the 'numpy' library, you could instead use the following code:
```python
def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    mean = sum(numbers)/len(numbers)
    sum_of_absolute_deviations = sum(abs(num-mean) for num in numbers)
    return sum_of_absolute_deviations/len(numbers)
```

This will compute the mean absolute deviation without relying on the 'numpy' library. However, this will involve explicit loops over the dataset, which could be prone to errors like datatype coercion or complexity issues with large datasets.
