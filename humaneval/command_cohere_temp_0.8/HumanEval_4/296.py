Here's a Python script that includes a function to calculate the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    :param numbers: List of input numbers
    :return: Mean Absolute Deviation of the input list
    """
    mean = math.mean(numbers)
    deviation = sum(math.abs(num - mean) for num in numbers) / len(numbers)
    return deviation
```

This script includes a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the list. The function calculates the mean of the numbers in the list and then calculates the absolute deviation of each number from the mean. The average of these absolute deviations is then returned as the mean absolute deviation of the list. 

To ensure the script behaves as expected, it utilizes the `math` module to compute the mean and absolute deviations. However, to effectively validate the functionality of this script, an additional list of test cases is required. These test cases should encompass a range of scenarios, such as lists with diverse numbers of elements and numeric data points, to ensure that the function appropriately carries out its task.
