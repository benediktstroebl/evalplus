Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script utilizes the `numpy` library, ensuring efficiency in handling numerical operations, especially when dealing with large datasets.

To use this function, ensure that the `numpy` library is installed by running `pip install numpy`. You can then import the required module as follows:
```python
import numpy as np
``` 

The function `mean_absolute_deviation` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list. 

The function can be used as follows:
```python
print(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]))
```
This will output:
```
1.0
```

This value indicates that the dataset is concentrated around the mean, with virtually no deviation. 

This approach provides a precise solution while maintaining code simplicity, robustness, and compatibility with Python's typing system.
