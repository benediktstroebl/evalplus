Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script utilizes the `numpy` library, making the code more efficient for numerical computations. The function `mean_absolute_deviation` takes a list of numbers, calculates the mean of the list using NumPy's `mean` function, and then computes the absolute deviation of each number from the mean using NumPy's `abs` function and `array` function to handle the list input. Finally, it again uses NumPy's `mean` function to calculate the average of these absolute deviations, resulting in the Mean Absolute Deviation of the dataset. This approach is particularly advantageous for numerical operations and avoids the need for explicit loops and reductions, leading to more concise and efficient code. 
To use this function correctly, please ensure that the 'numpy' library is installed:
```bash
pip install numpy
```
