Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list.

The function first converts the list of numbers into a numpy array. Then, it calculates the mean of the numbers in the array and subtracts it from each number in the array to calculate the absolute deviation from the mean for each number. Finally, it returns the mean of the absolute deviations.

The numpy array and mean functions provide efficient and accurate computations for large datasets if the `numpy` library is installed. 

This solution passes the provided tests and provides a clean and simple implementation. You can add this code to the script you've previously uploaded or copy and paste it into your current environment.
