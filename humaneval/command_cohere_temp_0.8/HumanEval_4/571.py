Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and calculates the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list. 

The `mean_absolute_deviation` function leverages the NumPy library to perform the necessary calculations efficiently. It first converts the input list of numbers into a NumPy array, `np.array(numbers)`. Then, it computes the mean of the array using `np.mean(np.array(numbers))`, which represents the centerpoint of the distribution. Subsequently, it calculates the absolute deviation from the mean for each number in the array by subtracting the mean from each number and taking the absolute value using `np.abs()`. Finally, it returns the mean of these absolute deviations as the overall mean absolute deviation for the given list of numbers. 

Overall, this script provides an accurate and efficient way to compute the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers.
