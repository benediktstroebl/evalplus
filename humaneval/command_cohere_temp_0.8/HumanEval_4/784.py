Here's a Python script that includes a function to calculate the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    mean = math.fmean(numbers)
    deviation = sum(math.fabs(x - mean) for x in numbers)
    return deviation / len(numbers)
```

This function takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the mean absolute deviation, which is the average of the absolute differences between each element in the list and the mean of the list. 

To implement the formula, we first calculate the mean of the numbers input using the `math.fmean()` function. We then use a list comprehension to calculate the absolute deviation of each number from the mean, summing them up using `sum()`. Finally, we divide the total absolute deviation by the number of data points to obtain the mean absolute deviation. 

This approach provides a clear understanding of the formula and avoids the need for a separate explanation of the formula's components, keeping the response focused on providing a solution.
