Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script utilizes the numpy library to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation, providing a more efficient implementation. The function 'mean_absolute_deviation' takes a list of numbers as input and returns the MAD value.

To authenticate the correctness of the implementation, consider asserting the result against a known output using a test case, like so:
```python
# Test case for the mean_absolute_deviation function
def test_mad():
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    expected_result = 1.0
    result = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)
    assert result == expected_result
```
This test case ensures that the function 'mean_absolute_deviation' produces the expected result when provided a list of numbers.[1]
