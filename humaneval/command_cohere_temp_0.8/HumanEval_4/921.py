Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you've described, along with a markdown code block showing the code and detailed comments:
```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    For a given list of input numbers, calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and the mean of the list.

    Parameters:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of numerical data.

    Returns:
        float: The Mean Absolute Deviation of the input list.
    """
    return mean_absolute_deviation_helper(numbers, len(numbers))

def mean_absolute_deviation_helper(numbers: List[float], n: int) -> float:
    """
    Helper function to calculate Mean Absolute Deviation.
    This function is refactored to have a clearer variable name and avoid mutating parameters.
    
    Parameters:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of numerical data.
        n (int): The size of the dataset
    
    Returns:
        float: The Mean Absolute Deviation of the input list.
    """
    mean = sum(numbers) / n
    devations = [abs(x - mean) for x in numbers]
    return sum(devations) / n
```

This script includes the `mean_absolute_deviation()` function, which takes a list of numbers (`List[float])` as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in that list. The function is implemented using a helper function called `mean_absolute_deviation_helper()` to make the code more readable and avoid mutating parameter values.

The `mean_absolute_deviation_helper()` function takes two parameters: `numbers` (the input list of numbers) and `n` (the number of elements in the list). It calculates the mean of the numbers and the absolute deviations from the mean, and then returns the average of these absolute deviations.

Both functions include comments to clarify their purpose and the functionality of the code within. When executed, the code should run without errors and provide the correct Mean Absolute Deviation for the given dataset. 
```python
# Test the function with a sample dataset
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))  # Output: 1.0
```
