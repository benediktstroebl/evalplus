Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script utilizes the `numpy` library, specifically the `np.mean`, `np.abs`, and `np.array` functions. The `mean_absolute_deviation` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list. It first converts the input list into a numpy array, then calculates the mean of the elements in the array. It then subtracts the mean from each element, calculates the absolute value of each difference, and finally returns the average of these absolute differences, which gives the mean absolute deviation of the provided list. 
This approach leverages NumPy's efficient array operations, resulting in a concise and numerically robust solution. 

You can install numpy like so:
```
pip install numpy
```
And you can verify the functionality of the function using an example:
```python
>>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
1.0
```
