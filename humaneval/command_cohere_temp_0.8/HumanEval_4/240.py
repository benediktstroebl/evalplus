Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
The function `mean_absolute_deviation` calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers. It utilizes the NumPy library to perform the necessary computations efficiently. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:
1. The function takes a list of numbers as input, which is parameterized by the `List[float]` type.
2. It imports the `numpy` library and uses `np.array(numbers)` to convert the input list of numbers into a NumPy array, which allows for faster and more efficient mathematical operations on the data.
3. `np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))` calculates the mean of the absolute differences between each element in the array and the mean of the array. The `np.abs()` function ensures that only the absolute values are considered, reflecting the absolute deviation.

The resulting mean absolute deviation value is returned by the function.
