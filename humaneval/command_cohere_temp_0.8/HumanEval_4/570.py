Here's a Python script that includes a function to calculate the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    mean = math.fmean(numbers)
    deviation = sum(math.fabs(x - mean) for x in numbers)
    return deviation / len(numbers)
```
This script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of floating numbers and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list. 

The function calculates the mean of the numbers in the list using the `math.fmean` function. It then calculates the absolute deviation by summing the absolute values of the differences between each number in the list and the mean, using a list comprehension and the `math.fabs` function. The calculation is concluded by returning the average deviation as the sum divided by the number of elements in the list. 

The `mean_absolute_deviation` function is designed to provide a measure of the variability of a dataset, by measuring the average distance between each data point and the mean, without considering the direction. 

To ensure correctness, the code is built upon the `typing` module and the `math` library, which support the proper handling of floating numbers and pagination. 

To better understand the function, an example of use is provided below: 
```python
>>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
1.0
```
This example will return the mean absolute deviation as 1.0, implying that the numbers in the list are all evenly spaced around the mean, and implying perfectly consistent data. 

This script can be used as a standalone function in other Python scripts to calculate the mean absolute deviation of lists of numbers.  It can be easily integrated with tests to ensure the robustness of this specific implementation.
