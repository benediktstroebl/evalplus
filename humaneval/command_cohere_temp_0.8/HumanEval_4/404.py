Here's a Python script that includes a function to calculate the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import unittest

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))

class TestMeanAbsoluteDeviation(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_basic(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([1., 2., 3., 4.]), 1.0)
    def test_EmptyList(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([]), 0.)
    def test_OnlyOneValue(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([10.0]), 0.)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
This script includes a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It uses the numpy library to operate on the input list and calculate the deviation.

The script also includes a test suite called `TestMeanAbsoluteDeviation` that checks the correctness of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function. It comprises three test functions: `test_basic`, which tests the function against a sample list of numbers; `test_empty_list`, which checks if the function handles an empty list correctly; and `test_only_one_value`, which verifies if the function handles a list with only one value correctly.

When executed, the script runs the test suite to validate the functionality of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function. You can execute this script to see if the function passes all the tests, which signifies its correct implementation.  This approach allows us to thoroughly test our function and ensure its reliability. If changes to the function are needed, this testing framework will re-evaluate the modified function and alert us if we have introduced any bugs in the process. 
The desired output is that all tests would pass, demonstrating the successful implementation of the function. 

This code lays a foundation for including more tests if needed, especially around edge cases or specific use cases you might encounter in the future. This approach to testing ensures the continuous reliability of our code and is a good practice in software development. Gaining confidence in the code and its behavior is crucial for maintaining code quality and preventing issues in the long run.
