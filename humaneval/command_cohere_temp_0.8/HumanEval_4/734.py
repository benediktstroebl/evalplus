Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of calculating the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))

# Tests
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
expected_output = math.fsum(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers)))) / len(numbers)
print(f"Test case: Expected {'success' if mean_absolute_deviation(numbers) == expected_output else 'failure'}")
```
This script utilizes the `numpy` library, which provides `np.abs` for element-wise absolute deviation and `np.mean` for mean calculation. The `math.fsum` helps sum the absolute deviations efficiently. The test case checks if the result matches the expected output. Adjust the `numbers` list and expected output according to your dataset and expectations. 
This script ensures the correct calculation of the Mean Absolute Deviation and facilitates the addition of more test cases as needed.
