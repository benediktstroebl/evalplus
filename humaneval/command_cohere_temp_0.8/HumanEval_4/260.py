Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It uses the NumPy library to perform vectorized operations on the input list, computing the absolute differences between each element and the mean of the list, and then returning the mean of these absolute deviations. This approach is more efficient than brute-force iteration and enhances the performance of the calculation, especially for large datasets.

Here's an example of using this function:
```python
print(f"Mean Absolute Deviation of [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]: {mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])}")
```
The output will be:
```
Mean Absolute Deviation of [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]: 1.0
```
This demonstrates the application of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function to the specified list, yielding a mean absolute deviation of 1.0, which is accurate for the provided dataset.
