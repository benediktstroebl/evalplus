Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script solves the problem of calculating the mean absolute deviation for a list of numbers using the `mean_absolute_deviation` function. It utilizes the NumPy library to perform vectorized operations on the input list, computing the absolute differences between each element and the mean of the list, and then calculating the mean of these absolute differences to yield the mean absolute deviation. This approach is both efficient and accurate, and it adheres to the expected algorithm for solving this statistical problem. 
It returns the mean absolute deviation value.  feel free to adapt this solution to your needs or explore different statistical measures! Let me know if you would like to dive deeper into any specific aspect of this solution or any other advanced statistical concepts.
