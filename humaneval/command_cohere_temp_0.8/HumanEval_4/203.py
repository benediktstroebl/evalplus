Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script utilizes the `numpy` library, specifically the `np.mean`, `np.abs`, and `np.array` functions. The `mean_absolute_deviation` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list. It first converts the input list into a numpy array, then calculates the mean of the array, and finally computes the absolute deviation of each element in the array from its mean, finally returning the average of these deviations. This script ensures correctness and efficiency in solving the problem. 
Note: Ensure the 'numpy' library is installed to execute this code.
