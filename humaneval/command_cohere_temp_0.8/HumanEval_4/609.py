Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
The function `mean_absolute_deviation` calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It utilizes the NumPy library to perform the computations efficiently. 

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```python
print(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]))
```
This would output:
```
1.0
```

This value reflects the quality of the dataset regarding variability around the mean. In this case, the mean absolute deviation of the dataset [1, 2, 3, 4] is 1.0, indicating a low deviation from the mean (2.0).
