Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list. 

The function employs NumPy to compute the mean and absolute deviations in a vectorized manner, which is efficient for large datasets.

And here is a downsized example list to showcase the function:
```python
>>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)
1.0
```
This demonstrates that the function correctly calculates the mean absolute deviation of the provided list.
