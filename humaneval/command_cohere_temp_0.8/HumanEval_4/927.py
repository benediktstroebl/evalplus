Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list.

The function then uses NumPy to compute the mean of the absolute deviations between each element i in the list and the mean of the list m:
```
(mx) = np.mean(x)
```
For each element i in the list we compute the absolute deviation:
```
ai = abs(xi - mx) 
```
The final result of the function is the mean of the absolute deviations ai computed over the entire list. 

Overall, this script provides a functional implementation of the mean absolute deviation calculation. Let me know if you would like any adjustments made to the code!
