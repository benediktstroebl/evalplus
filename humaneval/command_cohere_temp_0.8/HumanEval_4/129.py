Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script utilizes the `numpy` library to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation, MAD, of a list of numbers. First, the list of numbers is converted into a numpy array for ease of manipulation. Then, the mean of the array is calculated, and the absolute deviations from this mean are computed using numpy's absolute value function. Finally, the mean of these absolute deviations yields the MAD, which is returned. This efficient use of numpy accelerates the computations involved in the calculation of MAD.
