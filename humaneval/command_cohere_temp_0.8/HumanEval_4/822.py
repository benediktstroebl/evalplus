Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    :param numbers: List of input numbers
    :return: Mean Absolute Deviation value
    """
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script utilizes the `numpy` library, which provides a more efficient calculation method. The function `mean_absolute_deviation` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the list, which is the average absolute difference between each element and the mean of the list. 

Here's an example of how to use the function:
```python
print(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]))
```
This would print:
```bash
1.0
```

This value equals the expected output. 

To ensure that the script remains self-contained, the `numpy` library is imported at the beginning of the script. However, to avoid dependency issues, it may be advisable to install `numpy` via `pip` in the environment where you are running this script.  This way, the script remains portable and usable in various contexts without requiring additional dependencies.  If this approach is feasible for your use case, including a `requirements.txt` file or a `Pipfile` with the necessary dependencies can also ensure smooth operation during deployment.
