Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list.

The function first converts the list of numbers into a numpy array. Then, it calculates the mean of the numbers in the array and subtracts it from each number in the array to find the difference from the mean for each number. Finally, it finds the absolute value of these differences and calculates their mean, returning the result. 

This provides an effective and efficient solution to the problem, as evidenced by passing tests. 
```python
# Test: Single data set
assert mean_absolute_deviation([1, 2, 3, 4]) == 1

# Test: Data set with mean=0
assert mean_absolute_deviation([0, 0, 0, 0]) == 0

# Test: Data set with all equal
assert mean_absolute_deviation([1, 1, 1, 1]) == 0

# Test: Large dataset
assert mean_absolute_deviation([1 for i in range(10000)]) == 0
``` 
This script demonstrates proper use of the NumPy library for array operations and validates the function against several test cases, ensuring its effectiveness and correctness.
