Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you've outlined, along with a separate test case to validate its correctness:
```python
# Type hints:
from typing import List

# Function:
def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    """
    # Ensure list is not empty:
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Input list is empty.")
    
    # Calculate mean:
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    
    # Calculate absolute deviations from the mean:
    absolute_deviations = [abs(num - mean) for num in numbers]
    
    # Return the mean of absolute deviations:
    return sum(absolute_deviations) / len(numbers)

# Test case:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
expected_result = sum([abs(num - (sum(numbers) / len(numbers))) for num in numbers]) / len(numbers)

print(f"Test case: Is {mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)} equal to expected result {expected_result}? (They should be equal.)")
```
This script includes a function, `mean_absolute_deviation`, that calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It's tested against a known answer to verify its correctness. Adjust the `numbers` list in the test case to validate it against different inputs.
