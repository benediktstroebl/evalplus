Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script utilizes the `numpy` library, making the code more efficient. The logic correctly calculates the mean absolute deviation of the input list of numbers.

To adapt this code for a standalone environment, ensure the `numpy` library is installed. Typically, this is included in the Python environment, but if not, you can execute `!pip install numpy` in your Colab or Jupyter environment. 

This way, the code will function appropriately in isolation.
