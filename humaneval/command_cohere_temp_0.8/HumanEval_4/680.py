Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It utilizes the NumPy library to handle array operations and calculates the absolute differences between each element and the mean of the list, then returns the mean of these absolute differences, which provides a measure of the variability of the data points from the mean in an intuitive way. 
```python
assert mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]) == 1.0
assert mean_absolute_deviation([0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0]) == 0.5
assert mean_absolute_deviation([-1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0]) == 1.0
```
This function can be used to robustly estimate the central tendency of a data set, accommodating both positive and negative deviations from the mean and handling numerical and statistical analysis tasks.
