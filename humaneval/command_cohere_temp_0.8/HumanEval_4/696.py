Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script uses the `numpy` library to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers. The `mean_absolute_deviation` function takes a list of floats as input and returns the MAD value. 

To compute the MAD, the function follows these steps:
1. Import the numpy library as np.
2. Convert the input list of numbers into a numpy array by using np.array(numbers). This allows numpy to handle the efficient calculation of mean and absolute deviations.
3. Find the mean of the numpy array with np.mean(np.array(numbers)). This calculates the average of the input list of numbers.
4. Calculate the absolute deviations from the mean by subtracting the mean value obtained in the previous step from each number in the numpy array. This is achieved using np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))).
5. Compute the mean of the absolute deviations with np.mean(abs_deviations). This gives us the Mean Absolute Deviation.

The script returns the calculated Mean Absolute Deviation as the output, which represents a robust measure of the variability of the dataset relative to the data points' distribution around the mean. 
This approach leverages the efficient numerical procedures provided by numpy leading to more accurate calculations, especially for large datasets. Gives a clear and understandable solution by providing the numerical computations in a concise manner. 
The MAD value signifies the average absolute difference between each data point and the mean, giving a measure of the dataset's dispersion without penalizing values that differ from the mean by large positive or negative values equally. 
This approach offers a good balance between computational efficiency and clarity of explanation. 
It is important to note that due to the inclusion of the numpy library, users should install numpy in their environment before using this script, ensuring seamless accessibility to the mad calculation function. 
Additionally, incorporating this library allows for efficient computation of mad values for larger datasets, promoting scalability and practicality. This MAD value gives a profound understanding of the dataset's distribution and is a pivotal metric in data analysis, aiding in interpreting central tendency and variability aspects.
