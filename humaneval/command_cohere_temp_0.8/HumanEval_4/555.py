Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script utilizes the numpy library to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation, MAD, of a list of numbers. First, the function imports the numpy library as np, which is a widely used library for numerical operations in Python. It also annotates the function with the List annotation, which suggests a more rigorous type-checking mechanism to guarantee parameter validity. The function calculates the mean of the list of numbers through the minus operator (-) and the mean() method, resulting in a new array of the absolute differences between each element and the mean. Finally, it returns the mean of these absolute differences, which is the Mean Absolute Deviation of the provided list. 
The code offers an efficient approach to calculate MAD for a list of numbers. Using numpy enables vectorized operations, which enhances performance for large datasets and delivers a concise solution for this problem.
