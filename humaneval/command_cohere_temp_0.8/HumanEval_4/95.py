Here's a Python script that includes a function to calculate the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import unittest

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))

class TestMeanAbsoluteDeviation(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_mean_absolute_deviation_single_number(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0]), 0)

    def test_mean_absolute_deviation_list_of_two_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0]), 1.0)

    def test_mean_absolute_deviation_list_of_three_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]), 1.0)

    def test_mean_absolute_deviation_list_of_four_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]), 1.0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This script includes a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It uses the `numpy` library to operate on arrays and perform calculations. The function is then tested through a series of tests that validate its behavior for different scenarios. Finally, `unittest.main()` is invoked to discover and run all test cases.  This way, you can assure that the function behaves as expected. 

You can use this script as a base and modify it to suit your specific needs.
