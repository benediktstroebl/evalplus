Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you've outlined, along with a markdown code block showing the code and corresponding tests:
```python
# Ensure tests run with both Python 2 and Python 3:
from __future__ import print_function

import numpy as np
import unittest

from mean_absolute_deviation import mean_absolute_deviation #IMPORTANT! THIS LINE IMPORTsa THE FUNCTION WE ARE GOING TO DEFINE IN THE NEXT LINES

class TestMeanAbsoluteDeviation(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_mean_absolute_deviation(self):
        """ Test mean_absolute_deviation function runs without errors """
        numbers = [1., 2., 3., 4.]
        mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)

    def test_mean_absolute_deviation_diff(self):
        """ Test that the difference between each element and its mean is calculated correctly """
        numbers = [1., 2., 3., 4.]
        mean = np.mean(numbers)
        diffs = [ abs(x - mean) for x in numbers ]
        np.testing.assert_array_equal(diffs, mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
    1.0
    """
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    deviates = [ abs(x - mean) for x in numbers ]
    return np.mean(deviates)
```
In this code block:
1. We import the necessary modules, including `numpy` for numerical operations and `unittest` for writing tests.
2. We import the `mean_absolute_deviation` function from the corresponding module (ensure the function definition comes before this).
3. We define the `TestMeanAbsoluteDeviation` class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`, which allows us to create test methods for our function.
4. The `test_mean_absolute_deviation` function is used to verify if the function runs without errors. We pass a list of numbers, and the function under test is called with this list. 
5. The `test_mean_absolute_deviation_diff` function verifies the correct calculation of the absolute difference between each element and the mean. It creates the absolute differences and checks them against an expected `numpy.array` using `numpy.testing.assert_array_equal`. 

This code block shows how to create tests in Python, making the code robust and ensuring theMean Absolute Deviation function works properly. 
Remember to add the corresponding function definition in the appropriate module, ensuring it passes these tests. Huge payload of knowledge  ^_^.
