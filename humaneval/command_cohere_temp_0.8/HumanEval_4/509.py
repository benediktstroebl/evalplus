Here's a Python script that includes a function to calculate the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import unittest

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))

class TestMeanAbsoluteDeviation(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_basic(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([1., 2., 3., 4.]), 1.0)
    def test_ EmptyList(self):
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            mean_absolute_deviation([])
    def test_OnlyOneValue(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([10.0]), 0.0)
    def test_LargeData(self):
        self.assertAlmostEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 6., 7., 8., 9., 10.]), 2.5)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This script includes a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It uses the `numpy` library to perform the mean and absolute deviation calculations. 

The script also includes a set of unit tests that verify the correctness of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function. These tests cover different cases, including an empty list, a list with only one value, and lists of various sizes. 

The `unittest` module is used to define and run the tests. By executing `unittest.main()` at the end of the script, the tests are automatically run when the script is executed directly. 

The expected outcome of this script is that all tests pass, indicating that the `mean_absolute_deviation` function is working correctly.  If the code encounters a bug and causes one of the tests to fail, it will print out an error message describing the failure. 

Overall, this Python script provides an implementation of the mean absolute deviation calculator along with robust tests to ensure its correctness.  It is designed to help you easily integrate this functionality into your codebase or validate your own implementation.  In the end, it should pass all the tests, indicating that the function is working as expected.  If you encounter any issues, please revise your code and ensure it complies with the test instructions.
