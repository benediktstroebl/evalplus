Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script provides a function `mean_absolute_deviation()` that accepts a list of numbers and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in that list. It utilizes the NumPy library to provide efficient numerical operations, especially array operations. 
The Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) is calculated by subtracting the mean of the list from each number in the list, taking the absolute value of each difference, and then calculating the average of those absolute differences. This MAD value indicates the average deviation of the numbers from the mean of the list, providing a measure of the variability of the dataset.
