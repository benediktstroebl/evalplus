Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list. It uses the numpy library to handle numerical operations, and the `typing` module is used for type declarations.

The mean absolute deviation is a measure of the variability of a set of values. It is the average absolute difference between each element and the mean of the set. 

Here is an example of using this function:
```python
print(f"{mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])}")
```
The output will be:
```
1.0
```
This number indicates that the data point is closely clustered around the mean, which is ideal from a statistical perspective.
