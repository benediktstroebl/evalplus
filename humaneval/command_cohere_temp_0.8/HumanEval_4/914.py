Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
The function `mean_absolute_deviation` calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It utilizes the `numpy` library to operate on the input list as a one-dimensional array, computing the absolute differences between each element and the mean of the array, and then returns the mean of these absolute differences, providing a robust statistical metric for the dispersion of the data points with respect to their average. 
This approach takes advantage of numpy's efficient mathematical operations on arrays, ensuring faster and more concise code while maintaining the same functionality as the provided example.  feel free to adapt this code to your specific needs and integrate it into your codebase.
