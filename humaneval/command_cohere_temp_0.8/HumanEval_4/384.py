Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script uses the `numpy` library to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers. The `mean_absolute_deviation` function takes a list of floats as input and returns the MAD of the data. 

To calculate the MAD, the code follows these steps:
1. Imports: This block imports the necessary modules, including numpy for numerical operations and typing for type hints.
2. Function: The `mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:` function takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the mean absolute deviation. 
3. Numerical Operations: The function uses numpy to convert the input list to a numpy array, which allows for more efficient numerical operations. It then calculates the mean of the array and subtracts the mean from each number in the array.
4. Absolute Deviation: The code then calculates the absolute value of each difference, which gives the absolute deviation from the mean for each number.
5. Mean Absolute Deviation: Finally, the function returns the mean of these absolute deviations, which is the MAD of the dataset. 

This provides a simple and efficient approach to calculating the MAD in a single function, while still providing flexibility for different datasets.
