Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of calculating the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    :param numbers: List of input numbers
    :return: Mean Absolute Deviation
    """
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```

This script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and returns the mean absolute deviation of the list. 

The function first creates a NumPy array from the list of numbers. It then calculates the mean of the array and subtracts each element in the array from the mean to find the absolute deviation. Finally, it returns the mean of the absolute deviations.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))
```

And the output will be:
```bash
1.0
```

This value corresponds to the expected output in the original problem statement. 

This script provides a precise and efficient way to calculate the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. 

It utilizes the statistical and computational capabilities of NumPy to achieve this in a single line of code within the function. 

Additionally, it adheres to the principle of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) by using NumPy's capabilities rather than implementing the calculations manually. 
This makes the code more concise and manageable, improving maintainability and reducing the likelihood of errors in the long run. GPT-3 Embedder AI Modeling Platform by Cohereâ„¢
