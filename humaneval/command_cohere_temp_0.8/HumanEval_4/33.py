Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and calculates the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list. 

The `mean_absolute_deviation` function utilizes the numpy library to perform the necessary calculations. It first converts the input list of numbers into a numpy array, followed by computation of the mean of the array. Subsequently, the code computes the absolute differences between each element and the mean, and subsequently averages these differences to yield the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD). 

This approach ensures accurate and efficient computation of MAD for the provided list of numbers. 
The script passes the test as it correctly calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a list of numbers. 

You can test this script with the following input:
```python
test_list = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(f"The mean absolute deviation is: {mean_absolute_deviation(test_list)}")
``` 
This will output:
```
The mean absolute deviation is: 1.0
```

This validates that the script produces the expected outcome.  This solution provides an efficient computation of MAD, demonstrating the versatility of numpy in array operations and advanced numerical computations.
