Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you've described, along with a Markdown code block showing the code and corresponding tests:
```python
# Ensure tests are running on their own, and that the main code is not imported
from unittest.mock import patch

# Assuming you have a test file with test functions, e.g. test_mean_absolute_deviation.py
# This will mock the import statement in that test file, and allow running tests on this script
@patch('__main__.load_tests_for_ souvenier')
def main(*args, **kwargs):
    import unittest
    unittest.main(*args, **kwargs)

# The actual calculation of Mean Absolute Deviation
def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return sum(abs(x - sum(numbers) / len(numbers)) for x in numbers) / len(numbers)

# Example usage
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))  # Output: 1.0
```

The script includes a `mean_absolute_deviation` function that calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It does this by subtracting the mean of the numbers and taking the absolute value for each number in the list, then returning the average of those absolute values.

The script also uses the `unittest.mock` module to ensure that tests are run correctly, and the `main` function is not imported. It employs `patch` to mock the import statement in the test file, allowing tests to be run on this script. 

To use this script, ensure you place it in a Python file (e.g., `mean_absolute_deviation.py`), and execute it directly in your terminal.
