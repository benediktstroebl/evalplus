Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and calculates the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of the numbers in the list. 

The code first utilizes numpy to bring efficiency to the mean calculation and abs differences calculation by using `np.array(numbers)` to create a numpy array from the input list of numbers, achieved via `np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))`. This line calculates the absolute differences between each number in the list and the mean of the list, and then takes the mean of these absolute differences, returning the result as the final answer.

This approach guarantees accuracy and speed in taking on large datasets by leveraging efficient numpy operations.
