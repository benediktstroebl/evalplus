Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of calculating the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```

The function `mean_absolute_deviation` calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It first converts the input list to a NumPy array and calculates the mean of the array. Then, it subtracts the mean from each number in the array and calculates the absolute value to find the deviation from the mean for each number. Finally, it calculates the mean of these deviations to provide the mean absolute deviation of the input list.

The implementation leverages the numpy `abs` function and numpy array operations to achieve efficient computation, ensuring numerical stability.

This approach offers a concise solution that accurately calculates the mean absolute deviation, catering to a variety range of datasets through its utilization of numerical computing libraries.
