Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script utilizes the `numpy` library, which provides a vectorized solution and performs calculations efficiently. This not only improves the solution's efficiency but also simplifies the code, making it more readable.

Additionally, the `typing` module is used to establish the type of the input parameter, reinforcing the clarity of the code and aiding in concurrent type-checking.
