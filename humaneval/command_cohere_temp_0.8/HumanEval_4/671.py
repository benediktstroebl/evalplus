Here's a Python script that includes a function to calculate the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import unittest

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))

class TestMeanAbsoluteDeviation(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_basic(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([1., 2., 3., 4.]), 1.0)
    def test_ EmptyList(self):
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            mean_absolute_deviation([])
    def test_OnlyOneValue(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([10.0]), 0.0)
    def test_LargeData(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean_absolute_deviation([1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 6., 7., 8., 9., 10.]), 2.0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Let's break down the code:
1. We import  `List`  and  `numpy`  with their respective aliases, `np` for shorter reference in the code.
2. The `mean_absolute_deviation` function calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It converts the input list to a numpy array, calculates the mean of the array, and then calculates the absolute difference between each element of the array and the mean. Finally, it returns the mean of these absolute differences.
3. The `TestMeanAbsoluteDeviation` class defines four test methods to verify the behavior of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function. 

The `test_basic` method checks the basic functionality by comparing the result of the function with the expected value for a sample list of numbers.

The `test_EmptyList` method verifies that the function raises a  `ValueError`  when an empty list is passed as input, implying that the code follows the expected behavior.

The `test_OnlyValue` method tests the case where the list contains a single value, ensuring that the function returns 0, which is the correct outcome for this scenario.

The `test_LargeData` method examines the function with a larger dataset, ensuring its accuracy and correctness. 

Finally, `unittest.main()` is called to discover and run all the test methods defined within the module. 

This script provides a self-contained function that solves the problem and also includes corresponding tests to verify the functionality.  This will ensure that the function behaves as expected and aligns with the problem statement.
