Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. It utilizes the numpy library to operate on the input list, which is converted into a numpy array for efficient computation. The code employs numpy's mean function to calculate the mean of the absolute differences between each element and the mean of the dataset, yielding an accurate and efficient solution.
