Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of calculating the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    :param numbers: List of input numbers
    :return: Mean Absolute Deviation
    """
    # If the list is empty, return NaN
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        return np.nan
    
    # If there is only one element in the list, return 0
    if len(numbers) == 1:
        return 0.0
    
    # List of numbers
    x = np.array(numbers)
    
    # Mean of the input list
    x_mean = np.mean(x)
    
    # Calculate the absolute deviation from the mean for each number
    dev = np.abs(x - x_mean)
    
    # Return the Mean Absolute Deviation
    return np.mean(dev)
```

This script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes in a list of numbers and returns the mean absolute deviation of the list. The function first checks if the list is empty or contains only one element, in which case it returns NaN or 0, respectively. It then converts the list of numbers into a NumPy array and calculates the mean of the array. Then, it computes the absolute difference between each element of the array and the mean, and calculates the average of these absolute differences to return the mean absolute deviation of the provided list. 

To ensure robustness, the script utilizes typing to enforce type hints, and NumPy for numerical computations, enhancing efficiency and correctness.

This should provide a complete solution to the problem in a self-contained Python script. Let me know if there is anything else I can help you with!
