Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This script utilizes the `numpy` library, specifically the `np.mean`, `np.abs`, and `np.array` functions. The `mean_absolute_deviation` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list. It first converts the input list into a numpy array, then calculates the mean of the elements in the array. It then calculates the absolute difference between each element and the mean, and returns the average of these differences as the mean absolute deviation. 
This solution has a time complexity of `O(n)` and uses a space complexity of `O(1)`.
