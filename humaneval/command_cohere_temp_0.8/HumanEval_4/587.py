Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script utilizes the `numpy` library to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers. The `mean_absolute_deviation` function takes a list of floats as input and returns the MAD value. Here's a breakdown of the process:
1. The input list is converted into a numpy array, which allows for efficient mathematical operations.
2. The numpy `abs` function is used to calculate the absolute differences between each element of the array and the mean of the array.
3. The `mean` function is then applied to the resulting array of absolute differences to calculate the overall mean absolute deviation, which is returned as the final result.

This approach takes advantage of numpy's efficient numerical operations to compute the MAD value in an efficient and accurate manner. Note that while the script uses `numpy` for efficiency and accuracy, it is dependent on this library, and it is important to have it installed in your environment to use this solution. 
Here's an example of using this function:
```python
>>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
1.0
```
This demonstrates that the function correctly calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation of the input list, which in this case is [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], and the result is the expected value of 1.0.
