Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(np.array(numbers))))
```
This Python script uses the `numpy` library to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers. The function `mean_absolute_deviation` takes a list of floats as input and returns the MAD of the data. 

To compute the MAD, the following steps are performed:
1. The input list of numbers is converted to a NumPy array for efficient processing.
2. The NumPy array is used to calculate the mean of the data using the `np.mean` function.
3. The code then calculates the absolute differences between each element and the mean obtained above.
4. Lastly, the mean of these absolute differences is computed to provide the MAD value.

Note: Ensure you have the `numpy` library installed to run this script, which you can do by executing `pip install numpy`.
