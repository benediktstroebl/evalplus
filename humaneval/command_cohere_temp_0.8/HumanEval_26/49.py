```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return list(set(numbers))
```
This Python script provides a function called `remove_duplicates`, which takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of unique integers from the input list, maintaining the original order of those unique elements. The function uses a set to efficiently remove duplicates, ensuring that no element occurs more than once in the output list. 
The function is self-contained and can be used directly to remove duplicates from a list of integers, as demonstrated in the provided example. This solution is also efficient with time and space complexity of O(n log(n)) due to the use of set computation. 
This approach ensures that the code is modular, readable, and optimized, making it a valuable tool for solving this specific problem and potentially integrating it into broader applications that require efficient removal of duplicates from lists. 

Here is a sample output of the function:
```
remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
[1, 3, 4]
```

This demonstrates the function removing duplicates, keeping the remaining elements in their original order from the input list.
