```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    seen = set()
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num not in seen or len(seen) == 1:
            result.append(num)
            seen.add(num)
    return result
```

The `remove_duplicates` function uses a set, `seen`, to efficiently track encountered integers and their frequencies. It iterates through the input `numbers`, adding only unique elements to the `result` list and leaving duplicates out. This ensures the problem's requirement of maintaining element order while removing duplicates is fulfilled.
