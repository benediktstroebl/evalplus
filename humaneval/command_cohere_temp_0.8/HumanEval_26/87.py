```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return list(set(numbers))
```
This Python script provides a function called `remove_duplicates`, which takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of unique integers from the input list, maintaining their original order. The function uses a set to store only the unique integers from the input list, ensuring that any duplicate entries are automatically removed. The returned list of unique integers retains the original order of the first occurrence of each number in the input list. 
The function is self-contained and does not rely on any external variables or contexts. It is also succinct and straightforward, using a set to solve the problem efficiently. This solution is well-suited to handle various scenarios where you need to remove duplicate integers from a list while preserving the order of unique elements. 
You can use it in your code to solve problems that involve removing duplicates from a list in a simple and effective way. 
The solution is also extensible and can be easily adapted to handle more complex use cases if needed.
