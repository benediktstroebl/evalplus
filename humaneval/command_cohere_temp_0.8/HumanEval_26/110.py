```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    seen = set()
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num not in seen or len(seen) == 1:
            result.append(num)
            seen.add(num)
    return result
```

The algorithm is a typical set of iterations to remove duplicates:
1. A variable `seen` is used as a collection to track seen integers. It is initially initialized as a `set` to guarantee the order of elements is not preserved. 
2. The `result` variable is a list that will eventually store the integers without duplicates.
3. Go through each integer in `numbers`. If the integer is not in the `seen` collection or if the size of the `seen` collection is one (i.e., there is only one occurrence of the integer), append it to the `result` list and add it to the `seen` collection.
4. Return the `result` list when the loop is finished, giving a list of integers, no duplicates.

This algorithm effectively removes duplicates, fulfills the requirement of maintaining order, and achieves it with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list.
