```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return list(set(numbers))
```

This well-optimized function uses a set, which is a built-in data structure designed to efficiently handle unique elements, to automatically remove duplicate integers from the given list. The function then converts the set back to a list to maintain the original order of the unique elements. 

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]
result = remove_duplicates(numbers)
print(result)
```
This code will print out the following:
```
[1, 3, 4]
```

The function can also be used in a larger code base to remove duplicates from an list of integers in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input list. 

This solution is also applicable in scenarios beyond this specific problem, as it can be used to remove duplicates from lists of any hashable objects, providing it flexibility across various data types.
