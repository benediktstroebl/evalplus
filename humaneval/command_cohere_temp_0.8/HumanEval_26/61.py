```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    seen = set()
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num not in seen or len(seen) == 1:
            result.append(num)
            seen.add(num)
    return result
```

The approach used in the function `remove_duplicates` is to iterate over the input list `numbers` and maintain a `set` called `seen` to keep track of unique elements. For each number in the list, it checks if it has been previously seen (`seen` set has it as a unique element). If the condition is true or the set has only one element, it adds the number to the `result` list and updates the `seen` set. This way, it ensures that duplicate elements are removed while keeping the order of unique elements intact. 

To test this function, you can use the following sample input and expected output:
```python
>>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
[1, 3, 4]
>>> remove_duplicates([0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5])
[0, 1, 2, 3, 5]
``` 

You can also verify the functionality with a simple `unittest` module:
```python
import unittest

from remove_duplicates import remove_duplicates

class TestRemoveDuplicates(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_remove_duplicates(self):
        self.assertEqual(remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4]), [1, 3, 4])

    def test_remove_duplicates_multiple_occurrences(self):
        self.assertEqual(remove_duplicates([0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]), [0, 1, 2, 3, 5])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This script will test the `remove_duplicates` function with two different scenarios to verify its functionality.  The `unittest` module is used to define test cases. For each test case, the `assertEqual` method checks that the output from the function is as expected. If the condition passes, the test case is successful. If not, the `unittest` module throws an error and provides detailed information about the failure, helping to identify any issues and fix them.
