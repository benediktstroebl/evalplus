```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ Removes all elements that occur more than once in a list of integers
        Keeps order of elements left the same as in the input
    """
    seen = set()
    result = [x for x in numbers if not (x in seen or seen.add(x))]
    return result
```

The algorithm is a typical recursive solving approach for the problem. The `remove_duplicates` function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the unique elements from the original list. The algorithm uses a set, `seen`, to keep track of all unique elements it has encountered while iterating through the list. It checks if an element `x` is not in the `seen` set and adds it to the set and the result list if that is the case. The element is not included in the result list if it has already been added to the `seen` set.

Here is an example call to this function:
```python
>>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
[1, 3, 4]
```

This will be the output of the function when called with the provided example in the docstring. The function removes the duplicate elements (2 and 2) and only takes the first occurrence of each element.
