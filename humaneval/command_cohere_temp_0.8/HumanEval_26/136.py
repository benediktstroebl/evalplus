```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return list(set(numbers))
```
This Python script provides a function called `remove_duplicates`, which takes a list of integers (`numbers`) as input. It uses a set to eliminate duplicate elements from the input list and returns the unique elements as a new list. This function ensures that elements occurring more than once in the input list are removed, while preserving the original order of the remaining elements. 
The function is self-contained, meaning it can be run standalone, and the code within it handles the complete processing of the task without relying on external variables or assumptions. 
It is also type-aware, thanks to the `from typing import List` declaration, which gives a clear indication of the expected input type, lending it some robustness and usability benefits. In addition, the function utilizes the `set` data structure to efficiently identify and remove duplicates, providing a concise and efficient solution. 
This approach ensures that each element in the resulting list occurs exactly once, maintaining the original order from the input list. 
If needed, the function can be effortlessly incorporated into other Python projects or JupyterNotebooks to solve similar tasks involving removal of duplicates from lists. The function's straightforward behavior and predictable interface make it accessible to both novice and experienced programmers for a variety of use cases involving data cleaning and deduplication. 
Overall, this code contributes a useful tool in managing lists of integers and could serve as a foundation for more sophisticated data processing routines.
