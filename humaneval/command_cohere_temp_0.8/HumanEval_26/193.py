```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return list(set(numbers))
```
This Python script provides a function called `remove_duplicates`, which takes a list of integers (`List[int]`) as input. Inside the function, it employs a set, which naturally eliminates duplicate elements, to process the input list. The function then returns a newly created list containing only the unique integers from the original input list, without any duplicates. This method ensures that elements appear only once in the output list, maintaining the order of their occurrence, as specified in the problem statement. 
The function is self-contained, meaning it does not rely on any external variables or contexts, and can be invoked and utilized independently. It is also type-aware, thanks to the `from typing import List` declaration, this characteristic enables developers to express the expected input and return types, fostering improved code readability and maintainability, particularly when working with lists of integers. 
This function is a straightforward and efficient solution to remove duplicates from a list of integers and retains the order of unique elements. 
The `remove_duplicates` function can be applied to solve the problem stated in the given Markdown code block, as it directly addresses the issue of removing duplicates while preserving the order of unique elements in the list. 
This code can be imported and utilized as a module in other Python scripts that require removing duplicates from lists. 
It's also important to note that there are alternate ways to solve this problem, such as using other data structures like dictionaries or ordered dictionaries, but the use of sets provides a concise and efficient solution without the need for additional data structure overhead.
