```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ Removes duplicates from a list of integers and returns the unique list in the same order as input. """
    seen = set()
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num not in seen:
            seen.add(num)
            result.append(num)
    return result
```

This Python script defines a function called `remove_duplicates` that takes a list of integers as input. It removes duplicate elements from the input list while preserving the original order of the remaining elements. Here's a brief explanation of how the function works:
1. The function utilizes Python's `typing` module to indicate that the `numbers` parameter is a list of integers.
2. A set called `seen` is initialized. Sets are used in Python to store unique values, and they have an efficient `O(1)` `O(1)` membership test, which makes them perfect for checking whether an element has already been seen.
3. A new list called `result` is created to store the unique integers, and it is initialized with no elements.
4. The function iterates through each integer in the input `numbers` list.
5. For each integer, it checks if the integer is already in the `seen` set. If it is not, it adds the integer to the `seen` set and appends it to the `result` list.
6. Finally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains only the unique integers from the original input list, retaining the original order. 

The function is designed to efficiently remove duplicates and maintain the order of elements.
