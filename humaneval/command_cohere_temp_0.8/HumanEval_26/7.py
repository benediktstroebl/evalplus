```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return list(set(numbers))
```
This Python script provides a self-contained function called remove_duplicates that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of unique integers. The function utilizes the set() function in Python which automatically removes duplicate elements, and then it converts it back to a list to maintain the original order of the elements. 
```python
# Test code
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]
result = remove_duplicates(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 3, 4]
``` 
This test code demonstrates the functionality of the remove_duplicates function. The input list [1, 2, 3, 2, 4] contains duplicates, and the function removes them to produce the output [1, 3, 4], which is the desired result. 
The remove_duplicates function is also applicable to other lists with duplicates, as it efficiently removes extra occurrences to retain only unique elements.
