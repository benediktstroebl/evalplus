```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    seen = set()
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num not in seen or len(seen) == 1:
            result.append(num)
            seen.add(num)
    return result
```

The remove_duplicates function uses a set, seen, to track encountered integers and a list, result, to store unique integers in the order they appear in the input. It iterates through the input list, checking if each integer is already in the seen set. If it's not found or if it's the first occurrence of any integer, it adds the integer to both the result and seen sets. The final result is returned as a list of unique integers, in the order they appeared in the input. 

To follow the specification, the function does not use the set default parameter initialization of seen set with {} as it would cause all elements to be considered as first occurrences and hence break the correctness of the algorithm. 

To further clarify the purpose and usage of the seen set, it's important to note that sets in Python are mutable and automatically update their membership states when elements are added or deleted. Therefore, using set(seen) would create a new independent set instance, causing the state of seen to be lost during the iteration, thereby breaking the algorithm.
