```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ Removes duplicates from a list of integers and returns the unique list in the same order as input. """
    seen = set()
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num not in seen and not seen.add(num):
            result.append(num)
    return result
```

This removes duplicates from `numbers` and returns a list that is a subset of `numbers` with no duplicates. 

The algorithm works by initializing an empty set called `seen` to keep track of already-seen integers. We then iterate through each integer in `numbers`. For each integer, if it has not already appeared in `seen`, we add it to both the set (to confirm it is seen) and the `result` list. This ensures that each integer appears in `result` exactly once, in the same order as in the original list, as desired. 

Such an approach is an example of a typical algorithm to achieve this, named 'Set Compression': 
1. Create a set to hold unique values from the list.
2. Iterate through the list only once, adding values to the set.
3. Return the set as the result. 
Note: Using a set instead of a list for `seen` improves the efficiency of the algorithm as it takes constant time (O(1)) to check for membership in a set, compared to O(n) in a list, where n is the number of elements. Thus, it makes the algorithm more efficient and suitable for larger lists of integers. It also maintains the insertion order of elements in the set, satisfying the constraint of keeping the order of elements unchanged in the output list.
