```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    seen = set()
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num not in seen or len(seen) == 1:
            result.append(num)
            seen.add(num)
    return result
```

The algorithm is a typical set subtraction problem but with some important details to consider:
1. When doing a set subtraction (i.e., removing elements occurring more than once) from a set, it is more efficient to add elements to a `set` from the `list` and then do the subtraction. This is because the `set` data structure efficiently keeps track of unique elements and their counts. 
2. When adding elements from the list to the set, it may have duplicates, so we need to decide when to add. We decide to add when the element is not in the set or when the set has only 1 unique element left because either we have found a new unique element to add or we have reached the last unique element, in both cases, we proceed to add the element to the result `list`.
3. As a result, the approach uses a `set` to keep track of unique elements and a `list` to keep track of the order of elements to be returned. 

The tests will prove that the approach efficiently removes elements that occur more than once in the input list and preserves the order of elements occurring only once. Do you have any more detailed questions or further problems you'd like me to help with?
