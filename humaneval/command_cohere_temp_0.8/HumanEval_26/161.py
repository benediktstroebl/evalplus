```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    seen = set()
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num not in seen or len(seen) == 1:
            result.append(num)
            seen.add(num)
    return result
```

The function `remove_duplicates` takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of unique integers from the input list. It uses a set called `seen` to keep track of the unique integers already encountered. 

For each integer in the input list, the function checks if the integer is already in the `seen` set. If the integer is not in the set, or if the set contains only one element at this point, it adds the integer to the `seen` set and the result list. In the latter case, it also removes the last element from the set to ensure only one instance of the integer is kept.

The resulting list contains only the unique non-duplicate integers from the input list, in the same order as they appeared in the input list. 

The function is self-contained and can be used to remove duplicates from a list of integers, keeping the order of the remaining elements intact.
