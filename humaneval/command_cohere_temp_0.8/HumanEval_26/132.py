```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return list(set(numbers))
```
This Python script provides a function called `remove_duplicates`, which takes a list of integers (`numbers`) as input. It uses a set to eliminate duplicate elements from the input list and returns the unique elements as a new list. This is a common technique for removing duplicates, as sets inherently discard duplicate values, and the list comprehension `list(set(numbers))` converts the set back into a list for convenient retrieval. 

The function's type hinting via `from typing import List` indicates that the function expects a list of integers and will return a list of integers. 

This solution is both efficient and concise, demonstrating a practical application of set operations in Python for handling list uniqueness.
