```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    seen = set()
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num not in seen or len(seen) == 1:
            result.append(num)
            seen.add(num)
    return result
```

The function `remove_duplicates` removes elements that occur more than once in a list of integers, while preserving the order of the remaining elements. It does so by utilizing a set, `seen`, to keep track of elements that have already been encountered. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:
1. At the beginning of the function, a set named `seen` is initialized. This set will store unique elements as they are encountered in the list. 
2. Similarly, a blank list named `result` is initiated to store the resultant unique elements. 
3. The function iterates through each element in the provided list of integers. 
4. For each integer (`num`), the function checks whether it is already present in the `seen` set. If it is not found in the set, it is added to both the `seen` set and the `result` list. This ensures that the element is added to the result list on its first occurrence. 
5. However, if the integer `num` is already present in the `seen` set, the function only adds it to the `result` list if the size of the `seen` set is equal to 1. This condition ensures that the element is only added to the result list the first time it occurs and not on subsequent occurrences. 

By following these steps, the function `remove_duplicates` effectively removes all elements that occur more than once in the input list while maintaining the order of the remaining elements. 

You can verify the function's correctness by testing it against the provided example in the markdown code block or any other set of integers where duplicates need to be removed.
