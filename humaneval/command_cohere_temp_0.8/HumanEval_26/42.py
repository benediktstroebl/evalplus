```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    seen = set()
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num not in seen or len(seen) == 1:
            result.append(num)
            seen.add(num)
    return result
```

The given Python script provides a solution to the problem statement by removing duplicate elements from a given list of integers while preserving the order of those elements that remain. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:
1. **Importing the Required Module**: The code starts by importing the `List` module from the `typing` module. This is a new requirement introduced in Python 3.8 and above, and it allows you to declare the type of a variable as a list of a specific content type (in this case, integers).
2. **Defining the `remove_duplicates` Function**: The script defines a function named `remove_duplicates` that takes a single argument called `numbers`, which is a list of integers. The function returns a new list that contains only the unique elements from the input list.
3. **Using a Set to Track Unique Elements**: To keep track of unique elements, the function creates a set called `seen`. Sets are used because they inherently do not allow duplicate values, so any element added to a set is automatically unique.
4. **Building the Result List**: The function then iterates through each element in the input `numbers` list. For each element `num`, it checks whether it's not already present in the `seen` set, or if it's the first occurrence of that element in the set (this is checked by the condition `len(seen) == 1`). If either of these conditions is true, the element is added to the `result` list, and then it's also added to the `seen` set.
5. **Return the Result**: Once the loop is finished processing all elements in the input list, the function returns the `result` list, which contains only the unique elements from the original input list.

This approach ensures that duplicate elements are removed from the list while preserving the order of the remaining elements. The condition to check if it's the first occurrence of an element is added to ensure that if there's only one occurrence of an element, it will be included in the result list.
