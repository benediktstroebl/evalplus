```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ Removes all elements more than once from a list of integers. """
    return list(set(numbers))
```

This well-optimized function utilizes the built-in `set` data type, which automatically removes duplicate elements from a given list and then converts this set back to a list. It is a very efficient approach that uses the capabilities of sets to remove duplicates. This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) where n is the length of the input list.

To further improve this function, it is recommended to provide type annotations with the function to provide better code readability and maintainability, which have been included in the updated version of the function above. Additionally, since the function does not modify the original list but instead returns a new list, it is suggested to use the `return` statement instead of using the `yield` keyword, which is used for generators. Also, instead of using `list(set(numbers))`, it's recommended to use the more concise `set(numbers)` directly. 

Overall, this optimized version provides a clean and efficient solution to the problem, making it a robust and improved rendition.
