```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ Removes duplicates from a list of integers and returns the unique list in the same order as input. """
    seen = set()
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num not in seen:
            seen.add(num)
            result.append(num)
    return result
```

This Python script defines a function called `remove_duplicates` that takes a list of integers as input. It removes duplicate elements from the input list while preserving the original order of the remaining elements. Here's how the function works:
1. It imports the `List` module from the `typing` module to enable type hints.
2. The function starts with a docstring that describes its purpose and behavior.
3. Inside the function, a set called `seen` is initialized. This set will be used to keep track of encountered unique integers.
4. It initializes an empty list called `result` to store the unique integers after removing duplicates.
5. The function iterates through each element in the input `numbers` list.
6. For each element `num`, it checks if the element is already present in the `seen` set. If it's not present, it means the element is unique, so it adds it to both the `seen` set and the `result` list.
7. The function returns the `result` list containing only the unique integers from the input list, preserving the original order. 

The expected output from the example in the docstring is: `[1, 3, 4]`
