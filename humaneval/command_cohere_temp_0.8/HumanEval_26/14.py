```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    seen = set()
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num not in seen or len(seen) == 1:
            result.append(num)
            seen.add(num)
    return result
```

The approach used is a combination of a loop and a set. The code iterates through each number in the list and uses the set to keep track of unique elements, marking them as seen. If a number is already in the set and it's the only element in it, which means it's the last occurrence of this number, the code skips it. This guarantees the preservation of order while removing duplicates. 

The specification regarding keeping the order of elements is an essential aspect of this problem. It implies that sorting the list or using more advanced data structures like sets exclusively may break the requirement for maintaining the original order. Thus, the given approach using a combination of a list and a set is a more appropriate solution.  This method efficiently removes duplicates while retaining the order of unique elements.  It also ensures that numbers are processed in their occurrence order, as specified in the problem.  This concise and efficient approach ensures the functionality, robustness, and readability, making it ideal for this problem.  Any changes to this would potentially require changing the specification to match the new approach.  This solution provides the best balance between speed and simplicity, making it optimal.
