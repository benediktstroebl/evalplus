```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return list(dict.fromkeys(numbers))
```
This code uses the `dict.fromkeys` method to create a dictionary from the list of integers, deleting all keys that appear more than once and converting the dictionary back to a list. This ensures that no duplicates are retained, and the order of the remaining elements is preserved. 
The function is self-contained and can be used in other scripts to remove duplicates from a list of integers while maintaining order. 
It is important to note that this solution assumes that the input list contains only integers. If the list contains other types of objects, the function may not work as expected, and validation may be necessary. In layman's terms, the function takes a list of numbers, transforms it into a dictionary, and then deletes any keys (numbers) that appear more than once. Finally, it converts the dictionary back to a list, resulting in a unique set of numbers in their original order.
