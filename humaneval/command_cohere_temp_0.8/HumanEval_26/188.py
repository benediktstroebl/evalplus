```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return list(set(numbers))
```

This well-optimized code uses a set, which is an immutable collection, to remove duplicates from the list. This removes the need for multiple list operations, making the code more efficient in terms of time complexity. Furthermore, using the `set` function simplifies the process by automatically removing duplicate elements, making the code more concise and easier to comprehend.

To test this function, you can create a test list and assert that the output contains the expected results:
```python
# Test the given function by checking its behavior on a specific input list
assert remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4]) == [1, 3, 4]
``` 

This approach provides a more concise and efficient solution to the problem, making it a reliable go-to option for removing duplicates from lists.
