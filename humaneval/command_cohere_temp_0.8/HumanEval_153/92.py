```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, found = 0, -1
    for i, ext in enumerate(extensions):
        cap = sum(c.isupper() for c in ext)
        sm = sum(c.islower() for c in ext)
        strength = cap - sm
        if strength > strongest:
            strongest, found = strength, i
    return f'{class_name}.{extensions[found]}'
```

The function iterates through the list of extensions, calculating the strength of each extension as the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in the extension name. If the calculated strength is greater than the current strongest strength, the strongest strength and the index of the corresponding extension are updated.

In case of a tie between multiple extensions with the highest strength, the function returns the extension that appears first in the list. The function returns the class name combined with the strongest extension name.

The expected output for the provided example in the prompt would be:
`Slices.SErviNGSliCes` 

This solution adheres to the problem's requirements in terms of selecting the strongest extension and handling ties by prioritizing the first occurrence of an equally strong extension.
