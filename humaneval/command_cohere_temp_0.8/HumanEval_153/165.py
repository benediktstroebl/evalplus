```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strongest_name = -1, ''
    for e in extensions:
        cap = sum(1 for c in e if c.isupper())
        sm = sum(1 for c in e if c.islower())
        strength = cap - sm
        if strength > strongest:
            strongest, strongest_name = strength, e
    return f'{class_name}.{strongest_name}'
```

The script uses a simple loop to iterate through the list of extensions, calculating the strength of each extension as the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters. The strongest extension is selected based on this strength value, and the function returns the corresponding class name with the strongest extension appended. If there are multiple extensions with the same strength, the function selects the one that appears first in the list. This approach ensures correctness and efficiency in finding the strongest extension for the provided class name and list of extensions.
