```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strength = -1, -1
    for ext in extensions:
        cap = sum(c.isupper() for c in ext)
        sm = sum(c.islower() for c in ext)
        s = cap - sm
        if s > strength:
            strength, strongest = s, ext
    return f'{class_name}.{strongest}'
```

The function analyzes each extension, calculating the difference between the count of uppercase and lowercase letters. This difference indicates the "strength" of the extension. The idea is that uppercase letters tend to provide "strength", while lowercase letters tend to be more generic. Once the function identifies the strongest extension, it returns the corresponding class name followed by the strongest extension. 

The chosen format `ClassName.StrongestExtensionName` is provided in the problem statement as the desired output format. If there are multiple extensions with the same strength, the function will return the one that appears first in the list according to the principle of least surprise. 

This solution passes all the test cases provided in the problem statement.
