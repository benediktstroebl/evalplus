```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, found = 0, -1
    for i, ext in enumerate(extensions):
        cap = sum(c.isupper() for c in ext)
        sm = sum(c.islower() for c in ext)
        strength = cap - sm
        if strength > strongest:
            strongest, found = strength, i
    return f'{class_name}.{extensions[found]}'
```

The function iterates through the list of extensions, calculating the strength of each extension as the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in the extension name. If the calculated strength is higher than the current strongest strength, the strongest strength and the index of the corresponding extension are updated. Finally, the function returns the strongest extension name concatenated with the class name.

The solution effectively handles cases where multiple extensions have the same strength, as it relies on the order in the input list to determine the strongest extension.

The `Strongest_Extension` function solves the problem as described in the prompt and produces the expected output for the example provided. It can be used as a self-contained solution for the problem in Python.
