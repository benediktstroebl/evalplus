```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strongest_name = -1, ""
    for name in extensions:
        cap = sum(1 for c in name if c.isupper())
        sm = sum(1 for c in name if c.islower())
        strength = cap - sm
        if strength > strongest:
            strongest, strongest_name = strength, name
    return f"{class_name}.{strongest_name}"
```

The function analyzes each extension, calculating the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters. The strength of the extension is this difference, with a larger value indicating higher strength. The function records the name of the strongest extension and its strength. In cases of equal strength, the first extension encountered is selected. The function then returns the class name combined with the strongest extension name, formatted as `'ClassName.StrongestExtensionName'`. 

The solution is optimized to efficiently calculate the strength of each extension using sum functions tailored for uppercase and lowercase letter counting. This improves the efficiency of the process compared to iterating over the characters and manually counting.
