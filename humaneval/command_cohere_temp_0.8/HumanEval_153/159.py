```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strongest_index = 0, 0
    for i, ext in enumerate(extensions):
        cap = sum(c.isupper() for c in ext)
        sm = sum(c.islower() for c in ext)
        strength = cap - sm
        if strength > strongest:
            strongest, strongest_index = strength, i
    return f'{class_name}.{extensions[strongest_index]}'
```

The function calculates the strength of each extension as the difference between uppercase and lowercase letters in the extension name. The strongest extension is selected and its index is returned. If there are extensions with the same strength, the first one is selected. The solution is encapsulated in the `Strongest_Extension` function and can be used directly to solve the problem.
