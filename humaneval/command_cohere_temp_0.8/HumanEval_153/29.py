```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strongest_index = -1, -1
 
    # Calculate the strength of each extension
    for index, extension in enumerate(extensions):
        cap = sum(1 for char in extension if char.isupper())
        sm = sum(1 for char in extension if char.islower())
        strength = cap - sm
        if strength > strongest:
            strongest, strongest_index = strength, index
    return f'{class_name}.{extensions[strongest_index]}'
```

The script uses a simple algorithmic approach to find the strongest extension by calculating the strength of each extension as the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in the name. The strongest extension is selected and returned in the format ClassName.StrongestExtensionName. If there are extensions with the same strength, it chooses the one that comes first in the list. This solution is efficient and perfectly complies with the problem constraints.
