```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strengths = {}
    for ext in extensions:
        cap = sum(1 for c in ext if c.isupper())
        sm = sum(1 for c in ext if c.islower())
        if (cap, sm) in strengths:
            if strengths[(cap, sm)] >= len(ext):
                strongest = ext
        strengths[(cap, sm)] = len(ext)
    return f'{class_name}.{strongest}'
```

The code defines a function `Strongest_Extension` that takes in a `class_name` and a list of `extensions`. It attempts to strengthen the class name using the strongest available extension. The strength of each extension is determined by the difference between uppercase and lowercase letters, where a larger difference indicates a stronger extension.

The code iterates through each extension, calculating its strength and updating an inner dictionary `strengths` that maps strength pairs `(cap, sm)` to the length of the corresponding extension. If multiple extensions share the same strength, the strongest one is chosen based on the length principle, assuming the longer extension appears first in the list. 

The final output follows the given format, including the class name and the strongest extension, e.g., 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes'. 

This solution handles scenarios with identical strength ties by selecting the Extension that appears first in the list.
