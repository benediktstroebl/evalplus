```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strongest_name = -1, ''
    for e in extensions:
        cap = sum(1 for c in e if c.isupper())
        sm = sum(1 for c in e if c.islower())
        strength = cap - sm
        if strength > strongest:
            strongest, strongest_name = strength, e
    return f'{class_name}.{strongest_name}'
```

The function analyzes each extension, calculating the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters. The strength of the extension is this difference, with a negative value indicating more uppercase letters. The strongest extension is chosen and returned in the format `ClassName.StrongestExtensionName` with the strongest extension name. In case of a tie, the first extension in the list is favored. 

The solution is self-contained and efficient, solving the problem statement in a single function, and it can be copied and run independently. It relies solely on standard library features and Python's str.isalnum() function and doesn't require external dependencies.
