```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strongest_index = 0, 0
    for i, ext in enumerate(extensions):
        cap = sum(c.isupper() for c in ext)
        sm = sum(c.islower() for c in ext)
        strength = cap - sm
        if strength > strongest:
            strongest, strongest_index = strength, i
    return f'{class_name}.{extensions[strongest_index]}'
```

The function analyzes each extension, calculating the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters. The strongest extension is determined by this difference, and in cases of ties, the extension's sequence in the list dictates the selection. The function returns the class name combined with the strongest extension name.

Here is an example call for the function:
```python
print(Strongest_Extension("Slices", ["SERviNGSliCes", "Cheese", "Stuffed"]))
```
The output will be:
```
Slices.SERviNGSliCes
``` 

This is in response to the problem statement, where based on the given rules, the "SERviNGSliCes" extension is the strongest among the provided list.
