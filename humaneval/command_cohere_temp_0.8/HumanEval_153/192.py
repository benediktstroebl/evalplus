```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strength = -1, -1
    for e in extensions:
        cap = sum(1 for c in e if c.isupper())
        sm = sum(1 for c in e if c.islower())
        s = cap - sm
        if s > strength:
            strength, strongest = s, e
    return f'{class_name}.{strongest}'
```

The function calculates the difference between the count of uppercase and lowercase letters to determine the strength of each extension. The strongest extension with the highest strength is selected and returned in the format `ClassName.StrongestExtensionName` after iterating through all possibilities. If there are multiple extensions with the same strength, the first one encountered in the list is selected.

This approach is efficient and has a time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the `extensions` list.
