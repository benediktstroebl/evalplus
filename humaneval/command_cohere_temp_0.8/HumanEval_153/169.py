```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strongest_index = -1, -1
 
    # Calculate the strength of each extension
    for index, extension in enumerate(extensions):
        cap_count = sum(char.isupper() for char in extension)
        sm_count = sum(char.islower() for char in extension)
        strength = cap_count - sm_count
        if strength > strongest:
            strongest, strongest_index = strength, index
    return f'{class_name}.{extensions[strongest_index]}'
```

The function calculates the strength of each extension by counting the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in each extension name. The difference between these counts represents the strength of each extension, with a positive value indicating a stronger extension. The function then returns the class name combined with the name of the strongest extension. If multiple extensions have the same strength, the function will return the one that appears first in the list. 

Let's break down the code:
1. `strongest`, `strongest_index = -1, -1`: These variables are initialized to track the index of the strongest extension so far. `strongest` is set to -1 initially to ensure the strength of the first extension is stronger than the initial value. `strongest_index` is set to -1 because the initial extension is not yet known.
2. `for index, extension in enumerate(extensions):`: This loop iterates over each extension in the `extensions` list. The `enumerate` function provides both the index and value of each item in the list.
3. `cap_count = sum(char.isupper() for char in extension)`: This calculates the number of uppercase letters in the current extension. The `sum` function iterates over each character in the `extension` string and counts the number of uppercase letters.
4. `sm_count = sum(char.islower() for char in extension)`: Similar to the above, this calculates the number of lowercase letters in the current extension.
5. `strength = cap_count - sm_count`: This calculates the strength of the current extension, which is the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters. A positive value indicates a stronger extension.
6. `if strength > strongest:`: This condition checks if the current extension has greater strength than the strongest extension found so far. If so, it updates the `strongest` and `strongest_index` to the current extension and its index.
7. The final `return` statement combines the class name with the name of the strongest extension and returns the result. 

Please note that the solution assumes that the input parameters `class_name` and `extensions` are already validated and appropriate. It assumes the list of extensions is non-empty and that the class name is a string. Additional preprocessing or validation steps may be necessary, depending on the context of the problem and the input data.
