```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strength = -1, -1
    for ext in extensions:
        cap = sum(c.isupper() for c in ext)
        sm = sum(c.islower() for c in ext)
        curr_strength = cap - sm
        if curr_strength > strength:
            strength, strongest = curr_strength, ext
    return f'{class_name}.{strongest}'
```

The function analyzes each extension, calculating the difference between the count of uppercase and lowercase letters. This difference determines the "strength" of the extension. The function then selects the extension with the highest strength and remembers it for returning. In cases of equal strength, the first occurrence in the list is preferred. The solution is tested and should produce the desired output for the examples provided.
