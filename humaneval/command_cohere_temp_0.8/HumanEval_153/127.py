```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strength = None, -1
    for ext in extensions:
        cap = sum(1 for c in ext if c.isupper())
        sm = sum(1 for c in ext if c.islower())
        cur_strength = cap - sm
        if cur_strength > strength:
            strength, strongest = cur_strength, ext
    return f'{class_name}.{strongest}'
```

The function rolls through the list of extensions, calculating the strength of each extension as the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters. If the calculated strength is greater than the current strongest extension, the strongest extension and its strength are updated.

The `f'{class_name}.{strongest}'` statement constructs a string that joins the class name and the strongest extension with a dot in between, as specified in the problem statement. 

This solution follows the problem's guidelines in selecting the strongest extension and utilizes a concise and efficient for loop for ext in extensions: statement to cycle through the list of extensions, eliminating the need for any additional loops. 

Note: The solution assumes that the list `extensions` input is valid and that all necessary extensions are present.  If these assumptions are not met, the function may not return the expected results.  As always, it is important to thoroughly test any input validation and handling functions to ensure they handle all possible scenarios and edge cases.
