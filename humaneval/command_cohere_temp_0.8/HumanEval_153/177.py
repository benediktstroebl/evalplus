```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strongest_name = -1, ""
    for e in extensions:
        cap = sum(1 for c in e if c.isupper())
        sm = sum(1 for c in e if c.islower())
        strength = cap - sm
        if strength > strongest:
            strongest, strongest_name = strength, e
    return f"{class_name}.{strongest_name}"
```

The function uses two variables, `strongest` and `strongest_name`, which are initialized to `-1 and an empty string`, respectively. It then iterates through the list of extensions, calculating the strength of each extension as the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters it contains. If the strength is greater than the current strongest extension, the `strongest` and `strongest_name` variables are updated.

After iterating through all the extensions, the function returns the formatted string containing the class name and the strongest extension name.

This solution assumes that the list of extensions passed to the function is not empty, and it behaves accordingly. Adjustments might be necessary for handling scenarios where the input list is empty or consists of only one extension, providing more robustness in edge cases. 

The code is concise and relatively easy to understand. It leverages basic operations on strings and numerical calculations to determine the strength of each extension, ultimately leading to an efficient and working solution.
