```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strength = -1, -1
    for e in extensions:
        cap = sum(1 for c in e if c.isupper())
        sm = sum(1 for c in e if c.islower())
        s = cap - sm
        if s > strength:
            strength, strongest = s, e
    return f'{class_name}.{strongest}'
```

The function analyzes each extension, calculating the difference between the count of uppercase and lowercase letters. This difference determines the "strength" of the extension. The code then selects the extension with the highest strength and retains the first occurrence of it in the list using the `strongest` variable. If there are ties, the first occurrence is selected. The function returns the result in the format `ClassName.StrongestExtensionName`. 

The strength metric is a simplification of the general idea that a longer extension is preferable, and an extension with more uppercase letters is likelier to be purposeful and less redundant, but it's not a perfect reflector of these qualities. This constraint also prioritizes the shortest extension that meets the criteria, which is a nuanced requirement. 

This algorithm has a time complexity of `O(n)` and requires `O(1)` auxiliary space. It processes each character of each extension exactly once, making the computation requirements manageable for batches of tens to hundreds of extensions.
