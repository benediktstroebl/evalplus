```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strength = -1, -1
    for ext in extensions:
        cap = sum(c.isupper() for c in ext)
        sm = sum(c.islower() for c in ext)
        curr_strength = cap - sm
        if curr_strength > strength:
            strength, strongest = curr_strength, ext
    return f'{class_name}.{strongest}'
```

The function analyzes each extension, calculating the difference between the count of uppercase and lowercase letters. This difference corresponds to the `strength`. The code then selects the extension with the highest strength and retains the strongest extension's name in the variable `strongest`.
