```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strongest_index = 0, 0
    for i, ext in enumerate(extensions):
        cap = sum(c.isupper() for c in ext)
        sm = sum(c.islower() for c in ext)
        strength = cap - sm
        if strength > strongest:
            strongest, strongest_index = strength, i
    return f'{class_name}.{extensions[strongest_index]}'
```

The function iterates through the list of extensions, calculating the strength of each extension as the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in the extension name. If the calculated strength is greater than the current strongest strength, the function updates the strongest extension and its index in the list. Finally, the function returns the class name combined with the strongest extension name.

The expected output for the provided example in the prompt should be `'Slices.SErviNGSliCes'`, which is produced by the following test case in the provided script:
```python
test_list = ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed']
class_name = 'Slices'
expected_result = 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes'
actual_result = Strongest_Extension(class_name, test_list)
assert actual_result == expected_result
```
