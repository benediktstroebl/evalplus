```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, found = -1, -1
    for i, ext in enumerate(extensions):
        cap = sum(c.isupper() for c in ext)
        sm = sum(c.islower() for c in ext)
        strength = cap - sm
        if strength > strongest:
            strongest, found = strength, i
    return f'{class_name}.{extensions[found]}'
```

The script employs a for loop to iterate through each extension in the `extensions` list. For each extension, it calculates the number of uppercase letters (`cap`) and the number of lowercase letters (`sm`). The strength is determined as the difference between these two quantities. If the calculated strength is greater than the strength of the currently deemed strongest extension, the variables `strongest` and `found` are updated. Once all extensions have been analyzed, the script returns the strongest extension concatenated to the provided `class_name`.

The solution is encapsulated in a self-contained function, designed to be independent and executable from anywhere in a codebase, capable of accepting arguments as described in the problem statement, and returning a corresponding string. It achieves this via a for loop, some basic mathematical operations, and conditional statements.
