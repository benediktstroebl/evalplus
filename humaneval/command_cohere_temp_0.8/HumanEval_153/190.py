```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, found = -1, -1
    for i, ext in enumerate(extensions):
        cap = sum(c.isupper() for c in ext)
        sm = sum(c.islower() for c in ext)
        strength = cap - sm
        if strength > strongest or (strength == strongest and i < found):
            strongest, found = strength, i
    return f'{class_name}.{extensions[found]}'
```

The function analyzes each extension, calculating the difference between the count of uppercase and lowercase letters. The strongest extension is determined by finding the maximum strength value and its corresponding index, considering both strength and list position in case of ties. The function returns the class name combined with the strongest extension name. This approach ensures accurate identification of the strongest extension and adherence to the problem's criteria.
