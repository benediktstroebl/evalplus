```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strongest_index = -1, -1
 
    # Calculate the strength of each extension
    for index, extension in enumerate(extensions):
        cap_count = sum(1 for char in extension if char.isupper())
        sm_count = sum(1 for char in extension if char.islower())
        strength = cap_count - sm_count

        # Assign strongest extension and its index
        if strength > strongest:
            strongest, strongest_index = strength, index

    return f'{class_name}.{extensions[strongest_index]}'
```

The function analyzes each extension's name, calculating its strength as the difference between uppercase and lowercase letter counts. It then compares these strengths, choosing the strongest (negative value) extension and retaining its index for later. If multiple extensions share the strongest strength, it selects the first one by order in the list. The function outputs the class name combined with the strongest extension name, formatted as `'ClassName.StrongestExtensionName'`. 

This problem can be solved in a variety of ways. This solution uses a basic calculation that provides the required result and is concise.
