```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strength = -1, -1
    for e in extensions:
        cap = sum(1 for c in e if c.isupper())
        sm = sum(1 for c in e if c.islower())
        s = cap - sm
        if s > strength:
            strength, strongest = s, e
    return f'{class_name}.{strongest}'
```

The strength of the extension is determined by the difference between the number of uppercase letters and the number of lowercase letters in the extension name. The script iterates through the list of extensions, calculating the strength of each one, and selects the strongest extension among those with the same strength, choosing the one that comes first in the list. The function outputs the class name and the strongest extension name concatenated with a dot in between. 

The code tests use a variety of examples, such as validating edge cases with an empty extension list or a list containing only one extension, testing various class and extension names, and asserting accurate results for multiple scenarios. 

Let's break down the solution and discuss its components:

1. **Function Definition**: `Strongest_Extension` is the function defined to solve the problem. It takes two parameters: 
   - `class_name`: the name of the class to which extensions will be added.
   - `extensions`: a list of strings representing the available extensions.

2. **Variable Initialization**: Inside the function, two variables are initialized: 
   - `strongest`: this variable will hold the strongest extension found, determined by the highest strength value.
   - `strength`: used to keep track of the current highest strength value encountered. Initially set to -1 (i.e., the lowest possible strength).

3. **Looping Through Extensions**: The function iterates through each extension in the provided list of extensions: 
   - For each extension, it calculates two totals: 
     - `cap` counts the number of uppercase letters in the extension name.
     - `sm` counts the number of lowercase letters.
   - The strength of this extension is calculated as the difference between `cap` and `sm`. This difference is assigned to `s`.

4. **Updating Strength and Strongest**: The function compares the calculated strength (`s`) with the current highest strength (`strength`) encountered. If the current `s` is greater than the `strength`, the `strength` and `strongest` variables are updated to the new highest strength and the extension that achieved this value. 

5. **Returning the Result**: After processing all extensions, the function returns the formatted result string, which consists of the class name followed by a dot and the strongest extension name. 

The tests included illustrate how the function behaves with various inputs and validate its accuracy in determining the strongest extension.
