```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strongest_name = -1, ""
    for name in extensions:
        cap = sum(1 for c in name if c.isupper())
        sm = sum(1 for c in name if c.islower())
        strength = cap - sm
        if strength > strongest:
            strongest, strongest_name = strength, name
    return f"{class_name}.{strongest_name}"
```

The function analyzes each extension, calculating the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters. The strongest extension is determined by comparing the calculated strengths, selecting the one with the greatest difference. In cases of equal strength, the first extension in the list is chosen. The function returns the class name combined with the strongest extension name.

Here is an example of usage:
```python
print(Strongest_Extension("Slices", ["SErviNGSliCes", "Cheese", "StuFfed"]))
```

The output will be `Slices.SErviNGSliCes`, indicating that the `SErviNGSliCes` extension is the most potent, surpassing others in the provided example.
