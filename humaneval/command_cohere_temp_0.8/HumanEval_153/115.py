```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strongest_name = -1, ""
    for ext in extensions:
        cap = sum(1 for c in ext if c.isupper())
        sm = sum(1 for c in ext if c.islower())
        strength = cap - sm
        if strength > strongest:
            strongest, strongest_name = strength, ext
    return f"{class_name}.{strongest_name}"
```

The function iterates through the list of extensions, calculating the strength of each extension as the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in the extension name. The strongest extension is selected based on this strength metric and the default ordering in case of ties. The function then returns the result in the desired format, "ClassName.StrongestExtensionName".
