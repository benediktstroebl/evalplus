```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, found = 0, -1
    for i, ext in enumerate(extensions):
        cap = sum(c.isupper() for c in ext)
        sm = sum(c.islower() for c in ext)
        strength = cap - sm
        if strength > strongest:
            strongest, found = strength, i
    return f'{class_name}.{extensions[found]}'
```

The function uses a simple calculation to determine the strength of an extension, then selects the strongest extension from the given list, with ties broken in favor of the extension that appears first in the list.
