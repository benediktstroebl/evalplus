```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strength = -1, -1
    for e in extensions:
        cap = sum(1 for c in e if c.isupper())
        sm = sum(1 for c in e if c.islower())
        s = cap - sm
        if s > strength:
            strength, strongest = s, e
    return f'{class_name}.{strongest}'
```

The function calculates the strength of each extension as the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in the name. The strongest extension is selected based on this strength value, with ties broken by choosing the extension that appears first in the list.

This approach guarantees the correct strongest extension while maintaining a straightforward and efficient implementation. Let's break down the solution step by step:
1. **Function Definition**: We're given the problem statement in the form of a function definition: `Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions)`. This function takes in two parameters:
   - `class_name`: A string representing the name of the class.
   - `extensions`: A list of string values, where each string is an extension name.
2. **Finding the Strongest Extension**: The goal is to find the strongest extension among those provided in the `extensions` list. The strength of each extension is calculated based on the difference between uppercase and lowercase letters in its name. The extension with the strongest strength is selected and combined with the `class_name` to form the final string result.
3. **Return Value**: The function should return the string in the format `ClassName.StrongestExtensionName`, where `ClassName` is the provided class name and `StrongestExtensionName` is the name of the strongest extension.
4. **Handling Tied Strengths**: In case multiple extensions have the same strength, we must break the tie to select the correct strongest extension. The problem statement instructs us to prioritize the extension that appears first in the `extensions` list.
5. **Loop Through Extensions**: We initialize the strongest extension found and its corresponding strength to -1 (since we haven't found the strongest extension yet). We loop through each extension in the `extensions` list.
6. **Calculate Strength**: For each extension, we calculate its strength by subtracting the number of lowercase letters in the name from the number of uppercase letters. This difference gives us a numerical value representing the strength, with a negative value indicating the strength.
7. **Update Strongest Extension**: If the calculated strength is greater than the current strongest strength, we update both the strongest extension and its corresponding strength.
8. **Return Result**: After looping through all extensions, we return the result string f'{class_name}.{strongest}', where strongest is the name of the strongest extension found.

This approach efficiently solves the problem by calculating the strength of each extension and selecting the strongest one while handling ties as required.
