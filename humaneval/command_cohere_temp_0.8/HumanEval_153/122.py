```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strongest_index = 0, 0
    for i, ext in enumerate(extensions):
        cap = sum(c.isupper() for c in ext)
        sm = sum(c.islower() for c in ext)
        strength = cap - sm
        if strength > strongest:
            strongest, strongest_index = strength, i
    return f'{class_name}.{extensions[strongest_index]}'
```

The function calculates the strength of each extension as the difference between uppercase and lowercase letters in the extension name. The strongest extension is selected, and if there are ties, the extension that appears first in the list is chosen. The function returns the result in the format ClassName.StrongestExtension.
