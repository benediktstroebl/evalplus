```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, found = -1, -1
    for i, ext in enumerate(extensions):
        cap = sum(c.isupper() for c in ext)
        sm = sum(c.islower() for c in ext)
        strength = cap - sm
        if strength > strongest or (strength == strongest and i < found):
            strongest, found = strength, i
    return f'{class_name}.{extensions[found]}'
```

The script employs a loop to examine each extension, assessing the strength of each by calculating the difference between the count of uppercase and lowercase letters. If the strength is higher than the current strongest or, in the event of a tie, if the extension's sequence position is earlier, it updates the strongest and found indices. Ultimately, the function returns the class name appended with the name of the strongest extension. 

The implementation thrives in compliance with the problem's guidelines, emphasizing the significance of uppercase to lowercase letter differentials in extension strength while prioritizing earlier listed extensions in the event of strength ties. 

This approach enables the function to efficiently identify and append the strongest extension when invoked with a class name and a list of extensions, offering a dependable solution.
