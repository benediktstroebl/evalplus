```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, found = -1, -1
    for i, ext in enumerate(extensions):
        cap = sum(c.isupper() for c in ext)
        sm = sum(c.islower() for c in ext)
        strength = cap - sm
        if strength > strongest:
            strongest, found = strength, i
    return f'{class_name}.{extensions[found]}'
```

The function uses two variables, `strongest` and `found`, to keep track of the current strongest extension and the index of this extension in the `extensions` list. The function then loops through the list of extensions, calculating the strength of each extension as the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters it contains. If the strength is greater than the current strongest strength, the function updates the `strongest` and `found` variables.

Finally, the function returns the string `class_name. strongest_extension`, where `strongest_extension` is the extension with the strongest strength, selected by the `found` index. If multiple extensions have the same strength, the one encountered first in the list is selected. And the solution adheres to the problem's directive to return a string in the format `ClassName.StrongestExtensionName`.
