```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strongest_name = -1, ""
    for ext in extensions:
        cap = sum(1 for c in ext if c.isupper())
        sm = sum(1 for c in ext if c.islower())
        strength = cap - sm
        if strength > strongest:
            strongest, strongest_name = strength, ext
    return f"{class_name}.{strongest_name}"
```

The function analyzes each extension, calculating the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters. The strength of the extension is this difference, with a larger value indicating higher strength. The strongest extension is selected, considering cases where strength is tied. The function returns the class name combined with the strongest extension name.

This solution is concise and directly addresses the problem statement, utilizing letter-based calculations for strength and efficient conditional processing for strength comparison and extension selection. It adheres to the problem's specified criteria and formatting for the final output.
