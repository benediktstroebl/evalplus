```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, found = 0, -1
    for i, ext in enumerate(extensions):
        cap = sum(c.isupper() for c in ext)
        sm = sum(c.islower() for c in ext)
        strength = cap - sm
        if strength > strongest:
            strongest, found = strength, i
    return f'{class_name}.{extensions[found]}'
```

The script employs a loop to examine each extension, assessing the capitalization tally of each extension with upper and lowercase letter counters. The difference between these two counts constitutes the strength of the extension, which is then compared across extensions to identify the strongest. If multiple extensions share the same strength, the extension that precedes the others in the list is selected. The function finishes by returning the class name combined with the strongest extension. 

The code is encapsulated within a test block, where the function is put to the test with several scenarios that mirror the problem's examples. You can incorporate this into your codebase to solve the associated problem statement. 
If you wish to amend the tests accordingly, you can do so within this code block, specifically in the `tests` list. Do you have further questions on customization or coding problems you'd like to resolve? Feel free to ask.
