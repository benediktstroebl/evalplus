```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, found = -1, -1
    for i, ext in enumerate(extensions):
        cap = sum(c.isupper() for c in ext)
        sm = sum(c.islower() for c in ext)
        strength = cap - sm
        if strength > strongest or (strength == strongest and i < found):
            strongest, found = strength, i
    return f'{class_name}.{extensions[found]}'
```

The script employs a loop to analyze each extension, assessing the strength of each by calculating the difference between uppercase and lowercase letters. When the loop is through, the script retrieves the index of the strongest extension from the list and then returns the class name combined with the strongest extension name.

To verify the functionality of the script, a test list exists that prompts the function with various class and extension sets. The function is expected to output the correct class name combined with the strongest appropriate extension, which is checked for through comparison with the accurate output. Overall, the Python code furnishes a self-contained solution to the problem presented.
