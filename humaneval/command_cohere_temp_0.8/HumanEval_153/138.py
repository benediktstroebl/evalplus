```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strongest_name = -1, ""
    for ext in extensions:
        cap = sum(1 for c in ext if c.isupper())
        sm = sum(1 for c in ext if c.islower())
        strength = cap - sm
        if strength > strongest:
            strongest, strongest_name = strength, ext
    return f'{class_name}.{strongest_name}'
```

The function analyzes each extension, calculating the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters. The strength of the extension is this difference, with a larger value indicating higher strength. The strongest extension is selected, considering cases where strength is tied. The function returns the class name combined with the strongest extension name.

This solution is concise and directly addresses the problem statement, employing inline variables for efficient tracking of strength and extension names. The breakdown of the logic is:
1. A variable `strongest` that stores the highest strength found and a variable `strongest_name` that stores the corresponding extension are initialized.
2. Each extension is processed, calculating its strength and comparing it to the current strongest.
3. If the current extension has greater strength, the `strongest` and `strongest_name` values are updated.
4. Upon processing all extensions, the function returns the formatted result.
