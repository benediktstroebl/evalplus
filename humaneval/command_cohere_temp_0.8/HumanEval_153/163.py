```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strength = -1, -1
    for ext in extensions:
        cap = sum(c.isupper() for c in ext)
        sm = sum(c.islower() for c in ext)
        s = cap - sm
        if s > strength:
            strength, strongest = s, ext
    return f'{class_name}.{strongest}'
```

The function calculates the difference between the count of uppercase and lowercase letters for each extension, which represents the strength of the extension. The strongest extension is selected based on this strength measurement, and the function returns the class name combined with the strongest extension name.

This solution is concise and directly addresses the requirements of the problem statement, making it an efficient and effective implementation.

This approach uses a single loop to analyze each extension only once, which improves efficiency and simplifies the code structure. Additionally, it uses variable assignments to store the strongest extension and its corresponding strength, ensuring that the strongest extension is correctly updated whenever a stronger extension is encountered.
