```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strongest_name = -1, ''
    for e in extensions:
        cap = sum(1 for c in e if c.isupper())
        sm = sum(1 for c in e if c.islower())
        strength = cap - sm
        if strength > strongest:
            strongest, strongest_name = strength, e
    return f'{class_name}.{strongest_name}'
```

The function uses two variables, `strongest` and `strongest_name`, which are initialized to `-1 and an empty string`, respectively. The reason for initializing `strongest` to `-1` rather than `0` is that the strength of the extension is determined by the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters. Having `strongest` start at `-1` allows the code to correctly interpret a string with all uppercase letters as the strongest extension.

The function then iterates through each extension in the list and calculates the strength of the extension by counting the number of uppercase letters and subtracting the number of lowercase letters. If the strength is greater than the current strongest extension, the function updates the `strongest` and `strongest_name` variables to the new strength and the name of the current extension, respectively.

Finally, the function returns the string `class_name.strongest_name`, which provides the strongest extension for the given class name. 

This solution assumes that the list of extensions is valid and that there are no syntax errors in the extensions' names. If the input contains invalid syntax or whitespace, the code may still run but may not return the expected results. It's important to note that this solution focuses solely on the strength calculation and assumes that the list of extensions is valid Python syntax.
