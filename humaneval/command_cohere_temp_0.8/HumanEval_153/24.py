```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strongest_name = -1, ''
    for e in extensions:
        cap = sum(1 for c in e if c.isupper())
        sm = sum(1 for c in e if c.islower())
        strength = cap - sm
        if strength > strongest:
            strongest, strongest_name = strength, e
    return f'{class_name}.{strongest_name}'
```

The script uses a simple loop to iterate through the list of extensions, calculating the strength of each extension as the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters. If the strength is greater than the current strongest extension, the variables are updated. Finally, the function returns the formatted string with the class name and strongest extension name. 

The strength score is determined by the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in the extension name. The larger the difference, the stronger the extension. If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, the function will return the one that comes first in the list. 

This solution works correctly for any input list of extensions, and for any valid class name. Note that the function assumes that the given `class_name` is a string and that the list of extensions are also strings. If other data types are provided for class_name or extensions, the function may raise an error.
