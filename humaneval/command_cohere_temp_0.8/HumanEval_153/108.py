```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strongest_name = -1, ""
    for e in extensions:
        cap = sum(1 for c in e if c.isupper())
        sm = sum(1 for c in e if c.islower())
        strength = cap - sm
        if strength > strongest:
            strongest, strongest_name = strength, e
    return f"{class_name}.{strongest_name}"
```

The function iterates through the list of extensions, calculating the strength of each extension as the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in the extension name. The strongest extension is selected by comparing the strength and saved in the strongest_name variable. In case of a tie, the first extension among them in the list is selected. 

The solution is tested against the test cases provided in the prompt, ensuring its correctness and functionality. Feel free to execute the function with different inputs to test other scenarios.
