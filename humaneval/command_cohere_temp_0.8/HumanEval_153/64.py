```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strongest_index = -1, -1
 
    # Calculate the strength of each extension
    for index, extension in enumerate(extensions):
        cap_count = sum(1 for char in extension if char.isupper())
        sm_count = sum(1 for char in extension if char.islower())
        strength = cap_count - sm_count
        if strength > strongest:
            strongest, strongest_index = strength, index
    return f'{class_name}.{extensions[strongest_index]}'
```

The function analyzes each extension's name, calculating its strength as the difference between uppercase and lowercase letter counts. It then selects the strongest extension and remembers its index for later. If multiple extensions share the same strength, the one encountered first is chosen. The function returns the class name combined with the strongest extension name, formatted as `'ClassName.StrongestExtensionName'`. 

The solution relies on the assumption that the input strings have only letters. Also, it's important to note that the solution uses a loop to iterate through the extensions, and the `enumerate` function to obtain the index of each extension. This is to prepare for scenarios where we need to access the index of the strongest extension.
