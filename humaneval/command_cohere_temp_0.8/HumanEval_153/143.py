```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest, strongest_index = -1, -1
 
    # Calculate the strength of each extension
    for index, extension in enumerate(extensions):
        cap = sum(char.isupper() for char in extension)
        sm = sum(char.islower() for char in extension)
        strength = cap - sm
        if strength > strongest:
            strongest, strongest_index = strength, index
    return f'{class_name}.{extensions[strongest_index]}'
```

The script calculates the strength of each extension as the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in the names. After computing these strengths, it identifies the strongest extension by searching for the maximum strength and its corresponding index. The function then constructs and returns the desired string. 

The solution relies on Python's innate string manipulation abilities and behavioral norms, thus avoiding any extraneous package dependencies. As a result, the code is both self-contained and concise.
