Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you've outlined, including code coverage with specified tests:
```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """ Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string. Count overlaping cases. """
    count = 0
    substring_length = len(substring)
    string_length = len(string) 
    for i in range(string_length - substring_length + 1):
        if string[i:i+substring_length] == substring:
            count += 1
    return count

# Tests
def test_how_many_times():
    """ Test the how_many_times function for various cases. """
    assert how_many_times('', 'a') == 0
    assert how_many_times('aaa', 'a') == 3
    assert how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa') == 3
    assert how_many_times('aaa', 'aa') == 2
    assert how_many_times('bbb', 'b') == 2
    assert how_many_times('bbbbb', 'bb') == 4

test_how_many_times()
```
This script includes a function `how_many_times` which calculates the number of times a substring occurs within a given string. It accounts for overlapping instances of the substring. The code also includes a test module with a function `test_how_many_times` that verifies the correctness of `how_many_times` for a variety of cases. 

This code should help you achieve the desired solution and comply with the specified tests. Let me know if you have any other questions!
