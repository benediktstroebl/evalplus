Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you've described, including a markdown code block, and sample tests using the `pytest` framework:
```python
import pytest

def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """ Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string. Count overlaping cases. """
    return string.count(substring)

# Test cases:
pytest.assertEqual(how_many_times('', 'a'), 0)
pytest.assertEqual(how_many_times('aaa', 'a'), 3)
pytest.assertEqual(how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa'), 3)

# If you have more test cases, you can add them above, each test case should be defined using pytest's assert functions like assertEqual to check for expected results.
```

This script defines the `how_many_times` function as per the specification, and uses `pytest` to define the test cases. 

You can add more test cases as needed, and the `pytest` framework will automatically run them and report any failures or problems with the function's implementation.
