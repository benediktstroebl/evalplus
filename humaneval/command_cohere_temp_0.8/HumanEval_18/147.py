Here's a Python script that contains a function called `how_many_times` that solves the problem:
```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    count = 0
    substring_length = len(substring)
    string_length = len(string) 
    max_distance = string_length - substring_length  # To account for cases where substring can be at the very end of the string
    
    for i in range(string_length - substring_length + 1):
        if string[i:i+substring_length] == substring:
            count += 1
            max_distance -= 1
        if max_distance < 0: 
            break
    
    return count
```

To test the function, it is run against various inputs, and the returned values are checked against the expected values. The tests are defined below:
```python
# Test cases
>>> how_many_times('', 'a')
0
>>> how_many_times('aaa', 'a')
3
>>> how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')
3
>>> how_many_times('aaaaab', 'aa')
3
>>> how_many_times('aaaaab', 'b')
2
```

This script can be imported and used in another Python program or run directly to test out the function.
