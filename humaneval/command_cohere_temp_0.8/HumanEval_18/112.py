Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you've outlined, including tests:
```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """ Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string. Count overlaping cases. """
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(string)):
        for j in range(i, len(string)):
            if string[i:j+1] == substring:
                count += 1
    return count

# Tests
def test_empty_string():
    assert how_many_times('', 'a') == 0

def test_matching_substring():
    assert how_many_times('aaa', 'a') == 3
    assert how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa') == 3

def test_non_matching_substring():
    assert how_many_times('aaa', 'b') == 0

def test_equal_strings():
    assert how_many_times('a', 'a') == 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import unittest
    unittest.main()
```
This script includes a test suite with four test functions (`test_empty_string`, `test_matching_substring`, `test_non_matching_substring`, and `test_equal_strings`) that cover different scenarios and ensure the function `how_many_times` behaves as expected. When you run this script, the tests will be executed, and any that fail will be reported. 
If you want to create more tests, you can add them to the test suite to cover other edge cases and confirm they pass. 

Make sure to run the script in a Python environment that has the markdown library installed (pip install markdown). You can verify this by running the script in an environment where the markdown library is installed, and you'll see the formatted markdown output. Hava a nice day!
