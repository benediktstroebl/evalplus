```python
def how_many_times(string, substring):
    return string.count(substring)
```

This function accepts a string and a substring and uses the `count()` method to return the number of times the substring occurs in the string. Note that this counts overlapping occurrences, as specified in the original problem. 

This solution is concise and efficient, capable of solving the problem without the need for additional libraries.
