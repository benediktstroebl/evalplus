```python
def how_many_times(string, substring):
    return string.count(substring)
```

This function accepts a string and a substring as inputs and returns the number of times the substring occurs in the string, even if the substring occurs multiple times in the string. This is a demonstration of how to use Python's `count` method to solve this problem. Let me know if you would like me to explain any further.
