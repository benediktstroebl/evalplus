Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you've outlined, including tests:
```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """ Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string. Count overlaping cases. """
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(string)-len(substring)+1):
        if string[i:i+len(substring)] == substring:
            count += 1
    return count

# Test cases
assert how_many_times('', 'a') == 0
assert how_many_times('aaa', 'a') == 3
assert how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa') == 3
assert how_many_times('aaabbbbbbbbb', 'ab') == 2
```
This script includes a function `how_many_times` that takes a string `string` and a substring `substring` as input and calculates the number of times the substring occurs in the string, including overlapping instances. It uses a loop to iterate over possible starts for the substring and uses string matching to check for a match. This is followed by asserting the function behaves as expected for different use cases. 
`how_many_times('', 'a')` == 0`: An empty string has no "a" substring. 
`how_many_times('aaa', 'a')` == 3: "aaa" has three instances of the "a" substring. 
`how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')` == 3: "aaaa" has three instances of the overlapping "aa" substring. 
`how_many_times('aaabbbbbbbbb', 'ab')` == 2: "aaabbbbbbbbb" has two instances of the "ab" substring, excluding overlaps. 
You can use this code to test your function's behavior against different cases, providing a more robust solution.
