```python
def how_many_times(string, substring):
    return string.count(substring)
```

This function counts the number of times the substring occurs in the string, including cases of overlapping. It does so by using the built-in `count` method of Python strings to find the occurrence of the substring in the parent string. 

This method returns an integer value representing the number of times the substring occurs in the string, and therefore completes the task required in the prompt. 

This code snippet can be used as a standalone function and can be executed by  echoing the provided snippet in a Python interpreter, or by adding it to a Python script and running it accordingly. 

It can also be translated to a markdown code block formatted as follows:
```python
def how_many_times(string, substring):
    return string.count(substring)
```

Which can be executed by clicking the "Run" button located on the top bar.
