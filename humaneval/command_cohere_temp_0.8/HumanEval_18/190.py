Here's a Python function that solves the problem you've outlined, with tests included:
```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """ Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string. Count overlaping cases. """
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(string)):
        for j in range(i, len(string)):
            if string[i:j+1] == substring:
                count += 1
    return count

# Test cases
assert how_many_times('', 'a') == 0
assert how_many_times('aaa', 'a') == 3
assert how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa') == 3
assert how_many_times('aaa', 'aaa') == 1
```

This function uses two nested loops to iterate through different intervals within the input string, comparing each interval to the given substring. The test cases verify the function's behavior for different scenarios.
