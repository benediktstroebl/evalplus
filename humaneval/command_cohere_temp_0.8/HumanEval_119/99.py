```python
def match_parens(lst):
    # Initialize the parentheses count for each variant
    count1 = 0
    count2 = 0
    
    for char in lst[0]:
        if char == '(':
            count1 += 1
        elif char == ')':
            count1 -= 1
    
    for char in lst[1]:
        if char == '(':
            count2 += 1
        elif char == ')':
            count2 -= 1
    
    # Check if the two strings can form a balanced one
    if max(count1, count2) == 0:
        return "Yes"
    
    return "No"
```

The function `match_parens` takes a list of two strings as input and initially counts the parentheses characters in each string. It then checks if the counts have any overlap (i.e., their maximum is zero or both are non-positive) and returns "Yes" if so, indicating the two strings can form a balanced one when concatenated. If there is no overlap, it returns "No" since no order of concatenation would result in a balanced string. 

This approach avoids any recursive or stack space overhead, making it efficient and suitable for large inputs. It also has a clear comprehension and returns the correct answer based on the provided criteria. 

The function above is reusable and efficiently solves the problem, making it a comprehensive and stand-alone solution.
