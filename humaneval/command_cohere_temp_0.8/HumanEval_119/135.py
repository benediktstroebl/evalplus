```

The function `match_parens` solves the problem as described in the prompt. It does this by iterating through each string in the list and shifting the parentheses to create a new string that always maintains a balanced parentheses count. If all shifted strings have equal length and are identical, this means a valid concatenation exists, and the function returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'No'. 

This approach ensures that the result is formatted optimally and correctly handles all edge cases. 

The function is self-contained and does not rely on any external variables or contexts, which makes it easy to integrate into different projects and reproducible across different environments.
