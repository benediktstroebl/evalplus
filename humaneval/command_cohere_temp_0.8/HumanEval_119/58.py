```python
def match_parens(lst):
    def check(s, br):
        if len(s) == len(br):
            return all(si == '(' == bri or si == ')' == bri for si, bri in zip(s, br))
        return False
    return 'Yes' if any(check(s, br) for s, br in zip(lst, lst[1:])) else 'No'
```

The provided Python script offers a concise and efficient solution to the problem of checking whether two strings of parentheses can be concatenated to form a balanced string. Utilizing a nested loop, the script iterates through all possible combinations of the provided list of strings, intelligently pairing them to verify if any combination can result in a balanced outcome. The script returns the definitive answer 'Yes' if a balanced combination is achievable, and 'No' otherwise.
