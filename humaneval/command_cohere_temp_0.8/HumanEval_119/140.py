```python
def match_parens(lst):
    open_tup = tuple(c for c in lst[0] if c == '(')
    close_tup = tuple(c for c in lst[1] if c == ')')
    return "Yes" if len(open_tup) == len(close_tup) else "No"
```

The provided solution exploits the fact that the given strings consist only of '(' or ')' characters. It uses Python's built-in `tuple()` function to create tuples from the characters of each string based on whether they are '(' or ')' and then checks if their lengths are equal. Two tuples of equal length ensure an equal number of '(' and ')' which guarantees a balanced string. Hence, the function returns "Yes" if it's possible to form a balanced string and "No" otherwise. 

This approach allows the code to remain concise and easily interpretable while still being effective in handling the problem.
