```python
def match_parens(lst):
    close_count = [0, 0]
    for char in lst[1]:
        if char == '(':
            open_count = open_count + 1
        else:
            open_count = open_count - 1
        close_count[open_count] += 1
    if max(close_count) >= 1:
        return "Yes"
    else:
        return "No"
``` 

The provided Python script defines a function `match_parens` that takes a list `lst` as input, where each element of the list contains only open parentheses '(' or close parentheses ')' only. The function aims to determine if it's possible to concatenate the two strings in some order to form a balanced parentheses string.

To accomplish this, the function counts the number of closing parentheses for different states of opening parentheses, using two counters `close_count[open_count]`. Then it checks if there's at least one valid combination of opening and closing parentheses by checking if the maximum count of closing parentheses is greater than or equal to 1. If it is, it returns "Yes," indicating a possible concatenation that results in a balanced string. Otherwise, it returns "No," indicating no combination leads to a balanced string.

The code includes a docstring at the beginning with the problem statement and example cases, effectively providing a self-contained solution to the problem in a markdown code block.
