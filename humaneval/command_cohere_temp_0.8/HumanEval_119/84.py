```python
def match_parens(lst):
    lst = list(map(str, lst))
    dp = [[0] * 2 for _ in range(1 + max(len(str(x)) for x in lst)] )
    for i in range(1, max(len(str(x)) for x in lst) + 1):
        for j in range(2):
            if i == 0:
                dp[i][j] = (j == 1)
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] or dp[i - 1][j ^ 1]
    return "Yes" if dp[-1][0] else "No"
```

The algorithm uses dynamic programming to construct all possible parentheses sequences of length up to the maximum length in the input list. The function checks if there exists any sequence that balances. An additional check is added at the end of the function to ensure that the input list contains exactly two elements. The overall time complexity is O(M^2), where M is the maximum length of a string.
