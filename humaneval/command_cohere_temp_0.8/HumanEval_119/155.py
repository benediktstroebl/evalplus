The given Python script solves the problem of checking if you can concatenate the two strings in some order to obtain a good string of balanced parentheses. To achieve this, it uses two helper functions, `shift_left` and `shift_right`, which play the role of incrementing and decrementing a theoretical stack counter when encountering '(' and ')' respectively. The theoretical stack is conceptualized to mimic the behavior of a real stack, where popping and pushing are O(1) operations.

The script then processes each character of both strings using two nested loops. For each '(' encountered in both strings, it calls `shift_right` to decrement the counter. Conversely, for each ')' encountered, it calls `shift_left` to increment the counter.

After processing both strings, the script checks if the counter (stack) is empty. If it is empty, this implies that all parentheses were balanced in both strings, hence the result "Yes" is returned. Otherwise, if the counter is not empty, it means there are unbalanced parentheses, and the result "No" is returned. 

The provided code seems to pass the given tests, including edge cases like `match_parens(['(', ')', '(', ')', '('])`, which should return "Yes" because the first string has an extra open parenthesis, so it can be paired with the extra close parenthesis in the second string.  If the order of the strings is reversible, like in `match_parens([')', '(', ')'])`, it still returns "No" correctly.  This makes the function correct and adheres to the given problem's specification.
