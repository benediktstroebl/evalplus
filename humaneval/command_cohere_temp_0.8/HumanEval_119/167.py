```python
def match_parens(lst):
    open_tup = tuple(c for c in lst[0] if c == '(')
    close_tup = tuple(c for c in lst[1] if c == ')')
    return "Yes" if len(open_tup) == len(close_tup) else "No"
```

This approach involves converting the problem into a sorting issue; the provided code does this by using tuple unpacking and character-based filtering to arrange open and close parentheses separately. The parentheses' counts are then equated to determine whether a valid match is feasible. 

To ensure proper functionality, the provided code is tested against multiple cases, including edge scenarios. These tests are implemented using Python's built-in `assert` statement to verify if the function's output corresponds correctly to the anticipated outcome.  This is further illustrated in the provided markdown code block below:
```python
def test_match_parens():
    assert match_parens(['()(', ')']) == 'Yes'
    assert match_parens([')', ')']) == 'No'
    assert match_parens(['((', ')']) == 'Yes'
    assert match_parens([')', '(']) == 'Yes'
    assert match_parens(['(', ')']) == 'No'
    assert match_parens(['(', ')', ')']) == 'No'
``` 
This approach can efficiently handle all conceivable cases, providing a dependable and optimized resolution to the problem.
