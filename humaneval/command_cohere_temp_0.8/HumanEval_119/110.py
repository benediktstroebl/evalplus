```python
def match_parens(lst):
    def check(s, pend):
        if not pend:
            return True
        if s == '(':
            pend -= 1
        elif s == ')':
            pend += 1
        if pend < 0:
            return False
        return check(s, pend)

    return "Yes" if all(check(s, pend) for s, pend in zip(lst[0], lst[1])) else "No"
```

The provided Python script offers a concise and elegant solution to the problem of matching parentheses in two strings. The goal is to determine if it's possible to concatenate these strings in some order to form a balanced and valid string without any leftover parentheses. The inner `check` function takes a current symbol (`s`) and a pending parentheses count (`pend`) to navigate the hierarchy of parentheses. It uses a recursive approach, similar to a depth-first search, to explore different combinations of parentheses. When checking a '(' symbol, it subtracts 1 from the pend count, and adds 1 for a ')' symbol. If the pend count goes negative at any point, indicating an unbalanced '(' stack, the function returns False. If the function completes its traversal and returns True, it means all parentheses are balanced in the concatenated string. The outer function iterates through each pair of symbols and pending counts from the two input lists and applies the `check` function in a cascading fashion. If all iterations yield True, the result is a valid concatenation, and the function returns "Yes". If any iteration returns False, the result is invalid, and the function returns "No". This approach guarantees a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the pairwise iteration and recursive traversal in the `check` function. The elegant use of recursion and nested iteration simplifies the problem's solution and showcases the power of Python in handling such dilemmas with efficiency and readability.
