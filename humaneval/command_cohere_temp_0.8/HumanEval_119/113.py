```python
def match_parens(lst):
    open_tup = tuple(c for c in lst[0] if c == '(')
    close_tup = tuple(c for c in lst[1] if c == ')')
    return "Yes" if len(open_tup) == len(close_tup) else "No"
```

The provided solution exploits the fact that the given strings consist of open or close parentheses only, eliminating the need for more complex parsing techniques. By creating tuples of open and close parentheses, we can perform a simple equality check to determine if the lengths of both tuples are equal, implying that it is possible to construct a balanced string by concatenating the two inputs in some order. Consequently, the function returns "Yes" in such cases and "No" otherwise.

This approach offers a straightforward solution to the problem while maintaining efficiency in terms of both time and memory complexity, as such a comparison between tuples is an inherently constant-time operation. The code adheres to the specified requirements and provides the intended functionality. 

This script defines a function `match_parens` that takes a list of two strings as input and returns a string indicating whether the two strings can be concatenated to form a balanced parentheses string. The function first uses list comprehensions to create tuples of open and close parentheses from the two input strings. It then checks if the lengths of these tuples are equal and returns "Yes" if they are, and "No" otherwise. 

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```python
print(match_parens(["(", ")"])) # Yes
print(match_parens(["(", "("])) # No
```

This will output:
```
Yes
No
```

These results reflect the correct behavior of the function as described in the problem statement.
