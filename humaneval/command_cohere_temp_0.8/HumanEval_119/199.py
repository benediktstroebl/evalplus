```python
def match_parens(lst):
    # Ensure that the first and last characters are ( and ) respectively
    if lst[0][0] == '(' and lst[-1][-1] == ')':
        ans = 'Yes'
    else:
        ans = 'No'
    
    # Check if one of the strings is just a pair of parentheses
    if len(lst) == 1:
        return ans
    
    # Check if one of the strings has just one parenthesis
    for i in lst:
        if len(i) == 1:
            return 'No'
    
    # Ensure that all other strings have even lengths and are balanced
    for i in lst:
        if len(i) % 2 != 0 or i.count('(') != i.count(')'):
            return 'No'
    
    return ans
```

The approach checks for the simplest cases of one-element strings being balanced or having balanced parentheses, then checks for all strings to have even lengths and balanced parentheses. If all conditions are met, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'. 

To make sure that the function behaves as expected, you can add test cases in the Markdown code block like so:
```python
test_cases = [
    ['()(', ')'],
    ['((', '))'],
    [')', ')('],
    ['(]', ')('],
    [')(', '('],
    ['((((((', '))))))' ],
]

for i in test_cases:
    assert match_parens(i) == 'Yes'

empty_test_cases = [
    [],
    [')', '('],
    ['(', ')'],
    ['(', ')',"foo', 'bar']
]

for i in empty_test_cases:
    assert match_parens(i) == 'No'
```
