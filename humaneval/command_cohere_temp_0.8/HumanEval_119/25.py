```python
def match_parens(lst):
    open_tup = tuple(map(count_parens, lst[0]))
    close_tup = tuple(map(count_parens, lst[1]))
    
    return "Yes" if open_tup == close_tup else "No"

def count_parens(s):
    return len(s) // 2
```
The `match_parens` function takes in a list of two strings, both containing only open or close parentheses. It employs the `count_parens` helper function to calculate the number of open parentheses in each string. These counts are then compared through tupling to determine if the two strings can be concatenated in some order to form a balanced string. If the counts match, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".
