```python
def match_parens(lst):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        return "Invalid input"
    s = ['(', ')', '*', '+', '^']
    dp = [0] * (1 << len(s))
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i, len(s)):
            if s[i] + s[j] in lst:
                dp[i | j] = 1
    if sum(dp) == 0:
        return "No"
    return "Yes"
``` 

The approach uses dynamic programming with a dictionary representation to check if it is possible to concatenate the two strings in some order and still result in a balanced string. A sum of all valid combinations (represented as binary) is calculated and checked. An example of such a combination is `('()', '())'.` 

The script also checks for the validity of the input and casts the returned result accordingly. 
To cast the output into a string format, a `join` method is implicitly called on an empty list, which results in an empty string `"No"`. If the input is not valid, the function returns as well.
