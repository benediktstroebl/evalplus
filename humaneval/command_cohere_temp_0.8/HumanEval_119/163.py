```python
def match_parens(lst):
    def shift(s):
        cnt = 0
        for char in s:
            if char == '(':
                cnt += 1
            elif char == ')':
                cnt -= 1
            if cnt < 0:
                return False
        return cnt == 0

    return 'Yes' if shift(lst[0] + lst[1]) else 'No'
```

The provided Python script offers a concise and elegant solution to the problem of checking if two strings composed of parentheses can be concatenated to form a balanced string. Utilizing a function called `shift`, the script assesses the balance of parentheses in the concatenated string by accounting for the shift in parentheses count as the string is traversed. To apply this method, the function simply combines the two input strings and checks if the resulting concatenated string upholds a balanced count of parentheses. If this condition is met, the function returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No', indicating that the concatenation would result in an unbalanced string. The `shift` function elegantly handles the parentheses count, providing a straightforward solution to the problem.
