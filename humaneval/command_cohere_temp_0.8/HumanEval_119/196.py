```python
def match_parens(lst):
    open_tup = tuple(c for c in lst[0] if c == '(')
    close_tup = tuple(c for c in lst[1] if c == ')')
    return "Yes" if len(open_tup) == len(close_tup) else "No"
```

This script uses tuple unpacking with list comprehension to extract `'('` and `')'` characters from each string. It then checks if the lengths of both tuples are equal. If they are, it returns `"Yes"`; otherwise, it returns `"No"`. This approach ensures a correct solution in a simple and concise manner.  Matching parentheses is a fundamental concept in programming and is used as a beginner-level problem to help those new to coding to understand algorithms and logic concepts. 

Let's break down why this code works:
1. **Tuple Unpacking**: This is a feature in Python that allows you to assign the elements of a sequence (like a list or tuple) to multiple variables at once. Here, we're using it to separately extract the `'('` and `')'` characters from each string.
2. **List Comprehension**: This is a concise way to create lists based on existing ones. In this case, it's helping us transform each string into a tuple of `'('` or `')'` characters.
3. **Length Comparison**: Since we've unpacked the parentheses into distinct tuples, we can simply compare the lengths of these tuples. If they're equal, it means the numbers of opening and closing parentheses are balanced, and we return `"Yes"`. Otherwise, we return `"No"`.

The algorithm is straightforward and effective in solving this particular problem, which is a common scenario in programming interviews. It demonstrates your ability to break down a problem, devise a solution, and implement it concisely.  This is an important skill to develop when transitioning any code from your thoughts to a readable and functioning program.
