        if s=='(':
            #we expect a ')'

                tail = tail[1:]
                return check(s,tail)
            return False
        #we expect an '('
        if tail.startswith('('):
            tail = tail[1:]
            return check(s,tail)
        return False
    if len(lst)==1:
        return "No"
    s,tail = lst
    if check(s,tail):
        return "Yes"
    return "No"
#setup some test cases
tests = [(['()(', ')']), ['((', ')'), ('(', ')')], [')', ')']]
for case in tests:

``` 

To solve this problem, the provided Python script first defines a helper function `check` that takes in a current `string` and the `tail` of a string. The function then iterates through the `tail` and checks if the next character can match the current `string`. It does so by checking if the current `string` is an open parenthesis `(` and the next character in the `tail` is a close parenthesis `)`. If it matches, the `tail` is updated by removing the matched pair and recursively calls itself. If the `tail` is empty, it returns `True`. If the current `string` is a close parenthesis `)` and the `tail` starts with an open parenthesis `(`, it will result in a recursive call. If no matches are found, it returns `False`. 

The `match_parens` function first checks if the list has only one element, if so, it returns `No` since an odd number of parentheses will result in an unbalanced string. Otherwise, it takes the first element as the `string` and the second element as the `tail`. It then checks if the `tail` can be appended after the `string` by calling the `check` function. If it can, it returns `Yes`; otherwise, it returns `No`. 

The script also sets up some test cases and prints the actual and expected outputs for each test case. 

To better understand the code, here is a breakdown of the logic: 
1. If the list has only one element, it is not possible to create a balanced string, so return 'No'.
2. If the list has exactly two elements, check if the first element can be paired with the second element. If it can, return 'Yes'; otherwise, return 'No'.
3. If the list has more than two elements, it is possible to create a balanced string by combining the first and last element in the list, so return 'Yes'. 

This algorithm has a time complexity of `O(2^n)` where n is the number of elements in the list, making it inefficient for large inputs. However, since the problem constraints entail a maximum of 1000 elements, this solution still falls within a manageable time frame.
