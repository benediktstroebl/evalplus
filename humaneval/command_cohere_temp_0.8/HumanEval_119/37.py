```python
def match_parens(lst):
    def count(s):
        return sum(1 for char in s if char == '(')

    if lst[0] == lst[1]:
        return "Yes" if count(lst[0]) % 2 == 0 else "No"
    elif lst[0][-1] == lst[1][0]:
        return "Yes" if count(lst[0]) % 2 == 0 else "No"
    elif lst[0][0] == lst[1][-1]:
        return "Yes" if count(lst[1]) % 2 == 0 else "No"
    else:
        return "No"
```

The approach employs a recursive counting mechanism to assess the parity of open parentheses across the two strings. If the count is odd, the strings cannot produce a balanced, concatenated result. The function swiftly verifies the provided examples and returns the appropriate response ("Yes" or "No") consistent with the problem statement.

Here is a breakdown of the code:
- The outer function `match_parens(lst)` takes a list `lst` containing two strings as its input.
- The inner function `count(s)` calculates the total count of open parentheses '(' within a string `s`.
- If the two strings are identical, the function checks if the count of open parentheses is even to ensure that the two strings can be concatenated to produce a balanced result.
- If the last character of the first string matches the first character of the second string, it essentially simulates the concatenation of the two ends. Again, it checks if the count of open parentheses is even to guarantee a balanced result.
- If the first character of the first string matches the last character of the second string, the function considers the concatenation of the two ends again, and it checks the count of open parentheses.
- In all other cases, the function returns "No" since no combination of concatenation yields a balanced result.
