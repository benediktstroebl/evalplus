```python
def match_parens(lst):
    def shift(s):
        if not balance[s]:
            balance[s] = 1
        else:
            balance[s] += 1
            
    def pop(s):
        if not balance[s]:
            return False
        else:
            balance[s] -= 1
            if not balance[s]:
                del balance[s]
            return True
            
    balance = {}
    for s in lst:
        shift(s)
    for s in lst:
        if all(map(pop, balance)):
            return "Yes"
    return "No"
```

The following is a breakdown of the code:
1. The code utilizes a dictionary called `balance` to track the balance of parentheses for each string.
2. In the first pass, it uses the `shift` function to increment the balance of each string in the input list.
3. In the second pass, it checks if the balance of every string is zero and removes the key-value pair if it is indeed zero.
4. If after the second pass, all key-value pairs have been removed, this implies that there is a combination of the strings that results in a balanced and valid output. Otherwise, there isn't, and we return "No" or "Yes" respectively.
