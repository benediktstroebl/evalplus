```python
def match_parens(lst):
    def check(s, arr):
        cnt = [0] * 2
        for ch in s:
            cnt[ch == '('] += 1
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            cnt[arr[i]] -= 1
        return all(cnt[i] >= 0 for i in range(2))
    
    arr = list(zip(*lst))
    arr.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    return 'Yes' if check(''.join(arr[0]), arr[1]) else 'No'
```

The previous code defines the function `match_parens` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a string indicating whether the corresponding parentheses can be matched. The function relies on a helper function `check` that takes a string s and a list of parentheses counts arr. The function counts the number of open and closed parentheses and verifies if the counts are non-negative once all the open parentheses are closed and vice versa. The function returns true if the counts are correct, and false otherwise. The main function takes a list of strings, zips them into pairs, sorts them based on the first element of each pair (which is the direction of sorting), and checks whether the parentheses of the first element can be matched with those in the second element. If they can, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".
