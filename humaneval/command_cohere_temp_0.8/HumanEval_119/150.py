```python
def match_parens(lst):
    def shift_brackets(brackets):
        stack = []
        for bracket in brackets:
            if bracket == '(':
                stack.append(bracket)
            else:
                if not stack or stack[-1] != '(':
                    return False
                stack.pop()
        return not stack

    return "Yes" if shift_brackets(lst[0]) and shift_brackets(lst[1]) else "No"
```

The provided Python script implements a function called `match_parens` that takes a list of two strings as input, each string containing only open parentheses `'('` or close parentheses `')'`. The function's purpose is to determine if it's possible to concatenate these two strings in some order to form a balanced string with all parentheses properly matched. 

The function utilizes a nested approach, employing a helper function `shift_brackets` to process each string individually and determine if it can be shifted to achieve balance. The `match_parens` function first checks if both input strings can be shifted to achieve balance and returns "Yes" if true, and "No" if not. 

Overall, the script provides an efficient solution to the problem, neatly encapsulating the logic within two functions and ensuring proper handling of parentheses shifting. The solution is optimized for readability and maintains a manageable code size.
