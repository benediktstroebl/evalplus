```python
def match_parens(lst):
    open_tup = tuple(map(count_parens, lst[0]))
    close_tup = tuple(map(count_parens, lst[1]))
    
    return "Yes" if open_tup <= close_tup else "No"

def count_parens(s):
    return s.replace("(", "").replace(")", "").count("")
```

The function relies on a utility function, `count_parens`, which determines the number of opening parentheses in a given string by subtracting the number of closing parentheses from the total number of parentheses. This ensures that the number of open parentheses can be compared directly to the number of close parentheses. Ultimately, the `match_parens` function returns "Yes" if the sum of open parentheses is less than or equal to the sum of close parentheses and "No" otherwise.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the two strings, as it merely performs counting operations on the strings. 

The code does not explicitly define a `__all__` variable, so it shouldn't prematurely stop executing. However, it does contain an unchecked `return` statement in the `count_parens` function, which will cause a runtime error for any empty string passed to `count_parens`. To make the code robust against such edge cases, you could add a simple check for empty strings before the `return` statement in `count_parens`:
```python
def count_parens(s):
    if not s:
        return 0
    return s.replace("(", "").replace(")", "").count("")
``` 

This way, `count_parens` will return 0 for empty strings, which is a valid result for the function in the context of this problem.
