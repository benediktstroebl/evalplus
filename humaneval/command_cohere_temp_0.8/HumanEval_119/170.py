```python
def match_parens(lst):
    open_ptr = 0
    for char in lst[1]:
        if char == '(':
            open_ptr += 1
        elif char == ')':
            open_ptr -= 1
        if open_ptr < 0:
            return "No"
    if open_ptr == 0:
        return "Yes"
    else:
        return "No"
```

The script uses a simple `sliding window` approach, where the `open_ptr` variable keeps track of the open parentheses count in the current window (i.e., the second string). When iterating through the string, if we encounter an open parenthesis, we increment `open_ptr`, and when we encounter a close parenthesis, we decrement it. If at any point the `open_ptr` drops below zero, this means an unbalanced section was encountered, and accordingly, we return "No".

After processing the second string, if the `open_ptr` is still zero, this indicates a balanced section was found throughout the string, and we return "Yes". If it's not zero, this indicates an imbalance, and we return "No".

The solution is quite efficient, with time complexity `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the second string. This is because we need to scan the string only once to compute the count of open parentheses.
