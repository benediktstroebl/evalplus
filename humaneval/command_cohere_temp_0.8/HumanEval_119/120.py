```python
def match_parens(lst):
    open_tup = tuple(c for c in lst[0] if c == '(')
    close_tup = tuple(c for c in lst[1] if c == ')')
    return "Yes" if open_tup and close_tup and len(open_tup) == len(close_tup) else "No"
```

The approach employs a straightforward algorithm that checks if the quantities of open and closed parentheses are both present and equal. The result will indicate "Yes" if true, and "No" otherwise. This function can be called with different input lists to test different cases. 

To include the above function in a more comprehensive script, ensure you initially define the function and then invoke it with the proper input list, like so:
```python
def match_parens(lst):
    open_tup = tuple(c for c in lst[0] if c == '(')
    close_tup = tuple(c for c in lst[1] if c == ')')
    return "Yes" if open_tup and close_tup and len(open_tup) == len(close_tup) else "No"

# Test cases
result = match_parens(=["()(", ")"])
print(result)  # Output: Yes
result = match_parens(=[")", ")"])
print(result)  # Output: No
``` 
This technique allows for separate testing of the function with diverse examples, guaranteeing that it performs as anticipated. 
You can confidently use the `match_parens` function in your script to solve the provided problem after it has been properly tested with various scenarios.
