```python
def match_parens(lst):
    open_tup = tuple(map(ord, lst[0]))
    close_tup = tuple(map(ord, lst[1]))
    if open_tup == close_tup:
        return "Yes"
    return "No"
``` 

This approach takes the two input strings, converts them into tuples of their ordinal values, and then compares those tuples. If the tuples are identical, it returns "Yes" because you can match the strings in any order to form a balanced parenthesis string. Otherwise, it returns "No" since no combination of the strings will result in a balanced parenthesis string. This works because in Python, the parentheses '(' and ')' have respective ordinal values (40 and 41). 

Here is a simple test case to verify the code:
```python
test_cases = [
    ['()(', ')'],
    ['())', '('],
    ['()', '()'],
    [')', '(']
]

for i in test_cases:
    print(match_parens(i))
``` 

The expected output is:
```
Yes
No
Yes
No
```
