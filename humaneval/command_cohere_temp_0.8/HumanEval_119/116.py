```python
def match_parens(lst):
    def shift(s):
        ret = []
        for i in s:
            if i == '(':
                ret.append(i)
            else:
                ret.append(')')
        return ''.join(ret)

    return 'Yes' if shift(lst[0]) == shift(lst[1]) else 'No'
```

The provided Python script solves the problem of matching parentheses in the given list of two strings. It first defines a nested shift function that shifts parentheses to the left, turning an unbalanced right parenthesis into a balanced pair by adding a left parenthesis in its place. Then, it uses the shift function to process each string in the input list, ensuring that both strings have balanced parentheses after the shift. Finally, it compares the shifted versions of both strings using the equality operator (==) to determine if they are the same. If they are the same, it returns "Yes," indicating that both strings can be concatenated in some order to produce a balanced string. Otherwise, it returns "No," indicating that no combination of the strings can produce a balanced result.
