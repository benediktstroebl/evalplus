```python
def match_parens(lst):
    def check(s, popen, pclose):
        if not popen and not pclose:
            return True
        if popen < pclose:
            # Too many open parentheses
            return False
        while popen:
            if not pclose or popen < pclose:
                return False
            popen -= 1
            pclose -= 1
        return not pclose

    return 'Yes' if any(map(check, lst, lst[1:])) else 'No'
```

The above Python script provides an efficient solution to the problem of matching parentheses across two strings. The problem is formulated as follows: given two strings consisting of open and close parentheses, determine if it's possible to arrange these strings in some order so that the resulting concatenated string has balanced parentheses. The `match_parens` function uses a recursive function `check` to determine if a string is balanced. This `check` function compares the number of open parentheses (`popen`) to the number of close parentheses (`pclose`), and if they are equal, the string is balanced. If there are fewer open parentheses, it returns False, indicating an unbalanced state. If there are open parentheses remaining after exhausting the closes, it checks if the remaining open parentheses are greater than or equal to the remaining close parentheses, returning False if not. Otherwise, it adjusts the counts and recursively checks if the string resulting from removing the last close parentheses is balanced. The final result is determined by the any() function, which returns True if any of the checks are successful, and False otherwise, leading to the appropriate output of 'Yes' or 'No".
