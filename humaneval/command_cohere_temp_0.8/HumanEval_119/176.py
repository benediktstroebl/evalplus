```python
def match_parens(lst):
    # use a counter to track the number of open parentheses
    open_cnt = 0
    for char in lst[0]:
        if char == '(':
            open_cnt += 1
        elif char == ')':
            open_cnt -= 1
        if open_cnt < 0:
            return "No"
    lst[0] = ''.join(lst[0])
    lst[1] = ''.join(lst[1])
    if open_cnt != 0:
        return "No"
    return "Yes"
```

The provided Python script defines a function `match_parens` that takes a list `lst` as input, specifically two strings consisting of open parentheses `'('` or close parentheses `')'`. The function aims to determine if it's possible to concatenate these two strings in some order to form a balanced string, i.e., a string with correctly matched parentheses.

To achieve this, the function employs a counter to keep track of the number of open parentheses encountered while iterating through the characters of the first string. If at any point the counter falls below zero, it means there are more close parentheses than open ones, and the function returns "No" immediately, indicating that a balanced string cannot be formed.

Both input strings are then normalized by converting them into strings (instead of lists of characters), and if the counter indicates an odd number of open parentheses at the end, it means there's an imbalance, so the function returns "No" again.

If the counter is zero at the end, it signifies that the string can be balanced by pairing the appropriate number of open and close parentheses. Therefore, the function returns "Yes" to indicate that a way exists to form a good string.
