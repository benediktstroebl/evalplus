The provided code first constructs a tree where each element in the list is a node, and internal nodes indicate the "(" symbol, whereas leaf nodes indicate ")" symbols. It employs a recursive function `shift_tree` that shifts the tree to the left or right, depending on whether the current node is an "L" or an "R". The root node is the list `[lst[0],lst[1],'(']'. The function then checks if it's possible to balance the tree by shifting its nodes, and if so, it returns "Yes". If there is more than one candidate list, it also checks if any of them can be balanced, and if so, it returns "Yes". 

This solution enables the algorithm to solve the problem in a concise and efficient manner.
