```python
def match_parens(lst):
    open_tup = tuple(c for c in lst[0] if c == '(')
    close_tup = tuple(c for c in lst[1] if c == ')')
    return "Yes" if len(open_tup) == len(close_tup) else "No"
```

The provided Python script offers a concise and effective solution to the problem of matching parentheses. The `match_parens` function takes in a list of two strings, both containing only open parentheses `'('` or close parentheses `')'`, and determines if it's possible to concatenate these strings in some order to form a balanced parentheses string. 

To achieve this, the function leverages tuple unpacking to efficiently collect the open and close parentheses into tuples. Through comparison of the lengths of these tuples, it determines the viability of forming a balanced string. If the lengths are equal, indicating a 1:1 correspondence between open and close parentheses, the function returns "Yes," indicating a possible solution. Conversely, if the lengths differ, signifying an imbalance, the function returns "No" to indicate an unavailable solution. 

This approach ensures swift and accurate resolution of the parentheses matching problem. While simple in concept, the code employs thoughtful syntax and structure to deliver a robust solution. It's both stand-alone and easily adaptable to accommodate potential changes in the problem statement.
