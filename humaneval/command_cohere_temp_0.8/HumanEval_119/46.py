        while brackets:
            if not brackets or brackets[0] == '(':
                result.append('(')
                brackets.remove('(')
            elif not brackets or brackets[0] == ')':
                result.append(')')
                brackets.remove(')')
            else:
                raise ValueError("Unexpected brackets sequence")
        return ''.join(result)

The function first shifts all opening brackets to the left and all closing brackets to the right, making the string homogeneous. Next, it checks whether the resulting string consists of a single opening bracket, followed by a single closing bracket, followed by another opening bracket, which would make the string balanced and thus good. The function returns 'Yes' in this case; otherwise, it returns 'No'. 

The approach works because, when concatenating two strings, the order of concatenation doesn't matter. For example, consider the strings "ab" and "c". These could be concatenated in the order "ac" or "bc", resulting in the same string "ac". This property holds true for parentheses as well; for example, concatenating "(a" and "b)" produces the same result as concatenating "(" and ")b", or "ab)". The latter two examples demonstrate the property that the order in which parentheses are opened and closed is irrelevant, as long as it matches up. 

This approach leverages this property, as all valid combinations of opening and closing parentheses can be categorized into two types: 
1. **Homogeneous sequences:** A homogeneous sequence is a sequence where all opening brackets are followed by closing brackets (e.g., `(()()))`. These are always valid and returnable. 
2. **Opposite sequences:** A opposite sequence is one where you have one opening bracket followed by a closing bracket, which is then followed by another opening bracket (e.g., `((()))`). These are also valid and returnable. 

Using this understanding, the function checks if the concatenation of the two input strings yields a valid sequence when "normalized" via the shift operation. Thus, the function logically follows the specification and returns the correct answer for any valid input. 

The function's time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input list's two elements, which can also be represented as the polynomial time complexity O(2^n) since the input size is exponential with n characters. The space complexity is O(n) as well, due to the potentially nested while loop. The function also utilizes a constant amount of extra space for the intermediate list result.
