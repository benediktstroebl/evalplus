```python
def match_parens(lst):
    return 'Yes' if max(lst, key=len) in ['()', '()'] else 'No'
```

The Python script provides a self-contained function called `match_parens` that takes a list of strings as input, specifically two strings, both containing only opening or closing parentheses. The function checks if it's possible to concatenate these strings in some order to form a balanced parentheses string. Balanced parentheses are those where the number of opening parentheses is equal to the number of closing parentheses. The function returns "Yes" if such a concatenation is possible, indicating that one of the strings has a single opening parenthesis, and the other has an equal number of opening and closing parentheses. It returns "No" otherwise, implying that both strings have different lengths and neither is a valid opening or closing pair on its own, preventing a balanced concatenation. 

The logic is centered around the concept of balancing parentheses in a string, which is a common problem in programming interviews. The function leverages the fact that a maximum string from the input list, identified using the len attribute, which is key in this solution, will be a valid opening or closing pair, and thus provides a concise and efficient solution to the problem.
