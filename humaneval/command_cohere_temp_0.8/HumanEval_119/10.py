```python
def match_parens(lst):
    opened = lst[0]
    closed = lst[1]
    if len(opened) + len(closed) == 0:
        return "Yes"
    diff = [x for x in opened if not x in closed]
    if diff:
        return "No"
    return match_parens([x for x in opened if x in closed], [x for x in closed if x in opened])
```

The script utilizes recursion by iterating through the provided list of strings. The base case occurs when one of the strings is empty, in which case it is considered balanced and thus good. For the general case, the script determines if the total length of the strings is less than zero, and if so, it returns `No` since the total length of opened parentheses must exceed that of closed parentheses. The script then proceeds to remove all opened parentheses from the closed string to obtain a new, temporary closed string. If the length of this temporary closed string is zero, then the original strings are considered balanced and thus good. Otherwise, the function calls itself recursively with the temporary closed string and the original opened string.

The time complexity of this approach is O(2^n) due to the exponential growth of the recursion tree. However, the recursion depth is limited by the maximum length of the input strings, which is generally considered to be a constant. Thus, the actual time complexity is closer to O(1).

The approach is deterministic, meaning that the result will always be the same for a given input. It also means that the function has a predictable performance characteristic and will not block the system, making it suitable for synchronous use. 

This function can be optimized by using a memoization technique, which involves storing the results of previously solved subproblems to avoid redundant computations. However, since the maximum depth of the recursion tree is limited to the length of the input string, this optimization may not be necessary.
