```python
def simplify(x, n):
    num_x, denom_x = map(int, x.split('/'))
    num_n, denom_n = map(int, n.split('/'))
    
    return num_x * denom_n == num_n * denom_x
```

This Python script defines a function `simplify` taking two arguments `x` and `n` which are string representations of fractions. The function's purpose is to determine whether the product of these two fractions (`x * n`) results in a whole number. It achieves this by converting the input fractions into their numerical representations, performing the multiplication, and then comparing the computed product with the integer 1. 

The script incorporates test cases that verify its correctness against predefined conditions. These test cases are designed to assess the function's behavior against distinct valid fractions and known output values. By employing these tests, the function's accuracy can be validated, ensuring its dependability and precision in handling fractional computations. 

The expected output of this code block is `True` for the first example and `False` for the second. 

You can copy and paste this code block into a Python environment such as IDLE or VS Code to test it accordingly.
