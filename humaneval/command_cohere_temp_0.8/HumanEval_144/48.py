```python
def simplify(x, n):
    num_x, den_x = map(int, x.split('/'))
    num_n, den_n = map(int, n.split('/'))
    return num_x * num_n % den_n == 0
```

The function `simplify()` takes two arguments, `x` and `n`, which are strings representing fractions in the format `<numerator>/<denominator>`. It splits these strings into numerators and denominators and then calculates the product of the numerators and the remainder of this product divided by the denominator. If the remainder is zero, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

This implementation assumes that the input fractions are valid and do not have zero as the denominator. You can add input validation tests if these assumptions change. 

The provided examples in the problem statement all have their expected output included. You can verify that the function `simplify()` correctly solves the problem by running these examples as tests:
```python
assert simplify("1/5", "5/1") == True
assert simplify("1/6", "2/1") == False
assert simplify("7/10", "10/2") == False
```
