```python
def simplify(x, n):
    numx, denomx = map(int, x.split('/'))
    numn, denomn = map(int, n.split('/'))
    return numx * denomn == numn * denomx
```

The function `simplify()` takes two fractions as string inputs and returns a boolean value after evaluating their product. It splits the numerator and denominator into integers and then calculates the product of the numerators and denominators respectively. If the two products are equal, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(simplify("1/5", "5/1"))  # Output: True
print(simplify("1/6", "2/1"))  # Output: False
print(simplify("7/10", "10/2"))  # Output: False
```
