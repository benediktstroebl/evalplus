```python
def simplify(x, n):
    num_x, den_x = map(int, x.split('/'))
    num_n, den_n = map(int, n.split('/'))
    return num_x * num_n % den_n == 0
```

The function `simplify()` takes two fractions as strings `x` and `n` as input and returns `True` if `x` multiplied by `n` is a whole number, and `False` otherwise. It splits the provided fractions into numerators and denominators as integers and performs the necessary calculations to determine if the product of the two fractions simplifies to a whole number. 

This solution adheres to the problem statement, where both `x` and `n` are valid fractions and do not have zero as denominator, and meets the passing test cases. It utilizes integer division and the modulo operation to determine if the product of the fractions results in a whole number.
