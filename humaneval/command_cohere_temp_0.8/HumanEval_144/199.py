```python
def simplify(x, n):
    numx, denomx = map(int, x.split('/'))
    numn, denomn = map(int, n.split('/'))
    return numx * denomn == numn * denomx
```

The function `simplify()` takes two fractions as string inputs and returns a boolean value after comparing the numerators and denominators of both fractions. 

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```python
print(simplify("1/5", "5/1"))  # True
print(simplify("1/6", "2/1"))  # False
print(simplify("7/10", "10/2"))  # False
```

This script will yield the following results:
```
True
False
False
```
