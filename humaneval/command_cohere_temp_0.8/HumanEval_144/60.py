```python
def simplify(x, n):
    numx, denomx = map(int, x.split('/'))
    numn, denomn = map(int, n.split('/'))
    return numx * denomn == numn * denomx
```

The function `simplify()` takes two fractions as strings `x` and `n` as input and returns `True` if `x * n` is a whole number (or, in other words, if the product of the numerators is equal to the product of the denopers), and `False` otherwise.

To solve the problem, the following steps are needed:
1. Split the strings `x` and `n` at the '/' character. This assumes that the fractions are in the format `<numerator>/<denominator>`.
2. Convert the resulting numerator and denominator for both fractions to integers using `map(int, ...)`. 
3. Return `True` if `numx * denomn == numn * denomx`, and `False` otherwise.

The precondition is that `x` and `n` are strings that represent valid fractions in the format `<numerator>/<denominator>`, where both the numerator and denominator are positive whole numbers, and the denominators are not zero. The postcondition is that if `x * n` evaluates to a whole number, the function should return `True`, and if not, it should return `False`.

This solution is efficient and less than `O(N)` time complexity, as it involves simple operations like splitting the string and multiplying the integers, which are both constant time operations.

Note: The tests assume that the input fractions have valid formats and that the function is meant to handle the simplified product of fractions, not the product of the simplified fractions. Thus, for example, it expects that `simplify("1/5", "5/1")` is correctedly evaluated as `True`, and not `False`.  if simplifying individually, the result would be `"1/1"`.  This could be another puzzle, on its own right.
