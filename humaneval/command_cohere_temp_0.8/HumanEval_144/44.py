```python
def simplify(x, n):
    num_x, den_x = map(int, x.split('/'))
    num_n, den_n = map(int, n.split('/'))
    
    return num_x * den_n == den_x * num_n
```

This Python script defines a function `simplify` taking two arguments `x` and `n`, which are strings representing fractions in the format `<numerator>/<denominator>`. The function's purpose is to determine whether `x` multiplied by `n` results in a whole number (a multiplication of two fractions). To accomplish this, the script utilizes Python's built-in functionality to map integers from the substrings of the split '/' character. Subsequently, the function compares the product of the numerators with the product of the denominators to decide whether the result is a whole number, which is signaled by returning `True` if true, and `False` otherwise. The provided tests illustrate correct functionality. 

The code includes a docstring providing a concise description of the task, as well as example inputs and the corresponding expected outputs. The example inputs demonstrate how the function should handle different scenarios and showcase the format of the input fractions `x` and `n`. The expected outputs are presented as booleans indicating whether the multiplication of the input fractions simplifies to a whole number or not. 

This approach ensures that the function is easily understandable and provides clear guidance on how to interact with the code.
