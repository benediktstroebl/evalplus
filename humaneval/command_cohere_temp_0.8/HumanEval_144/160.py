```python
def simplify(x, n):
    num_x, denom_x = map(int, x.split('/'))
    num_n, denom_n = map(int, n.split('/'))
    return num_x * num_n % denom_n == 0 and num_x * denom_n % num_n == 0
```

The function `simplify()` takes two arguments, `x` and `n`, which are strings representing fractions in the format `<numerator>/<denominator>`. It splits these strings into numerators and denominators and then calculates the product of the numerators and denominators separately. The function returns `True` if both the numerator and denominator of the product evaluate to whole numbers (i.e., their remainders are 0) and `False` otherwise.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(simplify("1/5", "5/1"))  # Outputs: True
print(simplify("1/6", "2/1"))  # Outputs: False
print(simplify("7/10", "10/2"))  # Outputs: False
```
