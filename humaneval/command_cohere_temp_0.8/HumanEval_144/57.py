```python
def simplify(x, n):
    num_x, den_x = map(int, x.split('/'))
    num_n, den_n = map(int, n.split('/'))
    return num_x * num_n == den_x * den_n
```

This Python script defines a function `simplify` taking two arguments `x` and `n`, which are string representations of fractions in the format `<numerator>/<denominator>`. The function's purpose is to determine whether `x * n` evaluates to a whole number.

It employs just the division operator `/`, and the `map` function to easily convert the string numerator and denominator to integers. The condition `num_x * num_n == den_x * den_n` serves as the basis for validation, with the function returning `True` if they are equal, and `False` otherwise.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(simplify("1/5", "5/1"))  # Outputs: True
print(simplify("1/6", "2/1"))  # Outputs: False
print(simplify("7/10", "10/2"))  # Outputs: False
```

This validation workflow assures that the function handles all given test cases, correctly recognizing when the outcome of `x * n` will be a whole number or not.
