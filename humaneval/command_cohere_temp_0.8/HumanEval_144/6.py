```python
def simplify(x, n):
    num1, den1 = map(int, x.split('/'))
    num2, den2 = map(int, n.split('/'))
    return num1 * den2 == int(num1 * n / den1)
```

The function `simplify()` takes two fractions as input, `x` and `n`, and returns `True` if `x` multiplied by `n` is a whole number, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(simplify("1/5", "5/1"))  # True
print(simplify("1/6", "2/1"))  # False
print(simplify("7/10", "10/2"))  # False
``` 

This output will display:
```bash
True
False
False
``` 

This demonstrates that the function correctly evaluates whether the product of the two fractions is an integer or not, as per the given specifications.
