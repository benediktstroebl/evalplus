```python
def simplify(x, n):
    num1, denom1 = map(int, x.split('/'))
    num2, denom2 = map(int, n.split('/'))
    return num1 * denom2 == num2 * denom1
```

The function `simplify` takes two arguments, `x` and `n`, which are strings representing fractions in the format `<numerator>/<denominator>`. They are split into their numerators and denominators and then converted to integers using the `map` function, to allow for comparison. 

The function then compares the product of the numerators and denominators of the two fractions to determine if the result is a whole number or not, and returns `True` or `False` accordingly.

This solution is based on the problem statement and assumes the validity of the fractions provided, as stated in the assumptions of the problem. 

This approach assumes that the input strings are valid fractions and closely follows the problem statement guidelines. Feel free to ask if you would like any clarification or additional assistance!
