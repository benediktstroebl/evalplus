```python
def simplify(x, n):
    num_x = map(int, x.split('/'))
    num_n = map(int, n.split('/'))
    return num_x[0] * num_n[0] % 1 == 0
```

The function `simplify()` takes two arguments, `x` and `n`, which are strings representing fractions in the format `<numerator>/<denominator>`. It splits these strings into numerators and denominators and then checks if the product of the numerators and denominators, when converted to floating-point numbers, equals exactly 1. If this condition is satisfied, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

This approach takes advantage of the fact that, due to floating-point arithmetic, the product of any integer fraction with denominator D and any fraction with denominator D will eventually converge to a repeating decimal of Darwinian ratio 1/D. Therefore, if this decimal has a finite number of digits after the decimal point, it must equal 1.
