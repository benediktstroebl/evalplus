Here's the Python code to solve the problem:
```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    characters_set = set(string.lower())
    return len(characters_set)
```
This function uses a set data structure to remove duplicate characters, regardless of case, and then counts the number of remaining characters to return the answer.
