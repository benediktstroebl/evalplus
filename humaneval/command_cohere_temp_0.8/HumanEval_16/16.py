Here's the Python code with a self-contained function `count_distinct_characters` that solves the problem:
```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    characters = set(string.lower())
    return len(characters)
```
This function uses a set to store the distinct characters in the string after converting all characters to lowercase. This ensures that characters like 'x' and 'X' are treated as the same entity and only their count is calculated. Finally, the length of the set, which is the number of distinct characters, is returned.
