Here's a Python script that contains a function related to the task stated in the code block:
```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    characters = set(string.lower())
    return len(characters)
```
This function uses a set to store the distinct characters in the string after converting all characters to lowercase. The `lower()` method is used to turn a string to lowercase. A set is a collection of unique values, counting the number of elements in the set gives the number of distinct characters in the string. 

The test cases provided in the code block pass successfully with this function. You can use this code to solve the problem or adapt it to your needs. Let me know if you would like to elaborate or add more details to this solution.
