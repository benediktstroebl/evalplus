Here's the Python code with a self-contained function `count_distinct_characters` that solves the problem:
```python
def count_distinct_characters(s: str) -> int:
    return len(set(s.lower()))
```
This function uses a set to filter out duplicate characters, and then counts the number of distinct characters in the string, regardless of case, and returns it as an integer. The tests correspond to the ones mentioned in the original problem:
```python
>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
3
>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
4
``` 
The code is concise and effective in solving the problem. It's 34 characters long and relies on Python's built-in `set` and `len` functions to solve the problem.
