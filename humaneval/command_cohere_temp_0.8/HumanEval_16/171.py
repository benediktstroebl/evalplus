Here's the Python code with a self-contained function `count_distinct_characters` that solves the problem:
```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    characters = set(string.lower())
    return len(characters)
```
This function uses a set to store the distinct characters in the string after converting all characters to lowercase. This ensures that characters like 'x' and 'X' are treated as the same character. Finally, it returns the length of the set, which is the number of distinct characters.

To demonstrate its usage, we include a test suite with one test case and a 'python -m unittest' execution style:
```python
def test_count_distinct_characters():
    """ Test the correctness of the function """
    assert count_distinct_characters("xyzXYZ") == 3
    assert count_distinct_characters("Jerry") == 4

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

When executed, this script runs the test suite and verifies the function's correctness against the given test cases.
