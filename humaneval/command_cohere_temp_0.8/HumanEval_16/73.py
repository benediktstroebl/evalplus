Here's the Python code to solve the problem:
```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    characters_set = set(string.lower())
    return len(characters_set)
```
This function uses a set data structure to remove duplicate characters, regardless of case, and then counts the number of distinct characters in the set to return as the answer. It handles both upper and lower case as intended.
