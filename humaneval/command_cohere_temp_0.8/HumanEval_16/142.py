Here's the Python code to solve the problem:
```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    characters = set(string.lower())
    return len(characters)
```
This code defines a function, `count_distinct_characters`, which takes a string as an argument and uses a set data structure to store the unique characters in the string, regardless of case, and returns the count of distinct characters.
