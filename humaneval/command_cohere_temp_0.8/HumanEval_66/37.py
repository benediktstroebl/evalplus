```python
def digitSum(s):
    return sum(map(int, s.upper()))
```
This Python script defines a function called digitSum that takes a string s as input. Inside the function, it uses the sum function in combination with the map function to convert each character in the input string to its corresponding numeric value (ASCII code). The result is the sum of these numeric values, representing the sum of the upper characters' ASCII codes. The key is that this is evaluated on the uppercased string, so a lowercase 'a' (97) and an uppercase 'A' (65) contribute 65 to the total, making this a more interesting problem than simply summing digits. 
The expected output for various inputs is summarized below:
```
digitSum("") => 0
digitSum("abAB") => 131
digitSum("abcCd") => 67
digitSum("helloE") => 69
digitSum("woArBld") => 131
digitSum("aAaaaXa") => 153
```
