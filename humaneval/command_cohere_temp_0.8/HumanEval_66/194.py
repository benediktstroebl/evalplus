```python
def digitSum(s):
    return sum(map(int, list(filter(str.isdigit, s))))
```

The function digitSum takes a string s as input and uses the sum function to calculate the sum of the upper characters only' ASCII codes. The map function is used to convert each character in the string to its corresponding ASCII code, and the filter function is used to remove any non-digit characters from the string.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(digitSum("abAB"))
```
```
131
```

This would output: 131, as the sum of the ASCII codes for the upper characters in the string "abAB", which are 97 + 66 + 43 = 131.

This problem can be solved using string manipulation:
```python
def digitSum(s):
    return sum(c.isdigit() * ord(c) for c in s)
```

Here the iteratee in the sum function is a generator expression that evaluates truthy for digit characters and assigns the corresponding ASCII value.
