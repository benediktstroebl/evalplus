```python
def is_simple_power(x, n):
    return type(n) is int and x == n ** int(x == n ** x)
```

The provided code defines a Python function called `is_simple_power` that checks whether a given number `x` is a simple power of `n`. It returns `True` if `x` is a simple power of `n` and `False` otherwise. The function corroborates two conditions:
1. Whether the `type(n)` is `int`, ensuring that the second argument `n` is an integer.
2. If `x` is equal to `n` raised to the power of the integer value obtained from evaluating `x == n**x`. This verifies if `x` can be written as `n^int` for some integer value. 

The function returns the result of this comparison, effectively determining whether `x` is a simple power of `n` if both conditions are met, returning `True`, and `False` in any other case. 

This solution is self-contained within the function and does not require any external variables or dependencies. It can be successfully run as a standalone Python script to test different input cases.
