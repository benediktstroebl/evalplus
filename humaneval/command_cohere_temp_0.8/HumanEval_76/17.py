```python
def is_simple_power(x, n):
    return type(n) is int and x == n ** int(x == n ** x)
```

The provided code defines a Python function called `is_simple_power` that checks whether a given number `x` is a simple power of `n`. It returns `True` if `x` is a simple power of `n` and `False` otherwise. The function first checks if `n` is an integer and if `x` is equal to `n` raised to the power of itself, which indicates a simple power relationship. The condition `x == n ** int(x == n ** x)` may seem complex, but it simplifies the testing process by directly checking if `x` is equal to `n` raised to the power of `x` and also ensures that `n` is an integer. The function returns `True` if this condition is met, indicating that `x` is a simple power of `n`. This approach provides an efficient way to determine simple power relationships between numbers.
