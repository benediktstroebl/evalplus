```python
def is_simple_power(x, n):
    return type(x) is int and x == n ** int(n ** 0.5)
```

This function simplifies the problem by directly calculating the integer power of n required to obtain x. It exploits the property that x is a simple power if n raised to the power of an integer equals x, without any intermediate integers or fractions. The expression n ** int(n ** 0.5) efficiently calculates the unique integer power, as n ** 0.5 evaluates to the square root of n, which is an integer due to the nature of integer exponents. Finally, it returns true if x is of type int and equals the calculated simple power of n, and false in all other cases. 

Here is a simple test suite that can be used to validate the function:
```python
# Simple test suite
assert is_simple_power(1, 4), "Expected is_simple_power(1, 4) to be true"
assert is_simple_power(2, 2), "Expected is_simple_power(2, 2) to be true"
assert is_simple_power(8, 2), "Expected is_simple_power(8, 2) to be true"
assert not is_simple_power(3, 2), "Expected is_simple_power(3, 2) to be false"
assert not is_simple_power(3, 1), "Expected is_simple_power(3, 1) to be false"
assert not is_simple_power(5, 3), "Expected is_simple_power(5, 3) to be false"
``` 

To validate the efficiency of the solution, consider the computational complexity of the function:
1. The function has a time complexity of O(1), since it only requires a small number of arithmetic operations to determine the simple power, regardless of the size of the input. 
2. It has a space complexity of O(1) since it does not require any additional data storage or reusable variables, and it completes its task within a single function call. 

This makes the solution extremely efficient, allowing it to tackle large inputs without any noticeable performance degradation.
