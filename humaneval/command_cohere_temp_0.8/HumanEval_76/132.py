```python
def is_simple_power(x, n):
    return type(n) is int and x == n ** int(x == n ** x)
```

The provided code defines a Python function `is_simple_power` that checks whether a given number `x` is a simple power of `n`. It returns `True` if `x` is a simple power of `n` and `False` otherwise. The function corroborates the following conditions:
- If the type of `n` is integer (`int`), confirming that `x` is essentially of the form `n^k` where `k` is an integer.
- Checking if `x` is equal to `n` raised to the power of the integer `k`, corroborates if `x` is a simple power of `n`.

In summary, the function employs a type check and utilizes the exponentiation operator to determine if `x` is a simple power of `n`. It returns `True` if `x` conforms to this pattern and `False` if it does not. 

This function can be used to efficaciously determine whether a number is a simple power of another in Python, benefiting various mathematical and computational applications.
