```python
def is_simple_power(x, n):
    return type(x) is int and x == n ** int(n ** x == x)
```

This function returns true if the number `x` is a simple power of `n` and false in all other cases. For example, it returns `True` for the inputs `1` and `4`, and `2` and `2`, but returns `False` for the inputs `3` and `2`, and `5` and `3`.

The code uses the type of `x` to narrow the scope of the problem. The function checks if `x` is an integer and if `x` is equal to `n` raised to the power of the integer value obtained by evaluating `n` to the power of `x`. The `type(x)` function is used to check if `x` is an integer, and the `**` operator is used to raise `n` to the power of `x`. The `int()` function is used to convert the result of `n**x` to an integer, which is then compared to `x` using the `==` operator.
