```python
def is_simple_power(x, n):
    return type(n) is int and x == n ** int(x == n ** x)
```

The function checks whether the number `x` is a simple power of `n` by using the following logic:
1. `type(n) is int`: This checks whether `n` is an integer. This is ensured to be true during the problem statement's examples.
2. `x == n ** int(x == n ** x)`: This condition checks three things simultaneously:
    - If `x` is a simple power of `n`. This is ensured by the equality `x == n ** int(x)`.
    - If `x` is equal to the integer `n` itself. This is checked by the equality `x == n`.
    - If `x == n ** x`: This indirectly ensures that `x` is an integer since otherwise the inequality would be `false`. 

The overall correctness of the function is ensured by And logic between the two conditions. 

The unit test for this function would be evaluating the function for different input values and verifying that the output is correct. Here is an example: 
```python
# Testing the function
print(is_simple_power(1, 4))  # True
print(is_simple_power(2, 2))  # True
print(is_simple_power(8, 2))  # True
print(is_simple_power(3, 2))  # False
print(is_simple_power(3, 1))  # False
print(is_simple_power(5, 3))  # False
``` 

The expected output of this test suite is:
```
True
True
True
False
False
```
