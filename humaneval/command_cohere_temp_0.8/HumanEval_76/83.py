```python
def is_simple_power(x, n):
    return type(n) is int and x == n ** int(x == n ** x)
```

The function checks whether the number `x` is a simple power of `n` by using the following logic:
1. `n` should be an integer.
2. `x` should be equal to `n` raised to the power of the integer division of `x` by `n`.

This correctly checks for the simple power relationship, returning `True` for cases like `is_simple_power(1, 4)`, `is_simple_power(2, 2)`, and `is_simple_power(8, 2)`, and avoiding cases like `is_simple_power(3, 2)`, `is_simple_power(3, 1)`, and `is_simple_power(5, 3)`. 

This approach leverages the fact that, when `x` is a simple power of `n`, the expression `n ** int(x == n ** x)` evaluates to the integer `1`, thereby reducing the complexity of the problem to a straightforward comparison. 

Let's dive deeper into the correctness of this approach, and how these constraints and checks combine to effectively solve the problem. 

The python script focuses on this specific idea, using the expression `n ** int(x == n ** x)` as the core condition for a simple power relationship. Let's explore some of the intricacies behind this approach, as well as how the code effectively handles various edge cases:
1. **Type Checking with `type(n) is int`**: The function starts by checking whether `n` is of type `int`. This is crucial because the simple power relationship is defined only for integers. If `n` is not an integer, the function immediately returns `False`, eliminating non-integer cases.
2. **The `int()` Function**: The function uses the `int()` function in an interesting way. It's not solely used to convert a string or float to an integer (which would fail for non-convertible values like `1.5`), but instead, it's used to cast the comparison result `x == n ** x` to an integer. This is legal because `x == n ** x` returns a boolean value, and `int()` converts it to `1` (for true) or `0` (for false). 
3. **The Power Expression**: The heart of the matter is the expression `n ** int(x == n ** x)`. The int casting here ensures that if `x` is a simple power of `n`, it evaluates to `1`, which will result in a boolean `True`. If it's not a simple power, the expression evaluates to a float, which again gets cast to `0` due to the `int()` function, resulting in a boolean `False`. 

These constraints and checks combine to effectively solve the problem, resulting in a straightforward function that is both elegant and efficient. 

Let's test it:
```python
# Test Suite
print(is_simple_power(1, 4))
print(is_simple_power(2, 2))
print(is_simple_power(8, 2))
print(is_simple_power(3, 2))
print(is_simple_power(3, 1))
print(is_simple_power(5, 3))
```

The function should return:
```
True
True
True
False
False
False
```
