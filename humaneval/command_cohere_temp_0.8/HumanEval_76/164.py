```python
def is_simple_power(x, n):
    return type(n) is int and x == n ** int(x == n ** x)
```

This function checks if the number `x` is a simple power of `n` by doing the following:
1. It first checks if the type of `n` is integer (not boolean or string) to ensure that the operation returns an integer result and handles potential numeric inputs like "3.14" correctly.
2. The function then compares `x` with `n` raised to the power of the integer value of `x == n ** x`. This checks if `x` is equal to `n` raised to the power of `x` and returns the result as a boolean.

The code is self-contained and does not rely on any external modules or assumptions about the interpreter's environment, it should work in any Python runtime. 
The function handles the simple power case with the int argument as described in the prompt and returns false for all other cases as specified in the prompt.

This should correctly solve the problem as stated in the markdown code block. Let me know if you would like to provide any additional feedback on the code or explain further how it solves the problem. Feel free to ask if you would like to discuss further or explore other coding problems you might be interested in.
