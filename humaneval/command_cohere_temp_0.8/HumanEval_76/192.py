```python
def is_simple_power(x, n):
    return type(n) is int and x == n ** int(x == n ** x)
```

The function checks whether the number `x` is a simple power of `n` by using the following logic:
1. `type(n) is int`: This checks whether `n` is an integer. This is to ensure that the result of integer exponentiation `n ** int` is again an integer and avoids unnecessary complexity when `n` is a floating-point number.
2. `x == n ** int(x == n ** x)`: This condition checks three things at once:
    - If `x` is not equal to `n` raised to the power of `x` (`n ** int(x)`), then it immediately returns `False`.
    - If `x` is equal to `n` raised to the power of `x`, it then checks if the result is equal to `x`. This is done to ensure that the result is not due to floating-point approximation and strictly equals the desired value.
    - The use of the `int` function within the exponentiation checks whether the result of `n ** x` is an integer, which is necessary for the equality to be considered true.

The code will evaluate to `True` for tests like `is_simple_power(1, 4)`, `is_simple_power(2, 2)`, and `is_simple_power(8, 2)`, whereas it will evaluate to `False` for tests like `is_simple_power(3, 2)`, `is_simple_power(3, 1)`, and `is_simple_power(5, 3)`.
