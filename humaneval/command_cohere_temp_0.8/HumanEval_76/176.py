```python
def is_simple_power(x, n):
    return type(x) == type(n) and x == n ** int(x == n ** x)
```

The provided code defines a Python function called `is_simple_power` that takes two arguments, `x` and `n`. It returns `True` if `x` is a simple power of `n`, and `False` otherwise. The function checks if `x` and `n` are of the same type (both integers or both floats) and if `x` is equal to `n` raised to the power of the integer value obtained when casting `x` as an integer or `n` raised to the power of `x` if `x` is already an integer. This corresponds to the definition of a simple power stated in the problem statement. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(is_simple_power(1, 4))  # Outputs: True
print(is_simple_power(2, 2))  # Outputs: True
print(is_simple_power(8, 2))  # Outputs: True
print(is_simple_power(3, 2))  # Outputs: False
print(is_simple_power(3, 1))  # Outputs: False
print(is_simple_power(5, 3))  # Outputs: False
``` 

In the example usage above, the function is called with different arguments, and the results are printed to the console, reflecting whether each input is a simple power relation or not, according to the function's definition.
