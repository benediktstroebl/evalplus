This script provides a function `int_to_mini_roman` that converts a given positive integer into its mini roman numeral representation as a string and returns it in lowercase. It uses a loop to iterate through numbers between 1000 and 1, generating the roman numeral representation and subtracting the counted value from the remaining number. It handles cases like `xix`, `clii`, `cdxxvi`, and others correctly. 

The code is structured and concise while maintaining readability. It also raises a `ValueError` for invalid inputs, ensuring the function's behavior aligns with the specified restrictions. 

This solution is tested and validated to work correctly for positive integers within the specified range of 1 to 1000. 
If you have any suggestions or questions about the code, feel free to let me know! Feel free to ask any follow-up questions or provide feedback on this improved solution; I'll be glad to discuss further and assist however I can!
