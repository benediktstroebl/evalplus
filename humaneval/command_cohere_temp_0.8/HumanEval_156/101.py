The provided code defines a function int_to_mini_roman that takes a single argument n, representing the target integer to be converted into its mini roman numeral representation. The function adheres to the specified constraints of handling integers between 1 and 1000.

The logic underpinning the function involves two primary steps:
1. Handling Thousands Formation:
The integer is first divided into thousands and the remainder using the divmod function. The resulting thousands value is tracked using the variable rom_thousands. A loop iterates through the thousands, appending an 'm' to the rom_thousands string for each thousands value.
2. Handling the Remainder:
The rest of the calculation focuses on converting the remaining integer (the remainder) into the roman numeral representation. This is achieved by iteratively dividing the remainder by 5 and collecting the roman numerals. The divmod function is used again to compute the quotient and the remainder in a loop, simulating the act of dividing. Based on the remainder, the appropriate roman numerals 'i', 'ii', 'iii', or 'iv' are appended to the rom_rest list.

Finally, the roman numerals for the thousands and the remainder are concatenated together, with the thousands followed by the remainder. The resulting string is returned, representing the roman numeral equivalent of the original integer in lowercase.

The code includes a docstring at the beginning of the function, providing a concise description of the problem and its constraints, along with example usage. This clarifies the function's purpose and how it is intended to be used.
