```python
def int_to_mini_roman(n):
    if n == 1:
        return "i"
    else:
        tens, rest = divmod(n, 10)
        if tens == 1:
            return f"{rest}x"
        elif tens > 1:
            return f"{tens}x{int_to_mini_roman(rest)}"
        else:
            return f"{rest}{int_to_mini_roman(tens)}"
```

The provided code defines a function int_to_mini_roman that takes a single argument n, representing the target integer to be converted into its mini roman numeral representation. This function leverages Python's built-in divmod() function to efficiently separate the input into two parts: the tens value and the remainder (rest).

It employs conditional statements to determine the specific roman numeral representation based on the value of `tens`. If `tens` is 1, it outputs the remainder as a single roman numeral (e.g., 'ix' for 9, 'iv' for 4, and 'i' for 1). If `tens` is greater than 1, it concatenates the roman numeral for the tens value with the result of recursively calling `int_to_mini_roman(rest)` to process the remainder. This allows for correct and efficient conversions. 

The code effectively handles the thousands constraint mentioned in the prompt by ensuring that the input stays within the range of 1000. In terms of style, it utilizes f-strings in Python for concise string formatting, enhancing the readability of the code.
