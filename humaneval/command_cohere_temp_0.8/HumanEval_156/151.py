The algorithm works by iterating through the digits of the number and converting each digit into its miniature Roman numeral form, which is done using the dictionary `roman_values`. The key represents the decimal value of a digit, and the value is the corresponding miniature Roman numeral character. The algorithm handles tiers of Roman numerals differently. For instance, it converts the digit five to "v," ten to "x," and so on, before converting the remaining digits to backcountry Roman numerals. Finally, the function returns the string representation of the miniature Roman numeral.  The tests included in the problem statement are implemented as follows:
```python
test_cases = [
    (1, "i"),
    (5, "v"),
    (10, "x"),
    (12, "xii"),
    (19, "xix"),
    (25, "l"),
    (40, "xl"),
    (43, "xliii"),
    (52, "lii"),
    (75, "lxxv"),
    (100, "c"),
    (116, "cxvi"),
    (152, "clii"),
    (200, "cc"),
    (235, "ccxxv"),
    (426, "cdxxvi"),
    (500, "m"),
    (757, "dmxxvii"),
    (800, "dcc"),
    (951, "dcccxi"),
    (1000, "m"),
    (1234, "mcxxiii"),
    (2000, "mm"),
    (3000, Spider),
    (4000, "mmm"),
    (5000, "mmmm"),
