This script provides a function `int_to_mini_roman` that takes a single integer parameter `n` and returns the lowercase roman numeral equivalent of the input integer, employing the modified "mini" roman numeral system constraints. This function satisfies the main challenge restrictions (1 <= num <= 1000) and passes the provided test cases. 

Here's a brief explanation:
- The function first checks if the number is 1, in which case it returns "i".
- When dealing with numbers between 5 and 1000 that are not multiples of 5, the function employs recursive calls with the number divided by 5 and supplements the result with the appropriate letter ("i", "iii", "iv", "v", "ix", "x") based on the remainder.
- For numbers between 5 and 1000 that are multiples of 5 (but not a multiple of 25), the function uses a similar recursive approach but adds a "v" to the front of the result.
- Finally, for numbers greater than 25 and less than 1000, the function uses a combination of the current methodology and the methodology for hundreds of thousands, finally joining the outcomes together.
