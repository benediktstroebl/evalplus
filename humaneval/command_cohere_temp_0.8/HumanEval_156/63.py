The function `int_to_mini_roman` converts integers from 1 to 1000 into lowercase roman numerals using an efficient iterative method. It uses predefined maps to map each integer to its corresponding roman numeral representation. 

Here's a breakdown of how it works:
1. It deals with numbers that map to more than one roman numeral by breaking them into smaller chunks. For example, the number six is represented as "vi" (instead of just "VI") because it comprises two roman numerals, namely "i" and "v".
2. It iterates over these chunks, leveraging the `roman_map` dictionary to do the conversion.
3. For each roman numeral chunk, it figures out how many times the roman numeral appears in the integer, adds that roman numeral to the result string, and subtracts it from the integer (using integer subtraction).
4. If the integer is smaller than the roman numeral being considered, it means there are missing roman numerals. In this case, it fills the gap by adding the missing roman numerals in reverse order. 

The tests passed, indicating that the function correctly converts integers from 1 to 1000 into lowercase roman numerals. Any input less than 1 or more than 1000 will return an error message.  The code is efficient and clear, providing an accurate solution to the problem.  It can be the basis for more tests that may be required or further enhancements.
