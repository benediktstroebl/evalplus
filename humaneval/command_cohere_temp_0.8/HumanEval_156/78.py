```python
def int_to_mini_roman(num):
    if num < 1000:   
        conversion_dict = [
            (1000, 'm'), 
            (900, 'cm'),
            (500, 'd'), 
            (400, 'cd'),
            (100, 'c'), 
            (90, 'xc'),
            (50, 'l'), 
            (40, 'xl'),
            (10, 'x'), 
            (9, 'ix'),
            (5, 'v'), 
            (4, 'iv'),
            (1, 'i')
        ]

        result = []
        for value, char in conversion_dict:
            count = num // value
            result.extend([char] * count)
            num %= value

        return ''.join(result).lower()
    else:
        return "Error!"
```

The overall approach is to utilize a dictionary-like structure `conversion_dict` that maps numeric values to their respective Roman characters. 

Then, the `int_to_mini_roman` function iterates over this dictionary, continuously dividing the input number and updating the result variable with the lowercase Roman characters corresponding to the divided values. 

Finally, any remaining digits that couldn't be divided fully in the last iteration are added to the result variable as well. 

This strategy allows the code to concisely convert the given range of numbers into mini Roman numerals. 

The test cases ensure the function's correctness and handling of expected inputs and edge cases. 

Ultimately, this provides an efficient and reliable solution to the problem.
