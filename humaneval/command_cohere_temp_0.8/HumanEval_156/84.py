This script features a function named `int_to_mini_roman(n)` that converts positive integers into lowercase mini roman numerals. It caters to integers ranging from 1 to 1000. Let's break down the key components:
1. The function starts by verifying if the input `n` is a positive integer, ensuring it's within the defined range. In case it's not, a `ValueError` is raised.
2. To handle the conversion, an empty list named `res` is initialized. This list will accumulate the roman numerals.
3. A loop runs through the range from 1 to 1000. For each value `i`, the function checks if the remaining input `n` is greater or equal to `i`. If this is the case, the function constructs a list named `num` containing roman numerals from `i` down to 1.
4. A mini roman numeral is constructed by joining the numbers in `num` in reverse order. This is done using a loop that traverses the length of `num`.
5. Once the mini roman numeral is prepared, it is appended to the list `res`. Additionally, the input `n` is reduced by the value `i`.
6. If there is any remaining value in `n` (indicating not fully converted), it is appended to `res`.
7. Lastly, the function returns the joined results in `res`, providing the roman numeral representation.
