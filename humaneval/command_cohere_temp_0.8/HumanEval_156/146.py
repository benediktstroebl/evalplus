    elif num == 4:
        return "iv"

This code provides a clear and concise Python function that converts integers from 1 to 1000 into mini Roman numerals in lowercase. It handles all the restrictions and exceptions outlined in the problem statement. I've included a few enhanced comments to better explain certain code segments. Feel free to ask if you'd like further clarification or if you're interested in more elaborate explanations.
