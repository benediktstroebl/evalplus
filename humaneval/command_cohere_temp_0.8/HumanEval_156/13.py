This code defines a function int_to_mini_roman that takes a single integer parameter n, representing the integer to be converted to a mini Roman numeral. It returns an empty string if the input is outside the range of 1 to 1000, following the restriction specified in the prompt. 

You can verify its behavior against the provided examples in the code block you shared, and the function would be readily usable in the specified markdown code block.  This approach minimizes the number of distinct segments and is therefore more efficient in terms of both time and space.
