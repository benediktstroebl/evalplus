The algorithm works by converting each integer digit into its roman numeral representation, then concatenating these representations together. The roman numeral system's rough ordering is meant to make this process simpler; numerals advance in value by multiples of 5s, 10s, 50s, 100s, 250s, 500s, and so on, with increments of 10 being the smallest. Thus, we can directly build up the roman numeral representation from the digits of the integer. 

This approach relies on string concatenation, which is not the most efficient method. A more optimized approach would use a single loop instead of two loops, but that would compromise the self-containment of the function as it would require the roman numeral values to be stored in pairs for efficient lookup. 

The tests this code would pass are those provided in the original prompt, which are:
```python
>>> int_to_mini_roman(19) == 'xix'
True
>>> int_to_mini_roman(152) == 'clii'
True
>>> int_to_mini_roman(426) == 'cdxxvi'
True
```

This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the input number and the space complexity of O(n) as well due to the res list. Though this is linear, a truly constant-space method would require a more complex approach with less self-contained functionality.
