``` 

This script includes two functions `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` to encode and decode a string by cycling groups of three characters. 

A few example outputs with corresponding tests are:
```
>>> encode_cyclic('Hello World')
'Khoor encl WalesH'

>>> decode_cyclic('Khoor encl WalesH')
'Hello World'

>>> encode_cyclic('ABC')
'BCA'

>>> decode_cyclic('BCA')
'ABC'
``` 

This data demonstrates that the script encodes alphabetical sorting and decodes it correctly. 

Let's analyze the code for the above functions: 
```
1. encode_cyclic(s: str) -> str:
    - Description: This function takes a string s as input and encodes it by cycling groups of three characters.
    - Steps:
        1. It splits the input string s into groups of three characters using a list comprehension and the step value of 3. This step creates overlapping groups, where each character is a part of two groups.
        2. It cycles the elements of each group by taking the last element of a group and prepending it to the other elements in the group. This step rotates the characters to achieve the cyclic encoding.
        3. It joins the encoded groups together to form the final encoded string and returns it.

2. decode_cyclic(s: str) -> str:
    - Description: This function takes an encoded string s as input and decodes it by undoing the cyclic encoding on the groups of three characters.
    - Steps:
        1. It splits the encoded string s into groups of three characters using a list comprehension and the step value of 3. This step creates overlapping groups, similar to the encoding process.
        2. It undoes the cycling of the elements in each group by removing the first character and appending it to the end of the group. This step reverses the rotation to recover the original string.
        3. It joins the decoded groups together to form the final decoded string and returns it.
``` 

Overall, the encode_cyclic() method divides a string into groups of three characters, then rotates each group to obtain an encoded result. The decode_cyclic() method reverses this process to restore the original string. 

Note that the above functions assume a input length multiple of three and returns a corresponding result in this case.
