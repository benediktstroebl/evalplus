The `encode_cyclic` function splits the input string into groups of three characters, then cycles the elements in each group to produce a new string. This process is repeated until the last group, which might have fewer than three characters, is handled correctly. 

The `decode_cyclic` function is designed to reverse the encoding process. It splits the input string into groups of three characters, then uncycles the elements in each group to reproduce the original string. Again, the last group, which might have fewer than three characters, is handled correctly. 

These functions are designed to work correctly even with strings that are not divisible by three or that have fewer than three characters. They pass the given test suite with flying colors.
