This code provides two functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, to accomplish the described problem. The `encode_cyclic` function takes a string and encodes it by splitting it into groups of three characters, then cycling these groups unless they have fewer than three elements. This results in an encoded string that is returned. The `decode_cyclic` function reconstructs the original string by decoding it from an encoded string generated by the `encode_cyclic` function. 

The code also includes automatic tests for both encode and decode cycles using the `test_encode()` and `test_decode()` functions to ensure that the solution is functioning correctly. 

Let me know if this resolves your question or if you would like me to explain any specific parts of the code in more detail.
