# Tests:

The `encode_cyclic` function splits the input string into groups of three characters (if the length isn't a multiple of three, it adds dummy characters at the beginning of each group). It then cycles these groups, inserting the last character of each group into the beginning of the next group. This process converts the input string to a confusing string. 

The `decode_cyclic` function reverses the process, converting characters encoded with `encode_cyclic` back to the original string. It iterates through the encoded string in groups of three, cycling the characters if needed, to recover the original string. 

The test cases demonstrate the functionality of the code, ensuring that the encoded strings are correctly decoded and vice versa. 

Overall, the provided code solves the problem posed and achieves the desired encoding and decoding functionality.
