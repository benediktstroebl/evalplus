The `encode_cyclic` function takes a string `s` as input and encodes it by splitting it into groups of three characters. If a group has fewer than three characters, it pads it with the first character to make it three characters long and then cycles the other two characters. It returns a string consisting of the cycled characters for each group. 

The `decode_cyclic` function decodes a string encoded with `encode_cyclic`. It splits the encoded string into a list of lists of characters. It then extracts characters from the list of lists, three at a time, to form the decoded string, in the order they were encoded.

The `test_encode` and `test_decode` functions test the `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions against a few simple inputs and assert that their outputs are correct.

Overall, the provided code solves the problem in a self-contained manner, with well-documented functions and corresponding tests.  It is important to ensure that the code works for any string size and doesn't impose any unnecessary restrictions on the input or output.
