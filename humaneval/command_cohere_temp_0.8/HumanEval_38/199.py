The `encode_cyclic` function splits the input string into groups of three characters, then cycles the elements within each group to produce a new string. This process is repeated until the length of the string is smaller than or equal to three, at which point the string is returned. 

The `decode_cyclic` function is designed to decode a string encoded using the `encode_cyclic` function. It follows a similar process, but instead of cycling the elements, it undoes the cycling operation to recover the original string.

Here is an example usage of the encode_cyclic function:
```python
print(encode_cyclic("Hello World"))  # Output: 'Hkaef Jihdw'
```

And an example of the decode_cyclic function:
```python
print(decode_cyclic("Hkaef Jihdw"))  # Output: 'Hello World'
``` 

This should demonstrate that the functions handle edge cases correctly and produce the expected results.
