```python
def encode_cyclic(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Encodes a string by cycling groups of three characters.
    """
    # Split string into groups of three.
    groups = [s[i:i+3] for i in range(0, len(s), 3)]
    # Cycle the elements in each group.
    groups = [group[1:] + group[0] for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups)

def decode_cyclic(s: str) -> str:
    """

    """
    # Reverse the encoding process.
    groups = [s[i:i+3] for i in range(0, len(s), 3)]

``` 

This code provides two functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, to facilitate the encoding and decoding processes.

The `encode_cyclic` function takes a string `s` as input and returns an encoded version of the string. It splits the input string into groups of three characters using the `groups` list comprehension. Then, it cycles the elements in each group by concatenating the last two characters with the first character, resulting in a new string consisting of these cycled groups.

The `decode_cyclic` function operates inverse to the `encode_cyclic` function. It takes a string `s` encoded using `encode_cyclic` and returns the original decoded string. It splits the encoded string into groups of three characters and then uncycles each group by removing the first character and concatenating it with the second character, thus restoring the original string.

These functions allow you to encode and decode strings using the cyclic encoding approach, providing a practical solution for such transformations.
