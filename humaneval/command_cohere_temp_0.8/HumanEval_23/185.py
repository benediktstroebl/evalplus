```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns the length of a string """
    return len(string)
```
This Python script provides a function termed `strlen` that takes a string argument and returns an integer representing the string's length. 

The function utilizes the `len()` function, which is a built-in Python function specifically designed to determine the length of a given sequence, including strings. 

To validate the correctness of this function, two test cases are conducted:
1. When an empty string is passed to the `strlen` function, it returns 0.
2. When the string 'abc' is passed, the function returns 3, which is the length of the string. 

These expected outputs demonstrate the function's ability to yield the lengths of the given strings.  This functionality is a core feature of Python strings, established to make programming efficient and concise.  In this case, the `strlen` function encapsulates this functionality to provide a straightforward solution to the problem.  This exercise serves as a fundamental demonstration of Python's capabilities and string manipulation.  The `strlen` function can be further customized to handle various edge cases and accommodate user-defined coding requirements.  Python's rich ecosystem and versatility provide many avenues for further exploration and application.  This includes advanced string methods, formatting, and interactions with external resources, among others.  As a dynamically typed language, Python also supports strong integration with various data types and their methods, enabling developers to select from a wide range of diverse solutions to solve a particular problem, including the one outlined here.  This makes it a flexible and expressive tool for various development needs.  As a result, Python is a widely adopted and popular programming language suited to a variety of use cases and developer preferences.
