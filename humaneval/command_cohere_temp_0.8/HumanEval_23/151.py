```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Return the number of characters in the provided string."""
    return len(s)
```

This straightforward function uses the built-in `len()` method to determine the number of characters in the input string `s`.  It efficiently executes the same task as the specification without added complexity. The function thoughtfully handles all scenarios, including empty strings, and provides the correct result.
