```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string """
    return len(string)
```
This Python function uses the built-in `len()` method to determine the number of characters in the provided string. It efficiently computes the length and returns an integer representing the string's length. 

This straightforward solution provides an easy way to determine the length of any given string.
