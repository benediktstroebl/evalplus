```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns the length of the given string """
    return len(string)
```

This Python script provides a function (`strlen`) that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of that string. The function leverages the `len()` function commonly used in Python to get the length of strings, thereby providing a quick and efficient way to determine the length of any given string. 

This solution is encapsulated and standalone, making it easily reusable in other scripts and compatible with diverse contexts. It can be utilized as a building block for more complex operations that require string length assessments. 

To use this code, copy and paste the function into your Python environment or script and employ the `strlen` function as needed, passing a string as an argument to acquire the corresponding string length.
