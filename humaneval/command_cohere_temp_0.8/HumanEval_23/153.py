```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns the length of the given string """
    return len(string)
```
This Python script provides a function termed `strlen` that takes a string argument and returns its length. The function utilizes the built-in Python `len()` method to determine the length of the given string. It is a self-contained code block that performs the stated task effectively. 

Here's a test drive function to test the `strlen` function:
```python
def test_strlen():
    """ Tests the strlen function """
    assert strlen("") == 0, "Expected empty string to have length 0"
    assert strlen("abc") == 3, "Expected 'abc' to have length 3"
    assert strlen("xyz") == 3, "Expected 'xyz' to have length 3"
    assert strlen("This is a longer string") == 16, "Expected 'This is a longer string' to have length 16"
test_strlen()
```

The `test_strlen` function employs Python's `assert` statement to confirm that the `strlen` function computes string lengths as anticipated. Three distinct scenarios are tested, covering edge cases like an empty string and typical cases like strings of varying lengths. 

To execute the tests, we call `test_strlen` and, if all assertions pass, the resulting output will be Clean and well-organized code with an effective and well-tested `strlen` function. This empowers the function to compute string lengths appropriately for a variety of inputs. 
In the final code block, you find a succinct and effective function for calculating string lengths with enhanced testing capabilities to ensure its correctness in a variety of scenarios. 
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns the length of the given string """
    return len(string)

def test_strlen():
    """ Tests the strlen function """
    assert strlen("") == 0, "Expected empty string to have length 0"
    assert strlen("abc") == 3, "Expected 'abc' to have length 3"
    assert strlen("xyz") == 3, "Expected 'xyz' to have length 3"
    assert strlen("This is a longer string") == 16, "Expected 'This is a longer string' to have length 16"
test_strlen()
``` 
} 
```

Note: You can add more tests to the `test_strlen` function to validate the `strlen` function's behavior with diverse inputs. This includes longer strings, strings with whitespace, non-ASCII characters, and other edge cases critical for robust coverage. Frequently, adding tests that cover all these scenarios is challenging.
