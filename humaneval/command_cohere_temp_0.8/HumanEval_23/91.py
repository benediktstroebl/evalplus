```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Returns the length of a string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script provides a function termed `strlen` taking a string-based parameter `s`, and returning its length as an integer. This function adheres to Python's type hinting format, specifying `s` as a string. 

To test the correctness of this function, it is recommended to utilize the Python interpreter incorporating a test suite through command lines like:
```python
>>> strlen("")
0
>>> strlen("abc")
3
>>> strlen("abc"+"X")
4
```

Updated changes regarding this function are as follows:
- Improved the function name from `return_string_length` to `strlen` for brevity and clarity.
- Introduced a docstring clarifying the function's purpose and behavior.
- Supplied test cases using the Python interpreter to validate the function's correctness.

These enhancements maintain code clarity, adopt best practices, and simplify tests for easy understanding. If you require further customization, feel free to modify the code!
