```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Return the length of the given string.
    """
    return len(string)
```
This Python function uses the built-in `len()` method to determine the number of characters in the given input string. It efficiently computes the length and returns an integer representing the string's length. This function is encapsulated in a self-contained code block, along with a helpful docstring that describes its purpose and behavior, making it accessible and understandable to users who may want to use or integrate it in their projects.
