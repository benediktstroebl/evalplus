```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Return the length of the given string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script defines a function called `strlen` that takes a string s as an argument and returns the length of that string. It utilizes the built-in Python function `len` to count the number of characters in the input string. 

This function is self-contained, meaning it does not rely on any external variables or functions other than those explicitly required to solve the problem. It is a straightforward solution to the given problem and is readily testable. You can verify its behavior by calling the function with different strings.
