```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Return the length of the given string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script provides a function (`strlen`) that takes a string (`s`) as input and returns the length of that string. This is achieved using the `len()` function, which is a built-in Python function that returns the number of items in a container, such as a string, list, or tuple. 

In this case, the function is designed to dynamically check if arguments are provided and if they are, returns the length of the string provided. The function includes a docstring that provides information about its purpose, inputs, and expected output. The function is designed to be self-explanatory and easy to understand through the use of this docstring.

To ensure the function is working accurately in different scenarios, let's test it using Python's built-in `unittest` module:
```python
import unittest

def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Return the length of the given string."""
    return len(s)

class TestStringLength(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_empty_string(self):
        self.assertEqual(strlen(""), 0)

    def test_non_empty_string(self):
        self.assertEqual(strlen("abc"), 3)

    def test_invalid_input(self):
        with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
            strlen(123)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this unittest, we create a test class `TestStringLength` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. This class contains three test methods: 

1. `test_empty_string`: In this method, we call `strlen()` with an empty string and assert that the result is 0, which is the expected length of an empty string.
2. `test_non_empty_string`: In this method, we call `strlen()` with the non-empty string "abc" and assert that the result is 3, which is the expected length of the string "abc".
3. `test_invalid_input`: This method aims to check how our function behaves when provided with invalid input (in this case, a number). In this method, we call `strlen()` with an integer argument and assert that it raises a `TypeError` error. 

Finally, `unittest.main()` is called to discover and run the tests. 

To run the test suite, you can save the Python script to a file (e.g., `test_strlen.py`) and execute the file using the Python interpreter:
```bash
python test_strlen.py
```

Once you run the file, Python's unittest will execute each test method, reporting whether the assertions pass or fail. 

This way, we ensure that the `strlen` function behaves as expected, providing correct results for different input scenarios and handling potential errors.  Besides, by using unittest, we can systematically test our function's behavior, ensuring its accuracy and reliability.  This is a critical practice in software development, especially when working on complex projects or dealing with data types other than strings.
