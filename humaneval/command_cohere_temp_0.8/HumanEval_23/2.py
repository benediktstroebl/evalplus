```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Return the length of the given string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script provides a function termed `strlen` taking a string-type argument labeled `s` and outputting an integer. This function accomplishes the goal of determining the length of a given string by employing the built-in `len` function.

For example, if one desires to determine the length of the string "abc", executing `strlen('abc')` yields the result `3`.

The function also includes a docstring, a valuable feature providing an explanation and clarification of its purpose, characteristics, and behavior. This particular docstring explains that the function's purpose is to calculate the length of a given string, and it includes exemplar evaluations to illustrate its utility. These exemplars demonstrate the function's behavior when provided with an empty string and the string "abc". The output of these demonstrations, respectively, is `0` and `3`.
