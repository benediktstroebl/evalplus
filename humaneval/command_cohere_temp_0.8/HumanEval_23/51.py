```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Return the length of the given string.
    """
    return len(string)
```
The provided Python script defines a function called `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of that string. It utilizes the built-in `len()` function to count the number of characters (including spaces, special characters, and punctuation) in the input string, regardless of the string's content or encoding. This function's straightforward functionality makes it ideal for calculating the length of any given string, as demonstrated by the included docstring, which also provides example usage.
