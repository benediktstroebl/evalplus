```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Returns the length of a string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script provides a function (`strlen`) that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of that string. This length is always an integer value.

The function incorporates the `len()` function, a built-in Python utility that calculates the number of characters (including spaces, punctuation, and any other typographical element) within a given string. 

Should you wish to check the function's behavior, you can call it with specific strings and examine the returned lengths:
```python
>>> strlen('')
0
>>> strlen('abc')
3
>>> strlen('This is a longer string')
16
```

Feel free to adapt this function to your specific needs, and let me know if you desire additional information or further examples.
