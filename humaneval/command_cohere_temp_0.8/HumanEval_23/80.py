```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string """
    return len(string)
```
This Python function uses the built-in `len` function to calculate the number of characters in the given string. It returns the length of the string passed to the function as an integer. 

Would you like to know more about the `len` function or have any other questions about this code? Feel free to ask, and I'll be glad to assist you!
