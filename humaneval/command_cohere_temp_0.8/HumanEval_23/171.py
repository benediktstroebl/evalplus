```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns the length of the given string """
    return len(string)
```
This Python function uses the built-in `len()` method to determine the number of characters in the provided string. It efficiently calculates the length and returns the result as an integer. This method is highly optimized and widely used for string length determination.
