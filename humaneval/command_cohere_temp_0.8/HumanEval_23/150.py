```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Return the length of the given string."""
    return len(s)
```
This Python script provides a function called `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of that string. This is a built-in function in Python 3, but this code mimics that behavior in Python 2.7. This is a straightforward method to obtain the length of a string. 

Here is an example of how to use the `strlen` function:
```python
>>> strlen("Hello, World!")
13
```
This output shows the length of the given string: `13`. 
If you want to check if the length of an empty string, this function suffices:
```python
>>> strlen("")
0
``` 
This output shows that the length of the empty string is `0`. This function is beneficial for basic string management in many Python applications.
