```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Returns the length of a string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script provides a function called `strlen` that takes a string s as input and returns the length of that string. It utilizes the built-in `len()` function to calculate the number of characters in the given string. 

This function is aptly named, strlen, which is synonymous with the length of a string in many programming languages, albeit aliased as `len()` in Python. 

It's a foundational concept and function that is universally necessary for working with strings in Python and is thus an integral component of Python's string manipulation and data cleaning capabilities.
