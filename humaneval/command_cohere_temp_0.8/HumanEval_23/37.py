```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Return the length of the given string."""
    return len(s)
```
This Python script provides a function termed `strlen` that takes a string object as an argument and returns an integer denoting the length of the string. The function utilizes the `len()` function, a built-in Python function that calculates the number of characters in a given string, to compute the length and return the resulting integer. 

This simple utility can prove to be useful anytime you require finding the length of a string in your Python programs. It provides a straightforward and effective solution without adding any additional complexity to the script. 

You can incorporate this function into your projects to test its capabilities and efficiency. Additionally, you can use the `len()` function directly if only needing to compute the length of a string momentarily in your code. The function is designed to be readily accessible and adaptable to diverse string-related difficulties.
