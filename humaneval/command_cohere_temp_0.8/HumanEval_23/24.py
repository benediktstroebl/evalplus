```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns the length of a string. """
    return len(string)
```

This Python script provides a function (`strlen`) that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of that string. The function leverages the `len()` function, which is a built-in Python utility to compute the length of given strings, providing the desired result. 

This function is encapsulated with a docstring providing descriptive information about its purpose, input, and output. This documentation string is useful for understanding the function's intended use and behavior, making it easier for developers to quickly comprehend its functionality and accordingly, effectively integrate it within their programs. 

You can import this function into your code to easily calculate the string length without repeatedly writing the logic to do so.
