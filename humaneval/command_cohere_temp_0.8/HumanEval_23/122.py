```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Return the length of a string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script defines a function called `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of that string. The `len()` function is a built-in Python function that returns the number of items in a container, such as a string, list, or tuple. 

In this case, the `strlen` function is evaluated by checking if it returns the length of the given string "abc" which is 3. The function is correctly defined to return the length of any string passed to it, as the len() function is applied to the string input parameter. Thus, this implementation of `strlen` satisfies the test cases in the original prompt. 

This fundamental function is useful for many different tasks, such as determining the size of a string for writing to a file or sending data to a network connection.
