```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Return the length of the given string.
    """
    return len(string)
```

This Python script provides a function termed `strlen` taking a string object as an argument and returning its length as an integer. The function utilizes the built-in `len` function of Python to calculate the number of characters in the given string. It is a self-contained script as it performs the task solely using built-in Python functionalities, and it also includes a test scenario to validate its functionality.

The function serves a fundamental role in many applications involving string manipulation and is a utility component in various program contexts.
