```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns the length of the given string """
    return len(string)
```

This Python script provides a function `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns its length. The function utilizes the built-in Python function `len` to calculate the number of characters in the given string. It is a self-contained code block that defines the function, and the function accomplishes the task stated in the markdown code block. 

Here are some test cases to confirm its behavior:
```python
# Test Case 1
>>> strlen("Hello, World!")
13

# Test Case 2
>>> strlen("")
0

# Test Case 3
>>> strlen("ABC")
3
```

This shows that the `strlen` function correctly calculates and returns the length of the given string. If you want more information on the `len` function or string manipulation in Python, please ask!
