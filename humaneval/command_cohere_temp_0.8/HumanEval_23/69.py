```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns the length of the given string """
    return len(string)
```
This Python script provides a function (`strlen`) that takes a string as an argument and returns its length. The function utilizes the `len()` function, which returns the number of items in a container (such as a string, list, or dictionary) to solve the problem. It returns the length of the given string, as expected. 
The function includes a docstring that provides a brief description of its purpose and behavior, instantly informing readers of its function.
