```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns the length of the given string """
    return len(string)
```

This Python script provides a function termed `strlen` taking a string argument and returning its length. The function utilizes the built-in Python `len()` method to determine the length of the given string. It is a self-contained code block demonstrating the `strlen` function with no dependencies, making it compatible with any Python version. 

The function is crafted with a docstring providing a description of the task it accomplishes, and it also includes example tests showcasing its utility through the evaluation of empty and non-empty strings, further illustrating its suitability for the intended purpose. 

```python
>>> strlen('')
0
>>> strlen('abc')
3
```

The example tests emphasize the function's ability to solve the problem by returning the length of the provided string, confirming its usefulness in real-world scenarios.
