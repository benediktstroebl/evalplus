```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Returns the length of a string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script provides a function (`strlen`) that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of that string. This length is always an integer value. 

To confirm, here are some test cases and their expected outputs:
```python
>>> strlen("Hello")
5
>>> strlen("World")
5
>>> strlen("!!"")
3
>>> strlen("")
0
```

Feel free to add more test cases if needed to cover more scenarios. Let me know if you need help with anything!
