```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Return the number of characters in the string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script defines a function called `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns the number of characters (including spaces, punctuation, and any other characters) in the string. 

The function utilizes the `len()` method to determine the length of the given string. 

The `len()` method returns the number of bytes in the string when used with string data, which corresponds to the number of characters in the string assuming each character corresponds to a single byte. 

This approach is not specific to markdown pages. You can utilize this function in your Python code as well. 

This function is straightforward and effective, providing a reliable way to determine the length of a string in a variety of applications.
