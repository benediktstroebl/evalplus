```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Return the length of the given string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script defines a function called `strlen` that takes a string input `s` and returns the length of that string. It utilizes the `len()` function, which is a built-in Python function used to determine the number of characters (including spaces and special characters) in a given string. 

This function provides a clear and efficient way to find the length of a string in Python.

The function is defined with a docstring that describes its purpose, and the `>>> ` block is used for evaluating the function with example inputs and printing the corresponding outputs. 

These additions provide information about the function's usage and behavior, enhancing the readability and understandability of the code.
