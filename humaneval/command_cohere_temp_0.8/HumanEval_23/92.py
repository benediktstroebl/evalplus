```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns the length of a string. """
    return len(string)
```

This Python script provides a function (`strlen`) that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of that string. The function leverages the `len()` function, a built-in Python utility, to calculate the number of characters (including spaces, special characters, and punctuation) in the input string. This len() function is a crucial tool for measuring the size of various data structures, like lists, dictionaries, and even raw bytes. 

The function works seamlessly for various input scenarios, including empty strings, commonplace words, and even sentences with special characters and numbers. This versatility is exemplified in the function's specification, detailed in the docstring, which presents sample tests and their corresponding outcomes. Specifically, the docstring outlines that an empty string succinctly returns 0 and that the `'abc'` string returns a character count of 3. 

While the function is remarkably straightforward in its reliance on the `len()` method, it forms a pivotal component in solving more complex problems that involve manipulating strings or assessing their contents. The function is appropriately tested and will yield the desired results when implemented correctly. 

It is paramount to recognize that the `strlen()` function serves a very specific purpose in returning the string length and is thus honed to excel at this task. While the function can prove invaluable in real-world applications, it is essential to understand that the problem it solves is inherently simple, given the abundant capabilities of modern Python.
