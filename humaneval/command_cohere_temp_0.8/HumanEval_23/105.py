```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Return the length of the given string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script provides a function called `strlen` that takes a string input `s` and returns the length of that string. The function utilizes the `len()` function, which is a built-in Python function used to calculate the length of strings, lists, and other iterable objects. 

To validate the correctness of this function, two test cases are included. These test cases utilize Python's `unittest` module, which is a built-in testing framework, to evaluate the function's behavior against expected outputs. 

The first test case checks if the function outputs 0 when an empty string is passed in. The second test case checks if the function outputs the correct length of a sample string. 

To run these test cases, you can use the following command:
```python
python unittest unittest_strlen.py
```

After executing this command, Python's unittest will run the provided test cases and output a summary of the tests, indicating whether the function's implementations pass or fail. 

This command is built-in Python syntax designed to execute test files and provide comprehensive feedback on the functionality and efficacy of code.
