```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns the length of a string """
    return len(string)
```
This Python script provides a function `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns its length. The function utilizes the built-in Python `len()` method to calculate the number of characters in the given string, including spaces, punctuation, and any other characters the string contains. It is a concise and efficient way to find the length of a string in Python.
