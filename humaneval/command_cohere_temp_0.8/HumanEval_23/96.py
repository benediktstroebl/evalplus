```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Returns the length of a string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script defines a function called `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of that string. This is achieved by using the `len()` function in Python, which returns the number of items (in this case, characters) in a given iterable (in this case, a string), sending the total number of characters as the output. 

The function is annotated with a docstring, which is a multi-line comment enclosed in triple quotes. These docstrings provide information about the function, describing its purpose, inputs, and expected behavior. They are useful for developers to understand the functionality of the function and its usage.
