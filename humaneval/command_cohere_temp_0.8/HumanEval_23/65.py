```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Returns the length of a string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script defines a function called `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of that string. This is achieved by using the built-in Python function `len`, which takes a string as an argument and returns the number of characters in it. 

The function is tested with the following test cases:
- **`strlen('')`**: This test case returns 0, since an empty string has no characters.
- **`strlen('abc')`**: This test case returns 3, since the string 'abc' has 3 characters.

These tests ensure that the `strlen` function behaves as expected and correctly calculates the length of any given string. 

This approach guarantees the offering of a straightforward and easy-to-use function that fulfills the initial problem statement.
