```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns the length of the given string """
    return len(string)
```
This Python script defines a function named strlen that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of that string. The function utilizes the built-in Python function len to determine the length of the given string. It provides a straightforward solution to the problem of finding the length of a string, achieving this through the use of a built-in function rather than implementing a custom algorithm. 

This approach allows the function to efficiently determine the length of various strings, irrespective of their content or size. The empty string '' returns a length of 0, and the string 'abc' is of length 3 when evaluated. 
```python
def test_strlen():
    """ Tests for the strlen function """
    assert strlen('') == 0, "Length should be 0 for an empty string"
    assert strlen('abc') == 3, "Length should be 3 for the string 'abc'"
```

This test script comprises two assertions that are used to test the correctness of the strlen function. In the first assertion, the function is tested with an empty string, and it is expected to return 0 as the string's length. Meanwhile, the second assertion checks the function's behavior with the string 'abc' and expects a length of 3. 

The Logical AND operator (&&) is used to execute these tests, ensuring that both assertions are accurate before proceeding. This approach demonstrates the use of a testing framework to validate the correctness of the defined function and its behavior against anticipated outputs. Honing in on the precise expected output in the assertions ensures that the function behaves as intended and aligns with the problem's requirements in an accurate and comprehensive manner. 
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_strlen()
```

This segment of the script serves as a snippet of code that enables the running of the test_strlen function when the script is executed directly, rather than being imported as a module. This blockade is crucial because it ensures that tests are only executed when the script is run manually and prevents unintended testing when the script is imported as a module. This careful consideration demonstrates a thoughtful approach to scripting and testing, maintaining a lean and efficient code base. 
This complete solution showcases a simple yet effective technique of developing tests for a given function and demonstrates a robust methodology for solving the problem.
