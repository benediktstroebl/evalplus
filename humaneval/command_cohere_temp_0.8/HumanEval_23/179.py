```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Return the length of a string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script defines a function called `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of that string. This is achieved by using the built-in `len` function applied to the string input. 

Would you like to know more about this function or anything else related to Python string manipulation? Feel free to ask, and I'll be glad to help!
