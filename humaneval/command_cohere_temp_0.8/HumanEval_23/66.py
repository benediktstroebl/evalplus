```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns the length of a string """
    return len(string)
```
This Python function uses the built-in `len()` method to return the number of characters in the input string. It efficiently calculates the length of any string input and does not require any additional external variables or functions to fulfill the problem requirement.
