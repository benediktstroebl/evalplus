```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Returns the length of a string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script provides a function called `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of that string. This is achieved using the `len()` function, which is a built-in Python function that returns the number of items in a container, such as a string, list, or tuple. 

For example, if we want to retrieve the length of the string "Hello, World!", we can call the `strlen` function like this: 
```python
 strlen("Hello, World!")
```

Executing this code will print the output `13`, since it is the length of the string "Hello, World!". 

This approach leverages the built-in `len()` function, which provides a efficient and concise way to find the length of a string in Python.
