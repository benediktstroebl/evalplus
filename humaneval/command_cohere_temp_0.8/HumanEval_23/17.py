```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns the length of a string """
    return len(string)
```
This Python script provides a function called `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of that string. The function uses the `len()` function, which is a built-in Python function that returns the number of items in a variable. 

To pass the corresponding tests, it returns the correct length for empty and non-empty strings. 

This is a reationalized response with corrections to adhere to the specified problem statement and test cases, while also enhancing the clarity of the function documentation through the use of docstrings.
