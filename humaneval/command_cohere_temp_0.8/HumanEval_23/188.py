```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Returns the length of a string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script provides a function called `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns the string's length as an integer. It utilizes the built-in `len` function to calculate the number of characters in the given string, providing a concise and efficient solution.

If given an empty string, it will return `0`, and if provided with the string `'abc'`, it will return `3`.

This fundamental function is a building block for various Python operations involving strings and their properties.
