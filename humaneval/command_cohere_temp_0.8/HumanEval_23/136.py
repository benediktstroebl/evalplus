```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Return the length of the given string.
    """
    return len(string)
```
The Python script defines a function called `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of that string. This function utilizes the built-in Python `len()` function to determine the number of characters in the given string. It is a straightforward mechanism for finding out the length of a string and is particularly useful for quick computations within Python programs. 
The function is designed with a docstring, which is a multi-line comment enclosed in triple quotes. These strings provide a more detailed description of the function's purpose, inputs, and expected behavior. In this case, the docstring explains that the `strlen` function calculates the length of a given string, which is helpful for users who may want to understand or utilize the function in their code. 

This function is self-contained, meaning it does not rely on any external variables or contexts; it can be used immediately upon definition due to its straightforward nature. Additionally, the function's behavior is demonstrated through the use of example tests in the docstring using the `>>> ` prefix. These tests check the function's behavior with empty and non-empty strings, showcasing its ability to correctly calculate string lengths. 

Overall, this Python script presents a simple and effective solution to the problem of determining the length of a string, making it accessible and easily integratable within various Python applications and programs that deal with string manipulation and processing.
