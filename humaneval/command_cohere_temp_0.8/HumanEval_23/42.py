```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Returns the length of a string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script provides a function called `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns the string's length. The function utilizes the `len()` function, which returns the number of items in a container object like a string, to solve this problem. It's a built-in function in Python specifically designed to get the length of an object. 

In this case, the strlen function simplifies the process by directly returning the length of the provided string. You can use it by simply calling the function with a string as an argument, like this:
```python
strlen("Python")  # Output: 7
```

This will print 7, which is the length of the string "Python". 

Overall, the `strlen` function offers an intuitive way to determine the length of a string in Python.  If you need to verify or extract the length of several strings, this function can be particularly helpful.
