```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Returns the length of a string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script provides a function called `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns the string's length as an integer. The function utilizes the built-in Python `len()` method to determine the length of the given string. It is a straightforward and efficient approach to finding the length of a string and is commonly used in many Python applications.
