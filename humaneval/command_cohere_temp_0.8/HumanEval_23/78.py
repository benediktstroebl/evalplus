```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Returns the length of a string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script provides a function called `strlen` that takes a string input (`s: str`) and returns the length of that string. It utilizes the built-in `len()` function to compute the number of characters in the given string. 

The function is designed to adhere to the Python style guideline for function formatting, including explicit type declaration for the input parameter and the return value. This code maintains PEP 8 standards and includes a docstring to describe the function's purpose and behavior, making it accessible for online documentation generation tools.
