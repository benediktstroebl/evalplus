```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns the length of a string. """
    return len(string)
```

This Python function uses the `len()` method to determine the number of characters in the input string. It efficiently calculates the length and returns the result as an integer. 

The function is self-contained and does not rely on any external variables or assumptions. It accepts a string as input and provides the string's length as output, making it an effective and reusable solution for calculating string lengths. 

If you'd like, I can also provide an example of how to utilize this function in a test-driven development (TDD) context, wherein the function is used and subsequently tested to ensure its correctness based on the given requirement.
