```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Return the length of the given string.
    """
    return len(string)
```

This Python function uses the `len()` method to determine the number of characters in the input string. 

Would you like to know more about unit testing in Python, or how to improve this function further? Let me know, and feel free to ask any questions!
