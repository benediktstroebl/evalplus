```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Return the length of the given string.
    """
    return len(string)
```
The provided Python code defines a function called `strlen` that takes a string argument and returns the length of that string. It utilizes the built-in `len()` function to determine the number of characters (including spaces, special characters, and punctuation) in the given string, which is then returned as the result. 

This function provides a convenient way to determine the length of any given string by simply calling `strlen(string)` and passing the string as an argument, regardless of its content or size.

If you have a string `'abc'` you can use this function to get its length as follows: 
```python
length = strlen('abc')
print(length)
```
This will output `3` to the console, indicating that the length of the string `'abc'` is indeed 3 characters long.
