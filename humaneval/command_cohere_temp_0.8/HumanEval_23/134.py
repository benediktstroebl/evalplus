```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string """
    return len(string)
```
This function uses the built-in Python `len()` method to return the length of the given string. It takes a string as an argument and returns the number of characters (including spaces and special characters) in the string. 
The function is self-contained and does not rely on any external libraries or modules. It is a simple and efficient way to obtain the length of a string.
