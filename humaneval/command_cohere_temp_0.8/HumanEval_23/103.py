```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Returns the length of a string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script defines a function called `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of that string. This is achieved by using the `len()` function in Python, which takes a string as an argument and returns the number of characters (including spaces, punctuation, and any other characters) in the string. 

The function is self-contained, meaning it does not rely on any external libraries or functions, other than the standard Python library, and it can be run independently in a Python environment. 

The function also includes a docstring, which is a multi-line comment that provides a more comprehensive description of the function, including the purpose of the function, the types of arguments it takes, and the value it returns. Docstrings are useful for developers who will be using or editing this function in the future, allowing them to understand its function and its expected usage. 

This code passes the given tests, such as when the function is called with an empty string, it returns 0, and when it's called with the string 'abc', it returns 3.
