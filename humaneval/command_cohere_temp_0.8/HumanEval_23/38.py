```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns the length of the given string """
    return len(string)
```
This Python script defines a function called `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of that string. The function uses the `len()` function, which is a built-in Python function, to determine the number of characters (including spaces, special characters, and punctuation) in the given string. 

The function is called with two different strings, '', and 'abc', to demonstrate its functionality. The test outputs are:
```
0
3
```
The first test case, '' (empty string), returns 0 since it contains no characters. The second test case, 'abc', returns 3 because it contains three characters: 'a', 'b', and 'c'. 

This basic code can be used as a building block for more complex operations that require determining the length of a string.
