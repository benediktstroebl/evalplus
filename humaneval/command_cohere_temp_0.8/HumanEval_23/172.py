```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Return the length of a string."""
    return len(s)
```
This Python script provides a function called `strlen` that takes a string s as an argument and returns the length of that string. The function utilizes the built-in Python function `len` to calculate the number of characters in the given string. It then returns the length as an integer. 

This function is self-contained, meaning it does not rely on any external libraries or variables. Therefore, it can be freely copied and used in any Python environment where it will behave as described.  It is also encapsulated, as it has no implicit return value, parameter, or side effects, meeting the criteria of the Single Responsibility Principle from SOLID principles.

Should you have further requirements or additional details surrounding the problem, please do not hesitate to ask.
