```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Return the length of the given string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script defines a function called `strlen` that takes a string input `s` and returns the length of that string. It utilizes the `len()` function, which is a built-in Python function that accepts a string and returns its length, to achieve this. 

This function provides a clear and efficient way to determine the length of a string, making it useful for various applications in string manipulation and analysis.

The blank line and the single-line comment ("Return the length...") are styling additions meant to enhance the readability of the code block. They aren't necessary for the code to function properly, but they help organize the code and provide explanatory context. 

The triple quotes (""") around the function docstring allow the text to span multiple lines and make it easier to read and understand the documentation inline in the Markdown code block.
