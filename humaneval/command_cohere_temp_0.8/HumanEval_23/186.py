```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Return the length of a string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script provides a function called `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of that string. This is achieved by utilizing the built-in `len()` function in Python, which computes the number of characters in a given string. The `strlen` function is designed to accept a string of any length and efficiently calculate its length, regardless of the string's content. This straightforward solution offers a quick and reliable way to determine the length of any string.
