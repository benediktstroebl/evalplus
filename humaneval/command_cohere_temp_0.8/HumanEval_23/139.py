```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Return the number of characters in the string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script defines a function called `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns the number of characters (including spaces, punctuation, and any other symbols) in that string. The function uses the `len()` function to calculate the length of the string and returns it as an integer. 

The specification comment before the function defines the function's purpose and showcases example usage that confirms the function's behavior. 

To handle empty strings, the function follows Python's indexing behavior, which returns 0 for an empty input. This alignment with Python's inherent behavior ensures that the function is intuitive and conforms to the expectations of Python developers.  This function is straightforward and a go-to solution for determining the length of a string in Python, aiding in various applications that require string manipulation and analysis.
