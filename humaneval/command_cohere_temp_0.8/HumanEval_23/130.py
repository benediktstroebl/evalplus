```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns the length of the given string """
    return len(string)
```
This Python function uses the built-in `len()` method to return the number of characters in the provided string. 
The function is self-contained and does not rely on any external variables or functions. 
It's also worth noting that the `->` symbol is typically used in Python to denote return types in function annotations, rather than the double arrow `=>` commonly used in Markdown. 
If you intend to include syntax highlighting and scripting language directives in your script, please let me know the desired markup language, such as Markdown, HTML, or LaTeX. I'll gladly render the appropriate code block for you.
