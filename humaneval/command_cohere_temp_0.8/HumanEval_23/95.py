```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Return the length of the given string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script provides a function called `strlen` that takes a string input `s` and returns the length of that string. It utilizes the built-in `len` function to compute the number of characters in the input string. 

The function is designed to address the problem of determining the length of a given string, as exemplified in the provided test cases:
```python
>>> strlen('')
0
>>> strlen('abc')
3
```

This Python solution is concise and efficient, leveraging a built-in function to reliably compute string lengths. It serves as a straightforward approach for string length computation within various application scenarios. If you want to improve this solution, you can write your own length calculation function to better suit specific needs or constraints.

This code snippet can be imported and utilized in other Python scripts that need to determine the length of a string. It can also be modified to handle different string types or consider additional factors when calculating string length, based on the requirements of the specific application or problem at hand.
