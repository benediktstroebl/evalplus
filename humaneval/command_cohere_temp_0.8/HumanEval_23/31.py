```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Returns the length of a string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script provides a function called `strlen` that takes a string s as input and returns the length of that string. The function utilizes the built-in Python function `len` to calculate the number of characters in the given string. It is a straightforward and efficient approach to obtaining the string length. 

The function is enclosed in a test block, where it is tested against two test cases: an empty string and a non-empty string. The function is designed to return 0 when the empty string is provided as input, in accordance with Python's convention for string length, and it correctly returns 3 for the non-empty string 'abc'. These test cases validate the correctness of the `strlen` function, ensuring that it performs as expected and adheres to its specification. 

This code segment showcases Python's elegant and efficient craftsmanship, where the `len` function neatly handles the string length computation without the need for a bespoke algorithm. The function is appropriately documented with a docstring that summarizes its purpose and behavior, enhancing code comprehension and aiding in future maintainability. 

By employing this code, you can effortlessly embed the `strlen` function within your Python projects and harness its capability to confidently compute string lengths as needed.
