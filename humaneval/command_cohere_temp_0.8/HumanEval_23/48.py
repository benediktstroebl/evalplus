```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Return the length of a string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script provides a function called `strlen` that takes a string s as input and returns the length of that string. The function utilizes the built-in `len` function to calculate the number of characters in the given string. To validate the correctness of the `strlen` function, two test cases are conducted, and the expected output is displayed as well.

In the first test case, the function is tested with an empty string, and as expected, it returns 0 as the string length since an empty string has no characters. In the second test case, the function is tested with the non-empty string "abc", and it returns 3 as the string length since "abc" contains 3 characters (a, b, and c). The expected output demonstrates the proper functionality of the `strlen` function in calculating the length of the given strings, providing a reliable and straightforward way to retrieve string lengths in Python. 

This approach allows for an easy determination of the length of various strings and facilitates the development of more complex string-handling operations in applications.
