```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Return the length of the given string.
    """
    return len(string)
```
The Python script defines a function `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of the string, utilizing the `len` function that returns the number of items in a container (e.g., length of the string in this case), as an integer. 

The function is then tested with empty and non-empty strings, and the expected output of 0 and 3 is confirmed. 

This function is self-contained and does not depend on any external libraries or modules, making it suitable to be used and ported across various environments that have Python support.
