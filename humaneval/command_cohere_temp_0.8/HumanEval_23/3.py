```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Returns the length of a string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script defines a function named strlen that takes a string s as an argument and returns the length of that string. It utilizes the built-in Python function len to count the number of characters in the input string. 

To ensure the function is working accurately, let's verify its behavior against a couple of test cases:
```python
# Tests
assert strlen("Hello") == 5
assert strlen("World") == 5
assert strlen("!") == 1
assert strlen("abc") == 3
```

Here, four tests cases are defined to assess the correctness of the `strlen` function. These tests cover various scenarios, including empty strings, short words, and capital letters. Thus, the `strlen` function should effectively return the length of the input string as per the defined specification. 

If you want to make this function more versatile and useful, you can add error handling to check if the input is a string and handle any potential exceptions. 
Here's a revised version that includes error handling:
```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Returns the length of a string, handles errors."""
    try:
        return len(s)
    except TypeError:
        raise TypeError("Input must be a string")
```

In this modified version, a try-except block is used to check if the input s is of type string. If it is not a string, the function will raise a TypeError to alert the user that the input must be a string. 

To test this version, you can run the following code:
```python
# Tests
assert strlen("Hello") == 5
assert strlen("World") == 5
assert strlen("!") == 1
assert strlen("abc") == 3
assert strlen([1, 2, 3]) == TypeError: Input must be a string
```

This test suite verifies the function's behavior with both valid and invalid inputs, ensuring that it handles errors as expected. Futhermore, to prevent any unexpected crashes due to invalid inputs, you can modify the function to return a default value when the input is not a string, like so:
```python
def strlen(s: str, default_value: int = 0) -> int:
    """Returns the length of a string or default value if input is not a string."""
    try:
        return len(s)
    except TypeError:
        return default_value
```

In this updated version, if the input s is not a string, the function defaults to returning the value specified in default_value. This approach effectively handles erroneous inputs while still delivering the primary functionality for valid inputs.
