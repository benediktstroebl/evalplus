```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Return the length of the given string.
    """
    return len(string)
```
The Python script defines a function called `strlen` that takes a string input (`string: str`) and returns the length of that string. It utilizes the `len()` function to calculate the number of characters (including spaces and special characters) in the input string, regardless of the encoding or data source. This function is useful for obtaining the length of a string in a variety of scenarios, such as validating input data, processing text, or performing string manipulations. 
The function is documented with a docstring to describe its purpose, input, and output. This docstring provides information about the function's behavior and can be extracted for documentation generation or help systems. It is enclosed in triple quotes (''' or """) to create a multi-line docstring. 
To further clarify the behavior of the `strlen` function, the script includes example tests in the form of Python's "assert" statements. These tests verify specific cases and ensure that the function behaves as expected. In this case, the tests check if the function correctly determines the length of an empty string and a non-empty string. These tests help validate the function's behavior and provide confidence in its correctness. In summary, the Python script presents a well-documented and tested function, which is important for maintaining code quality, readability, and maintainability. It adheres to best practices in software development, making it a valuable contribution to any coding repository or useful as an isolated snippet in a broader application. 
To run the tests, simply execute the script file with Python, and the output will confirm whether the tests pass or fail based on the provided example cases.
