```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns the length of the given string """
    return len(string)
```

This Python script provides a function (`strlen`) that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of that string. The function leverages the `len()` function, which is a built-in Python function that returns the number of items in a given object, to calculate the length of the input string. 

To validate the correctness of this function, two test cases are defined below:
```python
>>> strlen('')
0
>>> strlen('abc')
3
```

The first test case passes an empty string, and the function is expected to return 0. The second test case passes the string 'abc', and the function is expected to return 3. 

These tests can be run by executing the script and confirming that the output is consistent with the expected values. 
```python
python script.py
```

These tests are foundational; for more comprehensive testing, you can incorporate additional test cases to cover a wide range of scenarios, including strings of different lengths and characters. 

The function docstring provides clarity for users who may want to understand the function's purpose and usage. This documentation is crucial, especially when multiple functions are involved or when the function is part of a larger project. It simplifies the process of understanding the purpose and usage of specific functions, making the codebase more maintainable and accessible.
