```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Return the length of the given string.
    """
    return len(string)
```
The Python script defines a function called `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of that string. This is achieved using the `len()` function that is built into Python, which computes the number of characters (including spaces and special characters) in a string.  This function provides an easy and reliable way to determine the size of any given string in terms of the number of characters it contains.
