```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Returns the length of a string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script defines a function called `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of that string. This is achieved by using the built-in `len` function applied to the given string `s`. 

The function is annotated with a docstring that describes its purpose, and the script includes examples of how to use the function to verify its behavior. The docstring and example usage demonstrate best practices in software development, providing clarity and guidance for users of this code in the future.
