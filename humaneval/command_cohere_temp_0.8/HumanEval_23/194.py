```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string """
    return len(string)
```
This Python script provides a function called `strlen` that takes a string input and returns its length. It utilizes the `len()` function to calculate the number of characters in the given string. To use this function, simply call it by passing a string as an argument, and it will return the length of that string.
