```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Return the length of the given string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script defines a function called `strlen` that takes a string input `s` and returns the length of that string. It utilizes the built-in `len` function to calculate the number of characters in the input string. 

This function is encapsulated in a test suite, consisting of two test cases that ensure its correctness against specific test inputs. The first test case checks if the function returns 0 when the empty string is provided. The second test case verifies the function's behavior when a non-empty string is passed, confirming that the result is the number of characters in the non-empty string. 

This kind of test suite is essential in validating the expected behavior of the `strlen` function and ensures its effectiveness in diverse scenarios. umi√®res
