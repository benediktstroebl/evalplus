```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Returns the length of a string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script provides a function (`strlen`) that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of that string. The function leverages the `len()` function, which is a built-in Python utility to compute the length of given strings, providing the desired result. 

This solution is encapsulated and independent, making it both efficient and accessible without relying on external utilities. 

Feel free to adapt and incorporate this solution in your code for string length computation. 
If you would like me to explain any part of the code further or provide additional insights, please don't hesitate to ask.
