```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Returns the length of a string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script provides a function called `strlen` that takes a string input `s` and returns the length of that string. It utilizes the built-in `len()` function to calculate the number of characters in the input string. 

This function is encapsulated in a way that is easy to understand and utilizes an informative docstring, which includes a summary of its functionality, as well as specific examples to demonstrate how it behaves for different inputs.

If you want to test this function, you can incorporate it into a separate script or integrate it into a bigger program; alternatively, you can test it directly from the Python interpreter by keying in the following command and observing the output:
```python
strlen(' abc ')
```

This will output the result: `3` ?which confirms that the function effectively determines the length of the given string, factoring in spaces and special characters.
