```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns the length of the given string """
    return len(string)
```
This Python script provides a function called `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of the string. It utilizes the built-in `len()` function to count the number of characters (including spaces and special characters) in the input string, regardless of its content. 
The function is designed to adhere to the Python style guidelines and document strings for clear understanding. 
It is a self-contained code block that can be executed independently to provide the specified functionality. 
If you want to test this script, you can call the `strlen` function with different strings and verify that it returns the expected lengths.
