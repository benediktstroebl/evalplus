```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Return the length of a string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script provides a function called `strlen` that takes a string input `s` and returns the length of that string. The function utilizes the `len()` function, which is a built-in Python function that returns the number of items in a container, to compute the length of the input string `s`. It is important to note that this function does not have an explicit return statement since Python automatically returns the last expression evaluated in a function.

The function's behavior is illustrated through examples in the function's docstring, which is a string that contains useful information about the function's parameters, return value, and behavior. The docstring employs the `>>> ` syntax to indicate the execution of the `strlen` function against specific inputs and the subsequent output, providing a functional illustration of the function's behavior.

In this case, the docstring demonstrates that when the `strlen` function is applied to an empty string (`''`), it yields `0`, while applying it to the string `'abc'` results in a return value of `3`. This aligns with the function's expected behavior of returning the string length.

To encapsulate the codebase, Python supports the use of whitespace through indentation, which enhances code readability and helps identify blocks of code that belong to distinct logical segments. Notably, Python differs from many other programming languages by employing indentation as a means of block structuring, rather than braces or other explicit delimiters. 

You typically use a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) to write Python code, and then execute the code either by directly running the script or by importing the desired functions/classes into a separate Python script that serves as the entry point for your application. 

Once you execute the code, the `strlen` function can be applied to a string, and it will return the length of that string, illustrating its core functionality.
