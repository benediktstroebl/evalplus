```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string """
    return len(string)
```
This Python script defines a function called `strlen` that takes a string input (`string: str`) and returns the length of that string. It uses the `len()` function to directly compute the number of characters in the input string, which is an efficient operation for strings stored as bytes or text. This function is defined as taking a string as input and returning an integer representing the length of that string, and is encapsulated with a docstring that describes its purpose and behavior via tests.
