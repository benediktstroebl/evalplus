```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Returns the length of a string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script provides a function termed `strlen` that takes a string object as an argument and returns an integer value representing the length of the given string. It utilizes the built-in `len()` function to calculate the number of characters within the string, including spaces, punctuation, and any other characters it contains. This function's usage is demonstrated through docstrings in the code, illustrating its behavior through examples.
