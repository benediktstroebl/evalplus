```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Return the number of characters in the string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script defines a function called `strlen` that takes a string s as an argument and returns the number of characters in the string. The `len()` function is a built-in Python function that returns the length of a given sequence, such as a string, list, or tuple. In this case, it's used to determine the length of the provided string `s`. 

The function is tested with the following sample inputs and expected outputs:
```python
>>> strlen('')
0
>>> strlen('abc')
3
>>> strlen('abcdef')
6
```

This version of the script is more concise and efficient, using a more straightforward method to achieve the same goal.
