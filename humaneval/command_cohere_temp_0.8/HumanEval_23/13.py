```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Return the length of the given string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script defines a function called `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of that string. This is achieved by using the `len()` function in Python, which returns the number of characters (including spaces and special characters) in the given string. 

This function is designed to adhere to the Python style guidelines, with the explicit inclusion of type hints on the function argument and return value, which improves code readability and maintainability. Additionally, the function includes a docstring that provides a clear and concise description of its purpose and behavior, enhancing code documentation.

If included, the script also contains corresponding tests that ensure the function behaves as expected and effectively computes the length of strings. Through these tests, it is confirmed that `strlen` correctly calculates the lengths of both empty strings and those with varying lengths. 
```python
def test_strlen():
    """Test the correct operation of strlen."""
    assert strlen("") == 0
    assert strlen("abc") == 3
    assert strlen("abcdef") == 6
```

When executing this code, the `test_strlen` function verifies that the `strlen` function appropriately calculates the length of different strings, further underscoring the reliability of the solution. Futher, this test suite helps validate the correctness of the `strlen` function and ensures it behaves as expected, making the code more robust and dependable. 
 Combined, this Python script provides a concise and reliable solution to the problem, along with robust tests to ensure its correct behavior.
