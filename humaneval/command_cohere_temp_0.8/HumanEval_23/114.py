```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns the length of the given string """
    return len(string)
```
This Python script defines a function named strlen that takes a string argument and returns the length of that string. It utilizes the built-in Python function len to determine the number of characters in the input string. 

This fundamental function is widely applicable and can be used to process various types of data, including text strings.
