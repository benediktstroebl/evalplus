```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns the length of a string """
    return len(string)
```
This Python script provides a function (`strlen`) that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of that string. This is achieved using the `len()` function, which is a built-in Python function that returns the number of items in a container, such as a string, list, or tuple. 

For readability, it includes a docstring that describes the purpose of the function, as well as example usage demonstrating how to use the `strlen` function with different inputs. These example outputs are also provided for confirmation:
```
>>> strlen('')
0
>>> strlen('abc')
3
```
