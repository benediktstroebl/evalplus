```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns the length of the given string """
    return len(string)
```
This Python function uses the built-in `len()` method to determine the number of characters in the input string. It efficiently calculates the length and returns the result as an integer. This method is highly optimized and provides a concise way to obtain the string length, making it a preferred choice for this task.
