```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Returns the length of a string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script provides a function termed `strlen` that takes a string object as an argument and returns an integer denoting the length of the string. The function utilizes the `len()` method specific to strings in Python, which directly calculates and returns the number of characters within the string. 

This fundamental function is applied in various contexts where a program requires knowing the length of a given string, such as in the manipulation of text data or the formulation of meaningful message displays. 

Note: This function does not take into account any cultural norms that may affect the count of readable characters, as it simply computes the numerical count of storage units constituting the string.
