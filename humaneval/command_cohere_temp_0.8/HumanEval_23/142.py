```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string """
    return len(string)
```
This Python script provides a function called `strlen` that takes a string input (`string: str`) and returns the length of that string. It uses the `len()` function to calculate the number of characters (including spaces and special characters) in the input string. 

The function is designed to provide a clear and consistent way to obtain the length of any given string, making it versatile and useful in various scenarios where you need to work with string lengths in your Python applications.
