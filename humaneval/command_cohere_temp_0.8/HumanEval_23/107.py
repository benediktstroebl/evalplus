```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns the length of a string. """
    return len(string)
```

This Python script provides a function (`strlen`) that takes a string as an argument and returns its length. The function leverages the `len()` function commonly used in Python to get the length of strings, thereby providing a quick and efficient way to determine the length of any given string. 

The function is encapsulated in a way that is both intuitive and readable, making it easily understandable by both seasoned developers and those still learning to code.  This comes in the form of a detailed function signature that indicates the expected input and return value, further augmented by a docstring providing additional context on what the function does and how it behaves. These documentation elements are important for maintaining code readability and comply with the coding standards for Python projects. 

To ensure this function is working properly, it's essential to test it against different inputs. Below is a brief showcase of some tests you can run to validate the function:
```python
# Test String Length With Non-Empty String
>>> strlen("Hello")
5

# Test String Length With Empty String
>>> strlen("")
0

# Test String Length With Single Char
>>> strlen("X")
1

# Test String Length With Several Chars
>>> strlen("Hello, World!")
13
```

As expected, these tests cover different scenarios, from empty strings to longer sentences, just to prove the functionality of the `strlen()` function. Each of these examples showcases a specific scenario that is commonly used to evaluate string-length functionality; the output confirms the expected return values. 

This kind of testing process is fundamental for every function, regardless of its complexity. By comprehensively testing functions, you can guarantee their reliability and robustness, thereby assuring an error-free experience across various environments and use cases.  This is paramount for maintaining the codebase quality and stability as the project grows and evolves.
