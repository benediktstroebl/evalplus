```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns the length of a string """
    return len(string)
```

This Python script provides a function termed `strlen` taking a string parameter and returning its length. The function utilizes the built-in Python `len()` method to calculate the number of characters in the provided string. It is a self-contained script as it does not rely on any external libraries and accomplishes the task solely through the `len()` function.

Here is an example of how to use the `strlen` function:
```python
>>> strlen("Hello, World!")
13
>>> strlen("")
0
>>> strlen("abc")
3
```

The example tests below showcase the correctness of the `strlen` function in returning the length of the given strings.
