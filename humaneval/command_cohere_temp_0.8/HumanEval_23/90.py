```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns the length of the given string """
    return len(string)
```

This Python script provides a function called `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of the string. It defines the function with a string parameter and an integer return type. The function uses the `len()` method to determine the length of the provided string and returns this length as an integer. 

The function is self-contained and does not rely on any external variables or contexts. It is a standalone function that can be executed independently, making it reusable in various parts of code. 

To pass corresponding tests, the function should correctly calculate the length of various strings, including empty and non-empty strings. Test cases are defined as inputs for the function with expected outputs that are compared to evaluate the function's correctness.
