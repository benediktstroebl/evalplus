```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns the length of the given string """
    return len(string)
```
This Python script provides a function termed `strlen` that takes a string object as an argument and returns an integer denoting the length of the string. The function utilizes the `len()` method, which is a built-in Python function used to determine the length of a given sequence, to calculate the length of the input string. It is a self-contained script as it performs the task of string length computation without relying on external variables or functions. 
The function includes a docstring that describes its purpose and showcases example usage through so-called "test pickles," abbreviated as ">>>." These are comments that are prefixed with the ">>>" token and allow you to write example code fragments and their expected output. In this case, the docstring indicates that the function returns the length of the input string when an empty string or a string with the character 'a' are passed to the function.
