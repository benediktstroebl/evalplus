```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Return the length of the given string.
    """
    return len(string)
```
The function directly uses the built-in Python `len()` function to determine the number of characters in the input string. This implements the same behavior as the specified problem statement. It is a direct and efficient solution to the problem. 

To verify the function's behavior, you can test it with example inputs in the same manner as shown in the original problem statement:
```python
>>> strlen('')
0
>>> strlen('abc')
3
```

If you need further assistance or want to test more complex scenarios, feel free to ask. This function is essential and foundational in Python programming, as it is directly related to text manipulation and processing.
