```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Return the length of the given string.
    """
    return len(string)
```
This Python function uses the built-in `len()` method to determine the number of characters in the provided string. It efficiently computes the length and returns an integer representing the string's length. This straightforward approach ensures consistent and reliable behavior for string length computation.
