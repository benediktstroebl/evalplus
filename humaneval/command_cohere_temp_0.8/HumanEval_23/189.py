```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Return the length of the given string.
    """
    return len(string)
```
This Python function uses the built-in `len()` method to return the number of characters (including spaces and special characters) in the input string. 
The function is self-contained and does not rely on any external dependencies or modules. 
It is a simple and efficient solution to retrieve the length of a string.
