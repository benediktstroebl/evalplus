```python
def strlen(s: str) -> int:
    """Returns the length of a string."""
    return len(s)
```

This Python script provides a function called `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns the string's length as an integer. It utilizes the `len()` function to calculate the number of characters in the given string. 

To ensure the function aligns with the problem, we can write a test script with the following code:
```python
def test_strlen():
    """Tests the correctness of the strlen function."""
    assert strlen("") == 0
    assert strlen("abc") == 3
```

By running this test script, you can verify that the `strlen` function operates as expected, effectively calculating the length of the provided strings. 
The function is also designed to be easily accessible for further analysis and can be seamlessly integrated into larger projects. Possessing a clear and consistent structure, the code snippet conforms to the Python coding standards, ensuring readability and maintainability.
