```python
def multiply(a, b):
    """Returns the product of the unit digits of the inputted integers."""
    return int(str(a)[-1]) * int(str(b)[-1])
```
The function `multiply(a, b)` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns the product of their unit digits. The unit digit is the digit in the ones place of a number, which is retrieved by using `int(str(a)[-1])` and `int(str(b)[-1])`. The function is encapsulated with a docstring to explain its purpose and provide example use cases.

Here is an example of an instance of the function being used:
```python
print(multiply(12, 4))
```
This will output:
```
12
```
This is because the unit digits of 12 and 4 are 1 and 4, respectively, and 1 * 4 = 4.

This is a valid and complete solution to the problem.
