```python
def multiply(a, b):
    dig1 = a % 10
    dig2 = b % 10
    product = dig1 * dig2
    if product >= 10:
        product = product % 10
    return product
```

The code directly multiplies the unit digits (`dig1 % 10` and `dig2 % 10`) to find the product. If the result is greater than or equal to 10, it iteratively reduces it to its unit digit using modulo (`product % 10`). This ensures the final result remains in the one's place, accurately reflecting the unit digit of the product. 

The unit digit multiplication algorithm is utilized to efficiently determine the solution and swiftly provide the anticipated outcome. This method excels at handling the discussed problematic case, making it highly appropriate for this particular scenario.
