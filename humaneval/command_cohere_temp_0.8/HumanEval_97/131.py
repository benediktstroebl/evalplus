```python
def multiply(a, b):
    """Returns the product of the unit digits of the inputted integers."""
    return int(str(a)[-1]) * int(str(b)[-1])
```
The code uses string manipulation to extract the last digit from each number using `str(a)[-1]` converting it to an integer using `int()`, and then multiplying them together. This approach avoids considering the entire number, and instead, it just focuses on the last digit that is being asked for in the prompt. 

The function strays away from the usual `def multiply(a, b)`: `a` and `b` are unused in the function and instead uses the last digit of each number to calculate the product of the unit digits. 

This is a more efficient way to solve the problem, it minimizes the amount of logic and thought required to complete the function. 

The code is also more concise and readable with only one line of code compared to the traditional way of completing this function which would have been:
```python
def multiply(a, b):
    result = 0
    while a > 0 or b > 0:
        if a % 10 != b % 10:
            return 0
        else:
            result = result * (a % 10) // (b % 10)
        a = a // 10
        b = b // 10
    return result
```
