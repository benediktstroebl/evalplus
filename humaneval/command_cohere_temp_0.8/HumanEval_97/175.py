```python
def multiply(a, b):
    dig1 = a % 10
    dig2 = b % 10
    product = dig1 * dig2
    if product > 9:
        product = product % 10
    return product
```

The function `multiply(a, b)` takes two integers `a` and `b` as arguments, extracts the unit digits of both numbers using the modulo operator (`%`), and then multiplies these unit digits. If the result of this multiplication is greater than 9, it means there's a two-digit number, so the function applies a further modulo operation to get the last digit of the result, which is the product of the unit digits. This self-contained function can be dropped into any Python environment to solve the given problem.
