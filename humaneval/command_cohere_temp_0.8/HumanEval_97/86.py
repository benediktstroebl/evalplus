```python
def multiply(a, b):
    dig1 = a % 10
    dig2 = b % 10
    product = dig1 * dig2
    if product > 9:
        product = product % 10
    return product
```

The function `multiply(a, b)` takes two integers `a` and `b` as arguments, extracts the unit digits of both numbers using the modulo operator (`%`), and then multiplies these unit digits. If the result of this multiplication is greater than 9, it means the unit digit of the final product would be less than 10, so the function applies a further modulo operation to keep the result in the range of 0 to 9 (i.e., the unit digits).

The unit digit multiplication rule is used to quickly calculate the product of two numbers without performing the full multiplication operation. This is a useful technique in mental arithmetic and for solving various mathematical problems.

This code will compile and run successfully without any errors, and it will output the product of the unit digits of the two numbers according to the specification provided. 

**NOTE:** This assumption is made that the inputs are valid integers, which the prompt states are assumed to be true. If the inputs are not valid integers, like decimals or strings, this code would fail. But, since the assumption is made that the inputs are valid, the function assumes the inputs will be valid integers.  If you have concerns or want to prepare for potential edge cases, feel free to ask for guidance on how to handle them.
