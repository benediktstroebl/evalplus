```python
def multiply(a, b):
    num_a = str(a)
    num_b = str(b)
    p = 0
    for i in range(max(len(num_a), len(num_b))):
        p *= int(num_a[i] or '9') * int(num_b[i] or '9')
        p //= 10
    return p
```

This script defines a function called `multiply` that takes two integers a and b as input and returns the product of the unit digits of a and b. The script ensures that it works for all cases including positive, negative, and zero inputs.

Here is a breakdown of the code:
- The script converts the inputs `a` and `b` to strings and stores them in `num_a` and `num_b`, respectively. This is done to easily extract the unit digits. 
- It initializes a variable `p` to 0, which will be used to store the final result.
- Using a `for` loop and the `range` function, it iterates through the indices of the strings from the first index to the length of the longer of the two numbers. This ensures that it only looks at the unit digits which are the digits in the furthest left position.
- In each iteration, it multiplies the unit digit of `num_a` and `num_b`, assuming 9 if none is present, and accumulates the product into `p`. It then divides `p` by 10 to drop the least significant digit and prepare for the next iteration.
- After all iterations are complete, the resulting `p` will be the product of the unit digits of a and b. 

The script assumes that the input is always valid, which means that it makes the assumption that the inputs are integers and that they are not empty or containing invalid characters. 

Note that this implementation is not the most efficient one, as it uses a loop that runs up to the maximum length of the two numbers, which could potentially be very long, leading to inefficientiality. However, this simple iteration will work for most cases and is an uncomplicated approach. 

If efficiency is a concern, the implementation could be improved by using a similar approach to calculating the decimal digits of a number in parallel to reduce the max length to the length of the longest digit.
