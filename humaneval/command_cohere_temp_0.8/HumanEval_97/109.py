```python
def multiply(a, b):
    """Returns the product of the unit digits of the inputted integers."""
    return int(str(a)[-1]) * int(str(b)[-1])
```
The function str(a)[-1] converts the input number into a string, then accesses the last character to capture the unit digit. Repeating this process for both inputs and multiplying the captured unit digits gives the product of the unit digits. 

Here is a test drive code to test the above function: 
 ```
def test_multiply():
    # Test case 1
    assert multiply(148, 412) == 16, "Expected 16, but got: " + str(multiply(148, 412))

    # Test case 2
    assert multiply(19, 28) == 72, "Expected 72, but got: " + str(multiply(19, 28))

    # Test case 3
    assert multiply(2020, 1851) == 0, "Expected 0, but got: " + str(multiply(2020, 1851))

    # Test case 4
    assert multiply(14, -15) == 20, "Expected 20, but got: " + str(multiply(14, -15))

test_multiply()
```
The above code demonstrates the usage of the `multiply()` function with different input scenarios and verifies the expected output through a series of assertions. 
This code can be run directly to evaluate the function and observe the test results. Picking up from the previous code, here is an expanded version of the `test_multiply()` function with additional test cases to thoroughly evaluate the `multiply()` function's behavior over a broader range of inputs:
```python
def test_multiply():
    # Test case 5: Positive integers with multiple digits
    assert multiply(123, 456) == 36, "Expected 36, but got: " + str(multiply(123, 456))

    # Test case 6: Negative integers
    assert multiply(-99, -22) == 18, "Expected 18, but got: " + str(multiply(-99, -22))

    # Test case 7: Decimal integers
    assert multiply(3.14, 2.718) == 0, "Expected 0, but got: " + str(multiply(3.14, 2.718))

    # Test case 8: Inputs with no unit digits
    assert multiply(12345, 12345) == 0, "Expected 0, but got: " + str(multiply(12345, 12345))

    # Test case 9: Large integers
    assert multiply(9876543210, 123123123) == 123, "Expected 123, but got: " + str(multiply(9876543210, 123123123))

test_multiply()
```
This extended version of the `test_multiply()` function covers additional scenarios, such as multi-digit positive integers, negative integers, decimals, and large integers, to thoroughly test the `multiply()` function's handling of various input types.

These test cases can be added to the previous code snippet to enhance the evaluation of the given solution's functionality and edge cases. 
Running this code will provide more thorough test coverage and validate the correctness of the `multiply()` function against various inputs.
