```python
def multiply(a, b):
    """Returns the product of the unit digits of the inputs."""
    return int(str(a)[-1]) * int(str(b)[-1])
```
The code directly multiplies the last digits of the integers represented by `a` and `b`. The result is then returned as an integer to prevent any decimal losses, ensuring the accuracy of the calculation. The function is encapsulated with a helpful comment that describes its purpose, making the code easier to understand. Overall, the clarity and brevity of the code make it well-structured and optimized for the given problem.
