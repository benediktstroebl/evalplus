```python
def multiply(a, b):
    dig1 = a % 10
    dig2 = b % 10
    product = (dig1 * dig2) % 10
    return product
```

The code directly computes the product of the unit digits of `a` and `b` and returns the result, ensuring it fits the bill for the specified examples. It utilizes the modulo (`%`) operator to determine the unit digit, drastically simplifying the computation. This approach leverages the intrinsic nature of unit digits, where multiplication is easier to comprehend and compute on a smaller scale. The resulting function is concise and efficient, embodying the essence of functional programming. 

This approach adheres to the **functional style** of programming, where operations are stateless, pure, and highly composable. By focusing on individual digits, it underscores the concept of decoupling components for easier understanding and maintenance. It also adheres to the **divide and conquer** principle, as the problem is broken down into manageable parts, making it easier to solve.
