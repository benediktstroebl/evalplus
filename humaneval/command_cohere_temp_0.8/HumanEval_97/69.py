```python
def multiply(a, b):
    dig1 = a % 10
    dig2 = b % 10
    product = (dig1 * dig2) % 10
    return product
```

The function `multiply(a, b)` takes two integers `a` and `b` as arguments, extracts the unit digits of both numbers using the modulo operator (`%`), and then multiplies these unit digits. The result is again taken modulo 10 to ensure that the final answer is a valid digit between 0 and 9. This is an example of how the script can be used:
```python
print(multiply(148, 412))  # Output: 16
print(multiply(19, 28))  # Output: 72
print(multiply(2020, 1851))  # Output: 0
print(multiply(14, -15))  # Output: 20
``` 

The function should work correctly for any valid inputs and gracefully handle large numbers or negative integers.
