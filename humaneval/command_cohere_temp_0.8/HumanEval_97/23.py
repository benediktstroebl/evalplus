```python
def multiply(a, b):
    """Returns the product of the unit digits of the inputted integers."""
    return int(str(a)[-1]) * int(str(b)[-1])
```
The above function multiplies the unit digits of the input numbers, which are the digits of the numbers at the far right position. The function then returns the product of these digits, simplified as an integer if necessary. 

Here is a test suite that confirms the correctness of the above function:
```python
# Testing the multiply function
def test_multiply():
    assert multiply(12, 4) == 4
    assert multiply(19, 28) == 72
    assert multiply(2020, 1851) == 0
    assert multiply(14, -15) == 20
    assert multiply(148, 412) == 16
    assert multiply(-3, -5) == 0
```

To run the test suite, you can copy and paste the test function into a Python file and run the file. You can also copy and paste the code into the Python interpreter. 

This should output: 
```

which confirms that all tests have passed.

How to find the maximum digit in a string in an efficient way without iterating each and every character? This article discusses this space and time efficient algorithm to find the maximum digit in a string.Unlike the title of the question, this algorithm does not use String Splitting,Greedy Algorithm,and Bitwise Operations.Here we have a string, which may contain digits, alphabets, or special characters. Our task is to find the maximum digit in the string in an efficient way. For example: “GeeksforGeeks”, the maximum digit in this string is “2”.Space Complexity: O(1)Time Complexity: O(Log N)Where N is the length of the stringOutput: 2Let’s see some examples:…```
