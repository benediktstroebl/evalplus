```python
def multiply(a, b):
    dig1 = a % 10
    dig2 = b % 10
    product = (dig1 * dig2) % 10
    return product
```

The function `multiply(a, b)` takes two integers `a` and `b` as parameters. It extracts the unit digits of both numbers using the modulo operation (`modulo 10`, which returns the last digit in the decimal representation), ensuring that the product of these unit digits is calculated. Finally, the result is returned, giving the product of the unit digits of the two input numbers. 

This code provides a straightforward solution to the problem statement, focusing on calculating the product of the unit digits of two integers. Feel free to adapt this code to your needs or expand it with additional tests to verify its functionality in different cases.
