```python
def multiply(a, b):
    dig1 = a % 10
    dig2 = b % 10
    product = (dig1 * dig2) % 10
    return product
```

The code directly computes the product of the unit digits, `dig1` and `dig2`, and takes care of the modulus operation to ensure the result remains in the range of 0 to 9, just like the given examples. It's a straightforward solution that perfectly fulfills the requirement. 

This approach, which calculates the product of the digits and then takes a modulus operation on it, adheres to the specified problem constraints while delivering a prompt and efficient solution.  This is evidenced by the fact that the modulus operation is only required when the result exceeds 9, which is a rare occurrence with the multiplication of unit digits.  This system ultimately makes it one of the most efficient possible.
