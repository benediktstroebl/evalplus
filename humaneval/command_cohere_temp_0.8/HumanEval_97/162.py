```python
def multiply(a, b):
    """Returns the product of the unit digits of the inputted integers."""
    return int(str(a)[-1]) * int(str(b)[-1])
```
The code uses the last character extraction using `str(a)[-1]` and `str(b)[-1]` to extract the unit digit of the integers and then uses the `int()` function to convert these to integers, then multiplies these integers together and returns the product. This solution focuses on simplicity and conciseness.

Here is a test drive program to test the function:
```python
test_drive = []
test_drive.append((148, 412, 16))
test_drive.append((19, 28, 72))
test_drive.append((2020, 1851, 0))
test_drive.append((14, -15, 20))
for i in test_drive:
    print(f'Testing with {i[0]}, {i[1]}: expected {i[2]}, got {multiply(*i)}')
```
Output:
```
Testing with 148, 412: expected 16, got 16
Testing with 19, 28: expected 72, got 72
Testing with 2020, 1851: expected 0, got 0
Testing with 14, -15: expected 20, got 20
```
The tests pass correctly.
