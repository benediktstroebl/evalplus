```python
def multiply(a, b):
    dig1 = a % 10
    dig2 = b % 10
    product = (dig1 * dig2) % 10
    return product
```

The code directly computes the product of the unit digits of `a` and `b` and returns the result, without the need for intermediate variables or complex calculations. It efficiently completes the task in a straightforward manner.
