```python
def multiply(a, b):
    dig1 = a % 10
    dig2 = b % 10
    product = (dig1 * dig2) % 10
    return product
```

The code directly computes the product of the unit digits of `a` and `b` and returns the result. This is done using the modulo operator `%` to ensure that the result remains in the range of 0 to 9, representing the unit digit of the product. 

The function skips the unnecessary check for negative numbers and uses a more direct approach to calculating the product of the unit digits, making the code more efficient and readable. 

This solution is optimized for readability and efficiency and solves the given problem in a straightforward manner. 

The `def multiply(a, b):` defines a function named multiply that takes two arguments `a` and `b`. The `dig1 = a % 10` and `dig2 = b % 10` extracts the last digit of each number, and `product = (dig1 * dig2) % 10` calculates the product of these last digits, then takes the modulo 10 to ensure the result is within the range of 0 to 9, which represents the unit digit of the product. Finally, the `return product` returns the calculated unit digit of the product.
