```python
def multiply(a, b):
    dig1 = a % 10
    dig2 = b % 10
    product = (dig1 * dig2) % 10
    return product
```

The function `multiply(a, b)` takes two integers `a` and `b` as arguments, extracts the unit digits of both numbers using the modulo operator (`%`), and then multiplies these unit digits. The result is again taken modulo 10 to ensure it fits within a single digit and is then returned. This simplified approach directly computes the product of the unit digits without relying on any intermediate variables or additional steps. 

The unit tests provided as part of the prompt can be used to verify the correctness of the implementation. The expected output for each test case is included in the original problem statement.
