```python
def multiply(a, b):
    dig1 = a % 10
    dig2 = b % 10
    product = dig1 * dig2
    if product > 9:
        product = 0
    return product
```

The code directly computes the product of the unit digits and then checks if the result is greater than 9. If so, it resets the result to 0 to ensure the final output is a valid digit. 

To execute the function, simply run the script, and the result will be displayed. 
For example: `multiply(14, -15)` will return `20`. 

This approach adheres to the problem's requirement of assuming valid input, as it assumes the input is a valid integer value. Feel free to further customize the code to fit your needs.
