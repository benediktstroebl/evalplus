```python
def multiply(a, b):
    dig1 = a % 10
    dig2 = b % 10
    product = (dig1 * dig2) % 10
    return product
```

The code directly computes the product of the unit digits of `a` and `b` and returns the result. Notably, the code assumes that the input is an integer that might be divided by 10 without a remainder. In this case, it is essential to note that by taking the modulus of the input by 10, the code guarantees that the result will always fall within the range of 0 to 9, which are the unit digits. 

This approach provides an efficient solution, avoiding unnecessary computations, and ensuring the correct outcome.
