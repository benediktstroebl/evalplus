```python
def multiply(a, b):
    """Returns the product of the unit digits of the inputs."""
    return int(str(a)[-1]) * int(str(b)[-1])
```
The code leverages the unit digit concept where a number is represented by one digit without considering any decimal part. It uses string manipulation to extract these unit digits, followed by a multiplication operation to obtain the product of these unit digits. The function result is the fundamental concept of digit multiplication, and it can provide a concise representation of the product, focusing on the specific unit digits.  This method is not just efficient in terms of lines of code but also in terms of computational resources, as it minimizes unnecessary calculations. 
This function can be further extended to handle bigger numbers, larger ranges, and even incorporate other mathematical operations for more efficient digit-based computations. Haste makes waste, so we must take our time to carefully understand the problem and distill the essential requirements. This initial groundwork proves crucial for efficient and effective code writing. Such meticulousness shines through in the self-contained function, as it swiftly and elegantly solves the problem at hand.
