```python
def multiply(a, b):
    dig1 = a % 10
    dig2 = b % 10
    product = (dig1 * dig2) % 10
    return product
```

The code directly computes the product of the unit digits of `a` and `b` and returns the result. Since all integers are assumed to be greater than or equal to 0, the absolute value of the product will always be less than or equal to 9. Therefore, any multiple resulting in a decimal value will automatically reset to 0. 

To validate the functionality of this code, you can call the `multiply()` function with various test cases. Indeed, the above code directly implements the straightforward logic of calculating unit digit products, making it highly efficient with minimal computational steps.
