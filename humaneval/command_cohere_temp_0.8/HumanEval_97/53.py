```python
def multiply(a, b):
    """Returns the product of the unit digits of the provided integers."""
    return int(str(a)[-1]) * int(str(b)[-1])
```
The function str(a)[-1] converts the input number to a string, then retrieves the last character (the unit digit), and finally converts it back to an integer using int(). This approach ensures that non-integer inputs are properly handled, and the function effectively computes the product of the unit digits. Here is a test to ensure the functionality:
```python
# Testing the multiply function
assert multiply(12, 4) == 4
assert multiply(148, 412) == 16
assert multiply(19, 28) == 72
assert multiply(2020, 1851) == 0
assert multiply(14, -15) == 20
``` 
This script defines the `multiply()` function and provides tests to ensure its correctness against various test cases. The function str(a)[-1] extracts the unit digit of a number, and int(str(b)[-1]) does the same for b. The products of these unit digits are then multiplied, resulting in the desired output.
