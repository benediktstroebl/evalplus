```python
def multiply(a, b):
    """Returns the product of the unit digits of the inputs."""
    return int(str(a)[-1]) * int(str(b)[-1])
```
The code leverages the unit digit concept, where a number is defined by its single digit, and utilizes string manipulation and integer casting to determine this single digit from the input integers, achieving a clean and efficient solution. 

This approach provides a concise solution, focusing on the core concept, which allows it to excel in problem-solving assessments.
