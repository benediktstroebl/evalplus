Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def modp(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)

# Tests
assert modp(3, 5) == 3
assert modp(1101, 101) == 2
assert modp(0, 101) == 1
assert modp(3, 11) == 8
assert modp(100, 101) == 1
```

The `modp` function takes two integers `n` and `p` as input and returns `2^n modulo p` using the `pow` function and concentrates on passing the test cases.

Feel free to uncomment the test cases to validate the function against your expected outputs. Let me know if you need further clarification or have additional questions!
