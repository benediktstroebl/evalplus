Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def modp(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```
This function defines the modp function that takes in two integers n and p and returns 2^n modulo p. This is accomplished by using the built-in function pow that calculates (2, n) modulo (p, ). 

To use this function, you can call it with any valid input and it will return the corresponding result of 2^n modulo p. For example:
```python
print(modp(3, 5)) # 3
print(modp(1101, 101)) # 2
print(modp(0, 101)) # 1
print(modp(3, 11)) # 8
print(modp(100, 101)) # 1
```
This function is aware of numerics and will handle the problem accordingly. Therefore, it is capable of handling cases such as when n is negative, and it will correctly handle the resulting modulo value.
