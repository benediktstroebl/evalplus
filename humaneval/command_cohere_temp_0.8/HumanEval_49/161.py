Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def modp(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```
This script defines the modp function, which takes in two integers n and p and returns 2^n modulo p. It utilizes the built-in pow function to compute the result. 

To use this script, you can call the modp function with the input values for n and p, and it will return the corresponding result. For example:
```python
result = modp(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 3
```
To test the function, you can also execute the same lines of code with different inputs and verify the respective outputs. 

Note: Make sure to have the necessary libraries installed to use the pow function. If using Python 3, you may need to include the from __future__ import division statement at the beginning of your code to ensure the division operator behaves as expected.
