```python
def modp(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```

This function `modp(n, p)` computes `2^n % p` by leveraging the built-in function `pow()`. The result is obtained straightforwardly, avoiding any messy numeric issues and delivering the expected behavior as testified in the given test cases.  This method is both effective and legible, enabling the problem to be solved with a minimum of code.  The tests testify to its correctness, confirming that it fulfills the challenge as specified.  You can use this function to solve the problem statement.  You can do so by calling the function with the input numbers 'n' and 'p' as follows:
```python
result = modp(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 3

result = modp(1101, 101)
print(result)  # Output: 2

result = modp(0, 101)
print(result)  # Output: 1

result = modp(3, 11)
print(result)  # Output: 8

result = modp(100, 101)
print(result)  # Output: 1
```
This would print the corresponding outputs 3, 2, 1, 8, and 1 respectively.  This demonstrates the correctness of the function in solving the problem as stated.  You can also use the function with other input values to solve the problem as needed.  This can be done by calling the function with the new input values and storing the results in the 'result' variable, as we have done in the previous examples.  You may then use these results in the appropriate manner or proceed with additional calculations as required by the specific application or problem context.  This function is flexible and can be used to efficiently and accurately solve the problem anytime it is required.  This can be particularly useful for streamlining processes or procedures that require this specific mathematical operation.  This can save time and effort and improve efficiency in dealing with such numeric challenges.  Additionally, it can help to avoid any potential pitfalls or errors when working with powers and modulo operations in Python, since it leverages the built-in `pow()` function to guarantee the correct numerical results.  This can help to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the calculations in your application.  This can be particularly important when dealing with sensitive or critical numeric data.  This can also help to minimize computational overhead and enhance the performance of your Python applications when dealing with such operations.
