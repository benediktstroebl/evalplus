```python
def modp(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```

This function `modp(n, p)` computes `2` raised to the power of `n` and takes the result modulo `p`. It leverages the built-in Python function `pow()` to raise `2` to the power of `n` and then takes the result modulo `p` through arithmetic subtraction. 

The `pow()` function is used widely in Python to raise a given number to a non-negative exponent. In this case, the base is `2`, the exponent is `n`, and the modulus is `p`. This completes the task of calculating `2^n % p`. 

This function is self-contained and does not require any external libraries or modules. It is simple, direct, and easy to understand. 

To handle any potential numeric issues, it's a good practice to ensure that the input values `n` and `p` are integers. This can be easily done using the `int()` function, as shown in the accompanying tests. 
```python
# Tests
assert int(modp(3, 5)) == 3
assert int(modp(1101, 101)) == 2
assert int(modp(0, 101)) == 1
assert int(modp(3, 11)) == 8
assert int(modp(100, 101)) == 1
``` 

These tests validate the function's behavior against a range of scenarios and ensure its correctness. In the tests, the `int()` function is used to cast the result as an integer, which is necessary since the `pow()` function returns a float by default. 

Please note that the `modp` function assumes that the input values `n` and `p` are integers and that the exponent `n` is a non-negative integer. 

If the input values are not integers or the exponent is negative, the function may raise an error or return an incorrect result. In such cases, further preprocessing or error handling may be necessary.  Any potential limitations or specific assumptions of the Python `pow()` function with regard to the modulus or negative exponents should also be considered when using this function in other contexts. 
```python
# Example usage
>> modp(3, 5)
3
>> modp(1101, 101)
2
>> modp(0, 101)
1
>> modp(3, 11)
8
>> modp(100, 101)
1
```

The example usage demonstrates the function's behavior and verifies its correctness through these tests.  In practice, this function can be used as a handy and efficient helper to compute `2^n % p` in a variety of contexts, from cryptography to number theory and beyond.  Any complex numerical computations or performance-critical scenarios, it may be worth profiling the function's performance and evaluating whether optimizations are possible.
