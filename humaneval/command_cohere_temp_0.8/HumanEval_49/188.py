```python
def modp(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```

This Python expression employs the built-in `pow` function to calculate `2` raised to the power of `n` modulo `p`, leveraging the numerics of the latter for efficient modular exponentiation. 

Such a method is both concise and readily accessible due to Python's extensive built-in functions, eliminating the need for manual exponentiation or iterative processes. 

You can directly incorporate this code within your Python project and utilize the `modp` function to swiftly compute 2^n modulo p for any given values of n and p.
