```python
def modp(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```

This script defines a Python function called `modp` taking two integers `n` and `p` as inputs. It utilizes the `pow` function to calculate `2` raised to the power of `n` modulo `p`, ensuring the result falls within the range of `p`. This is particularly useful when dealing with modular arithmetic, especially for tasks involving recursive relationships, pattern recognition, and optimization problems.
