Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def modp(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```
This function accepts two integers as inputs, namely `n` and `p`, and returns `2` raised to the power of `n` modulo `p` using the Python operator `pow`.  This operator yields the rightmost numerical value for numerical operands, and this value is calculated moduloedly for the operands with common numeric types. A modulo operation finds the remainder when one number is divided by another. It is denoted by the '%' sign in Python. This function is implemented to solve the given problem and is self-contained, meaning it can be run as a standalone Python script.  It is also deterministic, meaning that it will produce the same output for a given input every time. 

Here's an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> modp(3, 5)
3
>>> modp(1101, 101)
2
>>> modp(0, 101)
1
>>> modp(3, 11)
8
>>> modp(100, 101)
1
```
This shows the function's behavior for different inputs. Specifically, it shows that the function returns the correct result for the test cases provided in the original problem statement.  This is because the power operator (`^`) in Python is defined such that, for positive integers `x` and `y`, `x^y = 1` if `y` is 0, and `x^y % m` if `y` is positive and `x` and `m` are positive integers with `m` being odd, where `m` is denoted by the modulo operator `%`. Since the result of `2^n` is always even, and `p` is odd in this problem, the result of `2^n % p` equals `2^n - 1`, which is the result desired by the problem statement. 

This function is a basic example of how to solve the given problem in Python. It is important to note that this function assumes that both inputs are integers. If this is not the case, you may need to convert the inputs to integers before running the function.  It also assumes that the modulo arithmetic is performed on integers. If this is not the case, you may need to cast the operands to integers before performing the modulo operation.  This is a known limitation of the Python `pow` operator. It is also worth noting that for efficiency and computational complexity reasons, this function performs all computations internally as integers.  If the numeric types of the inputs do not happen to be integers, Python first casts them to integers and then proceeds with the computations, as described.  This makes it a relatively simple function to use and understand.  This function can be used as a starting point and modified to solve more complex problems involving exponentiation and modulo operations.  It is also a good example of a function that is self-contained but also deterministic, resilient, and interpretable.  These qualities make it a good building block for more complex functionalities in Python.  It is also a good example of how to use Python's built-in functions to solve a problem simply and elegantly.  Finally, it can be scaled and optimized for more complex and demanding applications, should the need arise.  This makes it a versatile building block for Python development. 
To further enhance the robustness of this function, edge cases and corner cases should also be accounted for to ensure that the function behaves correctly for unexpected inputs. These might include, for example, scenarios where `n` or
