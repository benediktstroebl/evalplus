```python
def modp(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```

This script defines a Python function called `modp` that takes two integers `n` and `p` as input. It utilizes the `pow` function to calculate `2` raised to the power of `n` and then computes the result modulo `p`. This modular arithmetic operation ensures that the result fits within the range of `p`, addressing potential numerical issues.

Here's an example of how you can use the `modp` function:
```python
result = modp(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 3
```

In this example, the function computes 2^3 (which is 8) and then takes the result modulo 5, resulting in 3.

This function is versatile and can be used for various modular arithmetic computations involving powers of 2 and has been designed to handle cases where the input values may cause overflow in regular integer arithmetic. 

Ensure that you have Python and the necessary math libraries installed to use this code, and feel free to adapt it for specific use cases.
