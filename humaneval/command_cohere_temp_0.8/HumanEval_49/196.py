```python
def modp(n, p):
    return (1 << n) % p
```

This function takes two integers ``n`` and ``p`` as arguments, and returns the remainder of the division of ``2^n`` by ``p``. This is accomplished by using the modulo operator ``%`` after calculating ``2^n`` using the bitwise exponentiation operator ``<<``. This expression ``(1 << n) % p`` calculates the result of the modulo operation in a more efficient manner compared to using the pow function, as it does not make extra calls to Python's math module, resulting in a faster execution time. 

Here's a test suite to ensure the function behaves as expected:
```python
# Tests for the modp function
def test_modp():
    assert modp(0, 101) == 1
    assert modp(3, 5) == 3
    assert modp(1101, 101) == 2
    assert modp(3, 11) == 8
    assert modp(100, 101) == 1
    assert modp(32, 33) == 1
    assert modp(63, 64) == 0
    assert modp(62, 64) == 62
    assert modp(33, 65) == 32
    assert modp(32, -33) == -1
    assert modp(63, -64) == 0
    assert modp(62, -64) == -62
    assert modp(33, -65) == -32
``` 

To run the test suite, navigate to the directory containing the script and run the test.py file using the Python interpreter. The test suite will execute each test case and display a summary of the results, including the number of executed tests and the number of failures, if any. 

This approach ensures that the ``modp`` function behaves as expected with various inputs.
