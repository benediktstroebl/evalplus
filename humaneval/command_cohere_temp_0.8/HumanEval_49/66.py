```python
def modp(n, p):
    return (1 << n) % p
```

This function takes two arguments, `n` and `p`, and returns the result of multiplying 2 by itself `n` times and then taking the remainder when divided by `p`. This is accomplished by using the modulo operator `%` after performing the bitwise multiplication operation `1 << n`.

The modulo operator `%` returns the remainder when the numerator is divided by the denominator. In this case, the function is calculating the remainder of (1 << n) divided by p.

For example, if `n = 3` and `p = 5`, the function would return (1 << 3) % 5, which equals 3. This is because 2 * 2 * 2 % 5 equals 3.

This function is also robust against non-negative values of `n` and any integer value of `p`. However, it's important to note that the function assumes valid input and behaves unpredictably when given incorrect or out-of-range inputs. Input validation and error handling are crucial for ensuring the function's behavior in production code.
