```python
def modp(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```

This function `modp(n, p)` is defined to return the value of `2^n` modulo `p` using the built-in Python function `pow(x, y, p)` which calculates `x` raised to the power of `y` modulo `p`. 

It would be important to be aware of potential numeric issues, as the function doesn't handle edge cases like `n < 0` or `p == 1`, which would lead to errors or undefined behaviors. 

To mitigate this, it would be important to ensure that inputs like `n` and `p` are validated and sanitized before they are passed to this function to ensure they are valid and appropriate for the desired mathematical operation.
