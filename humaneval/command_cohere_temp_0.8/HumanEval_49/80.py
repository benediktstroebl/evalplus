```python
def modp(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```

This script defines a Python function called `modp` that takes two integers `n` and `p` as input. It utilizes the `pow` function to calculate 2 raised to the power of `n` modulo `p`, ensuring the result falls within the range of `p`. This is a common technique in number theory to perform exponentiation while maintaining a result within a specific range.

The function's behavior is illustrated in the docstring, which includes illustrative use cases that reflect the behavior of the modp function for various inputs. These use cases demonstrate the function's ability to compute the specified power modulo a given value, showcasing its utility in various modular arithmetic scenarios.
