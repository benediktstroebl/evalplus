```python
def modp(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```

This function `modp(n, p)` uses the `pow()` function to calculate `2` to the power of `n` modulo `p`, following the prompt instructions. It's designed to work for positive integers `n` and `p`, returning the result as described in the prompt. 

This solution is concise and efficient, directly solving the problem statement without any additional complexity or considerations mentioned in the multi-line comment. It's important to note that the solution assumes valid input and behaves as expected for edge cases like negative numbers, floating-point numbers, or invalid numeric values; additional input validation and handling may be necessary in real-world scenarios. 

If the problem context or requirements change, this solution can serve as a starting point for further refinement or modification based on specific needs. 

This code assumes that valid integers are provided for `n` and `p`, as excessive values for `n` could result in floating-point numbers or special values (e.g., NaN, Infinity), and `p` is constrained by the resulting modulus being an integer within its bounds. 

These considerations may not be covered by the provided solution, as it focuses on the core problem of calculating 2^n modulo p. It's always recommended to thoroughly test the solution with various inputs and address any specific constraints or limitations based on the problem context and expected input scenarios.
