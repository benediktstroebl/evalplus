```python
def modp(n, p):
    return (1 << n) % p
```

This function takes two integers **n** and **p** as arguments, and returns the calculation of `2` raised to the power of **n** and then taken modulo **p**. This is done using the modulo operator `%`. 

For example, given the input arguments `n = 3` and `p = 5`, the function would compute `2` raised to the power of `3`, which is `8`, and then take the remainder when divided by `5`, which is `3`. 

Would you like to know more about the `modp` function or its uses? Let me know and I'll provide more information or suggestions on how you might apply it in different scenarios. Feel free to ask any questions!
