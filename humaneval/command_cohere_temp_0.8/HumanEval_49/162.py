```python
def modp(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```

This script defines a Python function called `modp` that takes two integers `n` and `p` as input and returns the result of calculating the exponentiation of 2 to the power of `n` and then taking the result modulo `p`. This is achieved by using the built-in Python function `pow`, which calculates the exponentiation, and then the modulo operator `%`, which calculates the remainder when dividing the result by `p`. 

This function is called with various arguments and results in the given markdown code block, ensuring that it produces the correct results and meets the problem requirements.
