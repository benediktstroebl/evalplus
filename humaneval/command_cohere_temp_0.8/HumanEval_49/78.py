Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def modp(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)

# Tests
assert modp(3, 5) == 3
assert modp(1101, 101) == 2
assert modp(0, 101) == 1
assert modp(3, 11) == 8
assert modp(100, 101) == 1
```

The `modp` function takes two integers `n` and `p` as input and returns `2^n modulo p` using the `pow` function and accomplishes the task. The test suite aims to validate the function's correctness against various scenarios.

This solution is efficient in terms of time and space complexity, making it suitable for practical applications.
