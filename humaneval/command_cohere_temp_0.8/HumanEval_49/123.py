Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def modp(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```
This function adheres to the problem statement, calculating 2^n modulo p using the built-in `pow` function and returning the result. It requires no additional dependencies or modifications to numerical settings. The function is self-contained and ready to use as stated. If you would like to test this function with example scenarios, you can incorporate it into a test script or integrate it with an existing solution.
