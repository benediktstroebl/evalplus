Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def modp(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```
This function accepts two integers as inputs and utilizes the `pow` function to calculate 2 raised to the power of n modulo p. This solution is concise and effectively solves the problem, as evidenced by the provided test cases, all of which are successfully passed. 

You can use the `pow` function with the third argument modulo the base and the exponent to calculate the result modulo p. 
Here is an example of how you can use the modp function:
```python
>>> modp(3, 5)
3
>>> modp(1101, 101)
2
>>> modp(0, 101)
1
>>> modp(3, 11)
8
>>> modp(100, 101)
1
```
The above example test cases are also valid and correctly implemented in the function. This approach eliminates the potential issues associated with manual exponentiation, such as integer overflow. 
It also ensures that the result is correctly calculated modulo the given prime number. 
This makes the function more efficient and reduces the chances of encountering numeric issues. 
This approach also makes the code easier to read and more maintainable.
