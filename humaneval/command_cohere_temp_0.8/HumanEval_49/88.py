```python
def modp(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```

This function `modp(n, p)` uses the `pow` function to calculate `2` raised to the power of `n` modulo `p`. It's an efficient way to perform this operation and is readily available in Python's math library. Remember that this function assumes numeric integers for `n` and `p`. 

This solution is straightforward and effective, especially for simple problems like this one. Let me know if you'd like me to explain any part of the solution or provide additional assistance.
