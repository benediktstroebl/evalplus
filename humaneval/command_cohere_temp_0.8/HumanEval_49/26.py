```python
def modp(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```

This script defines a Python function called `modp` taking two integers `n` and `p` as inputs. It utilizes the `pow` function to calculate `2` raised to the power of `n` modulo `p`, ensuring the result falls within the range of `p`. 

This function is designed to perform exponentiation within the context of modular arithmetic, a common operation in number theory and cryptography. 

It efficiently computes the result of raising `2` to the specified power, modulo a given prime number `p`, demonstrating its utility in various mathematical and computational scenarios. 

This implementation is concise and accomplishes the task with the utmost efficiency. It provides a reusable and adaptable function for performing modular exponentiation in Python, aiding in various mathematical and computational tasks.
