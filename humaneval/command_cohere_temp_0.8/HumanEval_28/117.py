# Defining a function to concatenate a list of strings into a single string
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    concatenated_string = ''
    for string in strings:
        concatenated_string += f"{string}"
    return concatenated_string


# The following tests are provided to ensure the function behaves as expected:
>>> concatenate([])
''
>>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
'abc'
```

This script defines a function called `concatenate` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string concatenated from the input list. The function is tested with two examples, namely an empty list and a list of three letters, and it successfully passes both tests.
