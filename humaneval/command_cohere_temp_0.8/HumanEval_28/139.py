```python
# Importing the necessary module
from typing import List

def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string.
    """
    result = ''.join(strings)
    return result
```

This Python script defines a function called `concatenate` that takes a list of strings (`List[str]`) as an argument and returns a single string. Inside the function, it uses the `join` method to concatenate the strings in the provided list with an empty separator ('') and stores the result in the `result` variable. The function then returns the `result`. 

The function is designed to handle an empty input list, and in that case, it returns an empty string. Additionally, when the input list contains elements 'a', 'b', and 'c', the function effectively concatenates these strings to produce the output 'abc'. 

This solution adheres to Python's type hinting framework, providing a clear and reliable function for concatenating strings and delivering a descriptive docstring to explain its functionality.
