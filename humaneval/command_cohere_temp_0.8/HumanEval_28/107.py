```python
# Retrieve the input list of strings
strings = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']

# Concatenate the strings in the list into a single string
result = ''.join(strings)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

This Python script defines a list of strings named `strings` and uses the `join` method to concatenate all the strings into a single string, with an empty space as the separator. The resulting concatenated string is then printed to the console. 

To match the specified tests, an empty list (`[]`) will result in an empty string (`''`), and a list containing three strings ('a', 'b', 'c') will yield the expected output 'abc'.
