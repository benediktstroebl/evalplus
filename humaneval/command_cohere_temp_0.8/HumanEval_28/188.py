```python
# The following code is adapted from https://stackoverflow.com/a/949563/187487 

from typing import List

def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    """
    result = ''
    for string in strings:
        result += string
    return result
```
This Python script provides a function called `concatenate` that takes a list of strings (`List[str]`) as input and returns a single string that concatenates all the inputs together. 

The function iterates through each string in the input list, adding them one after the other to the `result` string variable. The `result` string accumulates the characters of each string, creating a concatenated output. 

This solution is straightforward and effective, providing a unified string representation for input strings in Python.
