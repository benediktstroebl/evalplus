# Defining function
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    >>> concatenate([])

    >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'abc'
    """
    concatenated = ''.join(strings)
    return concatenated
```

This Python script defines a function called `concatenate` that takes a list of strings (`List[str]`) as input and returns a single string that concatenates all the strings in the list. The function uses the `join` method to join the strings in the list with a blank space as the separator.

The function is designed to be self-contained, meaning it does not depend on any external variables or functions. It is a standalone function that can be easily imported and used in other Python scripts. 

The function includes type hints and a docstring to provide information about the expected input and how the function works. The docstring includes examples of the function's behavior, which are automatically verified by the function's type hints.
