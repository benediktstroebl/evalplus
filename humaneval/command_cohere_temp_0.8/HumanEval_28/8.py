from typing import List

def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    """
    result = ''
    for string in strings:
        result += string
    return result
```
This function takes a list of strings, iterates through them, and appends each string to a result string, which is initially empty. The function returns the final result string. 

This approach guarantees that the function is self-contained, as it doesn't rely on any external variables or context. 

If you need to further clarify the function, you can add more precise tests. These tests can show edge cases and demonstrate how the function behaves with them.
