```python
# Import the necessary module
from typing import List

# The function to concatenate the strings in the list
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string.
    """
    # If the input list is empty, return an empty string
    if not strings:
        return ''
    # Otherwise, join the strings in the list with spaces and return the combined string
    return ' '.join(strings)

# Example usage
print(concatenate(['Hello', 'World']))  # Expected output: 'Hello World'
``` 

This code defines a function called `concatenate` which takes in a list of strings and returns a single string concatenated from the input list. The function checks if the input list is empty, and if so, it returns an empty string. Otherwise, it uses the `join` method to concatenate the strings in the list with a space separator, and returns the combined string. 

To demonstrate the functionality, the code prints the result of calling `concatenate` with the list of strings `['Hello', 'World']`. The expected output is `'Hello World'`, confirming the successful concatenation of the two strings with a space in between. 

This solution is self-contained, meaning all the necessary logic is included in the `concatenate` function, and it can be run independently without any external dependencies.  The code is also documented with a docstring, which describes the purpose of the function and provides example usage scenarios.  This makes the code both usable and understandable by other developers who might be integrating this function in their projects.
