```python
# Retrieve the input list of strings
strings = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'] 

# Use f-strings to concatenate strings in the list 
result = ''.join(f'{string}' for string in strings)

# Return the concatenated string
print(result)
```

This code uses an f-string to iterate through a list of strings using the `f'{string}'` syntax, which avoids the need for a separator when concatenating. It then joins these segments to create a single concatenated string. 

The output of this code is `acede`. 

Let me know if you would like me to explain any part of the code in more detail.
