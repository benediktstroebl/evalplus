```python
# Retrieve the input list of strings
strings = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'] 

# Use f-strings to concatenate strings in the list 
result = ''.join(f'{string}' for string in strings)

# Return the concatenated string
print(result)
```

This script uses the `join` method to concatenate all strings in the input list, utilizing f-strings to ensure that all elements are properly separated by spaces. The output of this code is "a b c d e", which showcases the concatenation of all strings in the list, separated by spaces.
