```python
# Markdown code block: Python script with a self-contained function
import typing       # Import the typing module

def concatenate(strings: typing.List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string.
    """
    result = ''
    for string in strings:
        result += string
    return result
```
This script includes the required import statement and defines the `concatenate` function to concatenate a list of strings into a single string. It is a self-contained Python script as it can be executed without relying on any external dependencies other than those included in the Python runtime environment. 
The function is documented with a docstring and the `typing` module is utilised to annotate the input parameter as a list of strings. This provides improved type checking and documentation when interacting with the function.
