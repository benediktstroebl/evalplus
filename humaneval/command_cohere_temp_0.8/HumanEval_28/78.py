```python
# Importing the necessary module
from typing import List

# The function to be defined and tested
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string.
    """
    result = ''
    for string in strings:
        result += string
    return result

# Sample tests
# Test empty list
test_cases = [([], '')]
# Test single-element list
test_cases.append((['a'], 'a'))
# Test multi-element list
test_cases.append((['a', 'b', 'c'], 'abc'))

# Checking the function against test cases
for idx, (test_input, expected) in enumerate(test_cases):
    output = concatenate(test_input)
    if output != expected:
        print(f"Test case {idx+1} failed - Input: {test_input}, Expected: {expected}, Actual: {output}")
```

In this script, a function called `concatenate` is defined, which takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string that concatenates all the elements of the list. The function is then tested against multiple test cases, and the correct output is verified for each case. Any discrepancy between the actual and expected outputs is reported as a failure.

The test cases are included as lists of inputs and expected outputs, with an additional empty list test case to ensure the function handles an empty input gracefully. You can add more test cases as needed to thoroughly validate the function's behavior.
