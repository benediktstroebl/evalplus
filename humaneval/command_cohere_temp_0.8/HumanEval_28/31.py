```python
# Solve the problem:
# Given a list of string, return a concatenated string

from typing import List

def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    """
    result = ''.join(strings)
    return result
```
The `concatenate` function takes a list of strings (`List[str]`) as an argument and uses the `join` method to concatenate the strings in the list into a single string. The resulting string is then returned. 

This function is encapsulated in a self-contained Python script, which can be used independently to solve the problem of concatenating a list of strings into a single string. 
The approach employs the principles of functional programming, using pure functions to transform data, leading to more efficient and readable code. 

This solution is also maintainable and scalable, as it handles various input scenarios gracefully without requiring explicit looping or conditional logic.
