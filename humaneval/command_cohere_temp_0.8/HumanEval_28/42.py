```python
# Import the necessary module
from typing import List


# Define the function
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string.
    """
    result = ''.join(strings)
    return result
```

This code provides an implementation of the `concatenate` function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string as output, achieving the goal described in the prompt.
