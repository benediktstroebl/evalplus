```python
# Retrieve the list of strings
strings = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'] 

# concatenate the strings in the list into a single string
res = ''.join(strings)

# print the result
print(res)
```
This script uses the `join` method to concatenate all the strings in the `strings` list into a single string, and prints the result. When you run this script, it will output: 
```
abcdef
```
