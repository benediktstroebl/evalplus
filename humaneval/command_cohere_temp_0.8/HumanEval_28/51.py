```python
# Importing the necessary module
from typing import List

# The function to be defined and solved
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string.
    """
    result = ''
    for string in strings:
        result += string
    return result

# Sample tests
# Empty list
test_list = []
result = concatenate(test_list)
assert result == ''

# Single string
test_list = ['abc']
result = concatenate(test_list)
assert result == 'abc'

# Multiple strings
test_list = ['ab', 'cd', 'ef']
result = concatenate(test_list)
assert result == 'abcdef'
```

This script defines a function called `concatenate` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string that concatenates all the elements in the list. It then conducts some basic tests to validate its functionality. The `assert` statements check that the function behaves as expected when an empty list and lists containing single and multiple strings are passed in.  This validates that the function performs the basic task of concatenating strings as outlined in your problem prompt.  The function is documented with a simple docstring for clarity.
