```python
# Retrieve the requested function definition and its docstring
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    >>> concatenate([])
    ''
    >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'abc'
    """
# Add the type hint for the function argument and the return type
from typing import List


def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string """
    result = ""
    for string in strings:
        result += string
    return result
```

The function `concatenate()` takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string that concatenates all the strings in the list. It is tested twice with empty input and with input equal to ['a', 'b', 'c'], and thus the function should return an empty string and 'abc' respectively. The type hint for the function argument and the return type is also added to ensure that the function is compatible with the typing module in Python. 

To ensure this, below is a test script that can be used to check if the function works as intended:
```python
# Test if the function concatenate() works as intended
def test_concatenate():
    # Empty list case
    assert concatenate([]) == ""

    # Non-empty list case
    assert concatenate(["a", "b", "c"]) == "abc"


if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_concatenate()
```

By running this code, you can check if the function behaves as expected. In this case, the test_concatenate() function runs the function twice with the aforementioned test cases, and the `assert` keywords check that the results are as expected.  If the function works as advertised, you should not see any exceptions or error messages when running this code.  Any of these occurrences would indicate that the function does not work as expected, and it would need to be reevaluated and possibly modified.  If this happens, you can modify the function in the code above to make it work as needed and rerun the test suite to verify the changes.  This would ensure that the function is correct and ready for use in other code as needed.
