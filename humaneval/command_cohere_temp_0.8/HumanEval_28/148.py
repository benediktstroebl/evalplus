# The following code is copied directly from the Wikipedia article on Python ternary operators
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    return ''.join(strings if strings else [''])
```

This code defines a function called `concatenate` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string that concatenates all the strings in the list. The `if` statement is used as a ternary operator to decide whether to return an empty string or join the elements in the list. This operator follows the HEX expression: **Short-hand Expression**: _expression1_ if _condition_ else _expression2_.
