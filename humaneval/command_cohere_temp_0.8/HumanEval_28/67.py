```python
# Importing the required module
from typing import List

# Defining the concatenate function
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string.
    """
    result = ''
    for string in strings:
        result += string
    return result

# Testing the concatenate function
def test_concatenate():
    """
    Test the concatenate function.
    """
    # Case 1: Empty list
    assert concatenate([]) == ''

    # Case 2: List of strings
    assert concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c']) == 'abc'

    # Case 3: List with different types
    assert concatenate(['a', '1', 'c']) == 'a1c'

# Running the tests
test_concatenate()
```

This code defines a function called `concatenate` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string containing the concatenated elements. It then includes a test function, `test_concatenate`, which uses the `assert` statement to verify the correctness of the `concatenate` function against three different cases. 

To run this code, you can either copy and paste it into a Python interpreter or save it in a file with a .py extension and execute it using the command line:
```
python <filename>.py
``` 

This will run the test_concatenate function and assert the expected results.  Any assertion would lead to the subsequent execution of the test case failing.  If you wish to display the test outcomes, you may also insert a `print` statement within the `test_concatenate()` function for more visibility.  This will provide you with a more detailed insight into the assertions' outcomes.
