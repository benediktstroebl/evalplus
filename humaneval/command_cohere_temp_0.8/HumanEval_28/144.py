```python
# Retrieve the requested function definition and its docstring
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    >>> concatenate([])
    ''
    >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'abc'
    """
# Add the type hint to the function signature
from typing import List

# Add the empty list argument to the function definition
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    if not strings:
        return ''
    return ''.join(strings)
``` 

This code defines a function `concatenate` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string as output. The function is designed to join all the strings in the input list together to form a concatenated string. It does this using the `join` method of string objects, which is implicitly called on an empty string `''` to ensure that any strings with whitespace or other characters are correctly concatenated. 

To use this function, you can assign it to a variable and call it with a list of strings to obtain the concatenated result, as demonstrated in the example below: 
```python
# Assign the function to a variable
my_concatenate = concatenate

# Create a sample list of strings
strings = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

# Call the function and store the result in a variable
result = my_concatenate(strings)

# Print the result
print(result)  # Output: 'applebananacherry'
``` 

In this example: 
- We assign the `concatenate` function to the variable `my_concatenate`. 
- We create a sample list of strings called `strings` that contains three elements: 'apple', 'banana', and 'cherry'. 
- We call the `my_concatenate` function with the `strings` list as an argument, and the result is stored in the `result` variable. 
- Finally, we print the `result` to display the concatenated output: 'applebananacherry'. 

This will result in a printed output of 'applebananacherry'. 
This demonstrates how the `concatenate` function can be used to join a list of strings into a single concatenated string, which is helpful when you need to combine multiple strings into a unified representation.
