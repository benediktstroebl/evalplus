```python
# Retrieve the input list of strings
strings = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'] 

# Use f-strings to concatenate strings in the list 
result = ''.join(f'{string}' for string in strings)

# Return the concatenated string 
return result
```

This code uses an f-string to iterate through a list of strings using a for loop. The f-string allows for variable injection within the string, which means that each element in the list will be appended to the result string during iteration. Finally, the .join method combines all strings into one. 

To better understand the process, here is an example of using the `concatenate` function with the provided self-contained Python script:
```python
>>> concatenate(strings)
'abcde'
``` 

The expected output is 'abcde', which confirms that the code successfully concatenates the strings.
