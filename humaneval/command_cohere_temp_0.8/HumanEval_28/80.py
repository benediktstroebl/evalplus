```python
# Importing the necessary module
from typing import List


# Defining a function to concatenate a list of strings into a single string
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    concatenated = ''.join(strings)
    return concatenated
```

This code defines a function called `concatenate` that takes a list of strings (`List[str]`) as input and returns a single string that concatenates all the strings in the list. It uses the `typing` module to define the input parameter as a list of strings and the return value as a string. 

To concatenate the strings in the list, it uses the `join()` method to join the strings together into a single string, and then returns this concatenated string. 

The function is designed to be self-contained, meaning it does not depend on any external variables or contexts. It efficiently composes strings together, resulting in a straightforward solution for the specified problem.
