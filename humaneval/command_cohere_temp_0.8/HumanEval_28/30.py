```python
# Importing the necessary module
from typing import List

# The function to be defined and tested
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string.
    """
    result = ''
    for string in strings:
        result += string
    return result

# Test cases
def test_concatenate():
    """
    Test cases for the concatenate function.
    """
    # Empty list
    assert concatenate([]) == ''

    # List with elements
    assert concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c']) == 'abc'

    # List with special characters
    assert concatenate(['!!!', '???', '??????']) == '!!!?????????'

# Running the tests
test_concatenate()
```

Let's break down the code step by step:
1. The code includes a type hinting declaration, stating that the `concatenate` function will accept a list of strings (`List[str]`) and return a string (`str`).
2. Three example cases are provided directly within the function, demonstrating how the `concatenate` function operates. Each example showcases a distinct scenario: an empty list (`[]`), a list with three plain characters (`['a', 'b', 'c']`), and a list containing special characters (`['!!!', '???', '??????']`).
3. The `test_concatenate()` function is devised to rigorously assess the capabilities of the `concatenate` function. It comprises two assertions.  
4. The first assertion tests the function's behavior when an empty list is passed in. It asserts that the result of concatenating an empty list should be an empty string (`''`).
5. The second assertion examines the result of concatenating a non-empty list, expecting it to concatenate the string elements in the order they appear in the list (`'abc'`).
6. The final step executes the `test_concatenate()` function, ensuring the `concatenate` function operates as expected.

By running this code, you can validate the `concatenate` function's correctness against these specific cases. You may expand this test suite by adding more assertions to cover a broader range of scenarios and edge cases, enhancing the function's robustness.
