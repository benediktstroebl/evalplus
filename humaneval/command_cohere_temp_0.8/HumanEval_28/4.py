```python
# Importing the required module
from typing import List


# Defining the function
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string.
    """
    # If the input list is empty, returning an empty string
    if not strings:
        return ''

    # Using join() to concatenate the strings in the list with a space separator
    return ' '.join(strings)

```

This Python script defines a function called `concatenate` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string that contains the concatenation of all the input strings. The function handles the edge case where the input list is empty by returning an empty string. 

To use this function in your code, you can import it from the file in which it is defined.
