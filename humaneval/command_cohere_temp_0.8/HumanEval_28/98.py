```python
# Retrieve the description of the problem and the test cases
from typing import List

def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    >>> concatenate([])
    ''
    >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'abc'
    """
    concatenated_strings = ''.join(strings)
    return concatenated_strings
```

This code defines a function called `concatenate` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string that concatenates all the input strings together. The function uses the `join` method to join the strings in the list with a blank space between them, and returns the resulting single string.

The function is tested twice: first, an empty list is passed, and the function returns an empty string; second, a list including the strings 'a', 'b', and 'c' is passed, and the function returns 'abc'. These tests ensure that the function correctly concatenates strings, and is robust against empty input. 

The description of the problem and the tests are embedded in the code as docstrings, which are useful for documenting code and providing examples to users who may need to understand or modify the code in the future.  This makes the code follows the best practice of including documentation in code, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain the code.  By including the tests within the code, the code is also easier to distribute and reuse, since it is self-contained.
