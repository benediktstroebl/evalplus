```python
# Importing the necessary module
from typing import List


# Defining the function to concatenate the strings in the list
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    >>> concatenate([])
    ''
    >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'abc'
    """
    concatenated = ''.join(strings)
    return concatenated
```

This Python script defines a function called `concatenate` that takes a list of strings (`List[str]`) as input and returns a single string that concatenates all the strings in the list. The function uses the `join` method to join the strings in the list with a blank space as the separator.

The `concatenate` function is designed to handle an empty list gracefully and avoid any potential errors. It returns an empty string if the input list is empty. This is aligned with the problem statement and also ensures that the function handles all possible inputs gracefully. 

The script includes example usages of the `concatenate` function with the `>>>` prompt, which evaluates the function with the provided test cases and prints the results. These example tests confirm that the function correctly handles an empty list and a list with three strings. 

Overall, the Python script provides an efficient and scalable solution to the problem, ensuring the function can handle various inputs and scenarios without performance issues as the list size increases.
