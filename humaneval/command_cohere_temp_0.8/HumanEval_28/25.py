```python
# Import the necessary module
from typing import List

# Declare the function
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string.
    """
    # Check if the input list is empty
    if not strings:
        return ""
    
    # Use concatenation and str() to convert to string
    # Using f-strings for clearer formatting
    return "".join(str(string) for string in strings)

# Example usage
# Test with an empty list
print(concatenate([]))  # Expected output: ''

# Test with a list of strings
print(concatenate(["a", "b", "c"]))  # Expected output: 'abc'
```

This script defines a function called `concatenate`, which takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string as output. The function checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns an empty string. If the list is not empty, it uses the `join` method to concatenate the strings in the list into a single string and returns the result. 

The example usage and tests demonstrate how to use the `concatenate` function with different input scenarios. In the comments, I have also included the expected outputs for these tests. Let me know if you have any questions or if you would like further improvements or additional features.
