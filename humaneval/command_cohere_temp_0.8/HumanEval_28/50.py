```python
# Importing required module
from typing import List


# Defining function
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    >>> concatenate([])
    ''
    >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'abc'
    """
    concatenated = ''.join(strings)
    return concatenated
```

This script defines a function called `concatenate` that takes a list of strings (`List[str]`) as input and returns a single string that concatenates all the input strings together. The function uses the `join` method to join the elements of the list together into a single string, and returns it.

The `join` method joins all items in an iterable into a single string, with an optional separator between each item. The output is then returned as the result. 

This function is designed to be self-contained, meaning it can be run directly from the script and doesn't rely on any external variables or functions. 

When empty list is provided as an argument, the function returns an empty string. When a list of strings is provided, the function concatenates them in the order they appear in the list. 

This solution can be used to consolidate any list of strings into a single string, whenever it is required in any program. 

Overall, the function is both self-contained and solves the problem in a simple and efficient way.
