```python
# Import the necessary module
from typing import List


# Define the function
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string.
    """
    result = ''
    for string in strings:
        result += string
    return result


# Provide example tests
# Necessary because function is determined to be "too" simple
# to require example tests
# (i.e., this would be redundant)
"""
>>> concatenate([])
''
>>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
'abc'
"""
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `concatenate` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string that concatenates all the input strings together. The function is designed to handle an empty list gracefully and simply append the strings in the list if they are not empty.

The function is straightforward, taking the list of strings as input and using a for loop to iterate over each string, adding it to a running total. The returned result is the combined string. 

The example tests show two scenarios, testing both an empty list as well as a list with three strings, showing the function works as expected. 
This approach provides a simple and effective solution to the problem, ensuring the functionality remains clear and easy to understand. Gaining clarity on the solution approach is always beneficial when solving coding problems, especially if they are relatively straightforward such as this one, as it helps foster efficient and elegant solutions.
