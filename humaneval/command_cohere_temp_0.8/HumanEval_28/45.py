```python
# Retrieve the requested function definition and its docstring
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    >>> concatenate([])
    ''
    >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'abc'
    """
# Reinstate the function definition with improved type hints
from typing import List

def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    if not strings:
        return ""
    return "".join(strings)
# Add the 'List[str]' annotation to the function definition
```

This script defines a function `concatenate` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string as output. The function first checks if the input list is empty, and if so, it returns an empty string. Otherwise, it joins the strings in the list together into a single string and returns the concatenated result.

The behavior is exemplified in the docstring through example tests, illustrating how the function behaves when provided with an empty list versus a list with three elements. These example tests help clarify the function's expected input and its corresponding output.

This improved version ensures consistency between the function definition and its corresponding annotation, allowing for more accurate type hinting during usage.
