```python
# Retrieve the input list of strings
function concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty string to store the final concatenated string
    concatenated = ""
    # Iterate through the list and concatenate strings
    for string in strings:
        concatenated += string
    # Return the concatenated string
    return concatenated

# Test the function with examples
assert concatenate([]) == ""
assert concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c']) == 'abc'
``` 

This code provides a Python function called `concatenate` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string that concatenates all the elements in the order they appear in the list. The function is tested against two examples, and the tests confirm its correctness.
