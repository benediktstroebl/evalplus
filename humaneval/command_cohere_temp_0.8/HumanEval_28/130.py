```python
# Importing required module
from typing import List


# Defining the function
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string.
    """
    result = ''
    for string in strings:
        result += string
    return result


# Sample tests
# Test empty list
test_cases = [([], '')]

# Test list with elements
test_cases.append((['a', 'b', 'c'], 'abc'))

# Testing function with test-cases
for input, expected in test_cases:
    output = concatenate(input)
    assert output == expected, f"For input {input}, expected {expected} but got {output}"
```

The test cases are designed to validate the functionality of the `concatenate` function with various inputs, ensuring it behaves as expected. In the script, a list of test cases is defined where each element is a tuple containing the input list of strings and the expected concatenated string. The `assert` statement checks if the output of the `concatenate` function matches the expected result for each test case. If the assertion passes, it indicates successful matching of the output with the expected value. Otherwise, an error is raised, providing an informative message that specifies the input and expected values for easier debugging. 

Let me know if you would like me to make any modifications to the code.
