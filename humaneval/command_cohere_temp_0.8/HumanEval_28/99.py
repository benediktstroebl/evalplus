```python
# Retrieve the input list of strings
strings = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'] 

# Use f-strings to concatenate strings in the list 
result = ''.join(f'{string}' for string in strings)

# Return the concatenated string
print(result)
```
This code solves the problem by using `f-strings` to concatenate strings in the input list, ensuring that empty strings are not skipped in the concatenation process. The result is a single string that combines all the elements of the list, including empty strings, without any unnecessary whitespace or separators.
