```python
# Markdown code block
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string.
    """
    result = ''.join(strings)
    return result
```

This Python script defines a function `concatenate` that takes a list of strings as input and uses the `join` method to concatenate them into a single string. The `join` method iterates over the list and inserts a delimiter between each element, which is an empty string in this case, resulting in a single string that concatenates all the inputs. The function returns this concatenated string. 

The function's docstring includes example usage that demonstrates how the function behaves for the edge case of an empty list and a non-empty list, providing clarity and guidance to users who may want to understand or utilize the function in their code.
