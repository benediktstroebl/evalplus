```python
# Retrieve the defined function
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    >>> concatenate([])
    ''
    >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'abc'
    """
    result = ''
    for string in strings:
        result += string
    return result
```
The `concatenate` function takes a list of strings (`List[str]`) as an argument and returns a single string that concatenates all the strings in the list. It initially creates an empty string called `result`, and then it iterates over each string in the input list and appends each string to the `result` variable. Finally, it returns the `result` string. 

The `typing` module is imported to enable type hints, designating the expected input type of the `strings` parameter as a list of strings (`List[str]`). Type hints are optional in Python, but they are a beneficial practice as they help to increase code readability, provide clarity on the expected inputs, and enable successful runtime type checking when using the `typeguard` module. 

This solution's docstring includes concise descriptions of the function's goals, inputs, and outputs, as well as informative example usage snippets that demonstrate its functionality. These examples, which are commonly referred to as unit tests, verify the function's correctness by using various input scenarios. When questioned, these tests should yield the following anticipated results:
```
```python
>>> concatenate([])
''
>>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
'abc'
```
```
These tests verify the function's behavior against two distinct cases: an empty list of strings and a list of three strings. The expected output for the first case is an empty string, while the expected output for the second case is the concatenated string 'abc'. If the function operates properly, the output should correspond to the docstring examples.
