from typing import List


# Defining function
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    >>> concatenate([])
    ''
    >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'abc'
    """
    # If the input list is empty, returning an empty string
    if not strings:
        return ''
    # Returning concatenated string by joining strings in the list with a space
    return ' '.join(strings)
```

This Python script defines a function called `concatenate` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string. The function first checks if the input list is empty, and if so, returns an empty string. Otherwise, it joins the strings in the list together with a space between them and returns the concatenated string. This is done using the `join` method which takes an iterable of strings as input and returns a single string with all the strings concatenated. 

The `join` method also accepts an optional separator, which is added between the strings. In this case, it uses a space as the separator (as indicated by the ' ' in `return ' '.join(strings)`).

This problem can also be solved without using the `join` method, by iterating through the list and concatenating strings together with a separator. 
Here's an example of such implementation: 
 ```python
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    if not strings:
        return ''
    result = []
    for string in strings:
        result.append(string)
    return ''.join(result)
``` 

In this version, the list strings are iterated using a for loop. Each element is appended to a new list called result. Then ''.join(result) joins the list of strings from the result list into a single string. 

Both implementations have the same time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list. This is because both implementations have to iterate through the list at least once. 

Please note that my response here is basis the aforementioned clarification.  feel free to adapt this implementation to your needs. Let me know if you would like anything else!
