```python
# Retrieve the input list of strings
function concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty string to store the final concatenated string
    concatenated = ""
    # Iterate through the list of strings and concatenate them to the final string
    for string in strings:
        concatenated += string
    # Return the final concatenated string
    return concatenated

# Test the function with an empty list of strings
>>> concatenate([])
''

# Test the function with a list of strings
>>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
'abc'
```

In the above code, the `concatenate()` function takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the list. The function initializes an empty string, `concatenated`, to store the final concatenated result. It then iterates through the list of strings and concatenates each string to the `concatenated` string using the `+=` operator. Finally, the function returns the `concatenated` string.

The function is tested twice. The first test uses an empty list of strings, and the second test uses a list of three strings. In both cases, the function returns the expected output.
