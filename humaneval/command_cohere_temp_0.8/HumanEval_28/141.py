```python
# Importing required module
from typing import List


# Defining the function
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string.
    """
    result = ''
    for string in strings:
        result += string
    return result


# Sample tests
# Test empty list
test_cases = [([], '')]

# Test single element
test_cases.append((['a'], 'a'))

# Test multiple elements
test_cases.append((['a', 'b', 'c'], 'abc'))

# Checking the function against all test cases
for test_case in test_cases:
    strings = test_case[0]
    expected_result = test_case[1]
    actual_result = concatenate(strings)
    if actual_result != expected_result:
        raise ValueError(f"For the input {strings}, Expected {expected_result} but got {actual_result}")
```

The test cases cover different scenarios, including an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with multiple elements. The function performs string concatenation as stated in the problem description. Feel free to modify the script to test other cases or enhance the function further according to your needs. 
If you would like to have the tests encapsulated within the function for additional assurance, I can modify the code to include `unittest` module.
