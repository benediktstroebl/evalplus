```python
# Solve the problem:
# Given a list of strings, return a string that is the concatenation of all strings in the list, 

from typing import List

def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    return ''.join(strings)
```

The Python script defines a function `concatenate` that takes a list of strings (`List[str]`) as an argument and returns a concatenated string of all the inputs. It uses the `join` method to concatenate the strings and returns the result as a single string. 

This function is self-contained and can be used to concatenate a list of strings into a single string. 

To demonstrate the functionality, examples cited in the problem statement can be added as unit tests:
```python
# Test cases:
def test_concatenate_empty_list():
    result = concatenate([])
    assert result == ''

def test_concatenate_three_strings():
    result = concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    assert result == 'abc'
``` 

To run the tests, you can add the following code to the script and execute the file:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__" :
    unittest.main()
``` 

This will run the tests and report any results, ensuring that the `concatenate` function behaves as expected.
