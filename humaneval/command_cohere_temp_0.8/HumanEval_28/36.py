```python
# Import the necessary module
from typing import List

# Declare the function
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string.
    """
    # Check if the input list is empty
    if not strings:
        return ''
    
    # Use a join() method to concatenate strings in the list
    return ''.join(strings)

# Provide example tests that can be executed to validate the function
example_tests = [
    ('empty list', [], ''),
    ('list with items', ['a', 'b', 'c'], 'abc')
]

# Iterate through tests
for title, input, result in example_tests:
    print(f"Test: {title}")
    print(f"Input: {input}")
    print(f"Expected: {result}")
    print(f"Actual: {concatenate(input)}")
    print("=" * 30)
```

The `concatenate()` function takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string as output. It checks if the input list is empty; if so, it returns an empty string. If the list contains one or more strings, it uses the `join()` method to concatenate the strings into a single string, separating them with the character specified in the method (by default, a whitespace character `' '`). 

The example tests aim to validate the `concatenate()` function. They are designed to demonstrate how the function behaves with different inputs, and the expected results are compared to the actual outputs. 

You can execute this code to see the test results. To make the testing process more streamlined, you may consider using an testing framework such as `unittest` in combination with the `assert` statement to encapsulate and organize your tests and enforce clear and readable assertions. 

This approach helps ensure the function works correctly in different scenarios.
