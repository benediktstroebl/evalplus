from typing import List

def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string.

    return result
```

This code snippet provides an improved version of the given problem. The `concatenate()` function takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string. It achieves this by iterating over each string in the list and appending it to the `result` variable. The final value of `result` is then returned.

This approach ensures simplicity and efficiency. It avoids the use of any additional variables or complex operations, achieving a linear time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list.
