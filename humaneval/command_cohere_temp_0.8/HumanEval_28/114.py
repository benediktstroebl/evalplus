```python
# Retrieve the input list of strings
strings = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'] 

# Define the function
def concatenate(input_list: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    This function takes in a list of strings and concatenates them into a single string, 
    separating each string with an empty space, and ignoring empty strings within the list. 
    Returns an empty string if the input list is empty.
    
    Args:
        input_list (list): A list of strings to be concatenated
    
    Returns:
        str: A single concatenated string representing all strings in the input list
    """
    # Initialize an empty string to store the final concatenated string
    concatenated = ""
    # Iterate through the list and append each string to the concatenated string
    for string in input_list:
        if string: 
            concatenated += f"{string} " 
    # Remove trailing space
    return concatenated.rstrip(' ')

# Test the function with the input list provided and expected output
print(f'\nResult:\n{concatenate(strings)}')
```

To test the function, I have added a sample input list of strings (`['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']`) and printed the result of the function call, which should produce the following output:
```binedit
Result:
a b c d e 
```

This script solves the problem of concatenating a list of strings into a single string, while also adding an empty space between each string and ignoring any empty strings in the list. Let me know if you would like me to explain any part of the code in more detail.
