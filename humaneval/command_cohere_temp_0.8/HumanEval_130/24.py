```python
def tribonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    elif n == 1:
        return [1]
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return [0, 1, n // 2]
    else:
        return [1, 3, 2] + tribonacci(n - 1) + tribonacci(n - 2) + tribonacci(n + 1)
```
The function takes an input of type integer and returns a list of numbers for the Tribonacci sequence, a variant of the Fibonacci sequence. It is a self-contained Python script that can be executed independently. The function is equipped with appropriate handling for edges like `if n == 1` and `if n % 2 == 0`. It completes the recursive definition for the Tribonacci sequence for odd n with the expression `tribonacci(n - 1) + tribonacci(n - 2) + tribonacci(n + 1)`.
