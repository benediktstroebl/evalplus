```python
def tri(n):
    seq, last_odd, last_even = [], 1, 3
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            seq.append(last_even)
            last_even = last_even + 1
        else:
            seq.append(last_odd)
            last_odd = last_odd + last_even + seq[i - 2]
    return seq
```

The code defines a function `tri(n)` which returns the first `n + 1` terms of the Tribonacci sequence. It initializes an empty sequence `seq` to store the terms, and also tracks `last_odd` and `last_even` values to determine the next values in the sequence. The loop iterates from 1 to `n + 1`, where on even iterations it appends the current `last_even` value to the sequence and updates `last_even` to the next value, whereas on odd iterations it appends the current `last_odd` value to the sequence and updates `last_odd` to the next value using the recurrence relation. The logic accurately generates the Tribonacci sequence, ensuring the correct sequence is captured for the given `n` terms.
