```python
def tribonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    elif n == 1:
        return [1]
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return [0] + tribonacci(n - 1)
    else:
        return [1] + tribonacci(n - 1) + tribonacci(n - 2) + tribonacci(n + 1)
```

The function takes an integer n as input and returns a list of the first n + 1 numbers in the Tribonacci sequence. It checks if `n` is equal to 0, returns `[0]`, and if `n` is equal to 1, it returns `[1]`. For even `n`, the function returns `[0] + tribonacci(n - 1)`, meaning it adds a 0 at the beginning of the list of the Tribonacci sequence for n-1. For odd `n`, it returns `[1] + tribonacci(n - 1) + tribonacci(n - 2) + tribonacci(n + 1)`, adding the first element of the sequence to the list of previous two elements of the Tribonacci sequence for n-1 and n-2 and the Tribonacci sequence for n + 1.

Here's a brief explanation of the logic behind the Tribonacci sequence, which is different from the well-known Fibonacci sequence:
1. Tribonacci(1) = 1 (This is the initial condition).
2. Tribonacci(2) = 1 (Recall the initial condition).
3. Tribonacci(3) = 1 + 2 = 3 (Apply the recurrence relation).
4. Tribonacci(4) = Tribonacci(3) + Tribonacci(2) + Tribonacci(1) + Tribonacci(5) = 3 + 1 + 1 + 0 + Tribonacci(5) = 4 + Tribonacci(5).
5. Tribonacci(5) = Tribonacci(4) + Tribonacci(3) + Tribonacci(2) + Tribonacci(1) + Tribonacci(6) = 4 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 0 + Tribonacci(6) = 5 + Tribonacci(6).
6. And so on. The pattern continues with the next element being the sum of the previous three elements in the sequence, with the last position in the sum always being the next position in the sequence. 
It's important to note that unlike the Fibonacci sequence, where each subsequent element is the sum of the previous two, the Tribonacci sequence adds the previous three elements to get the next element.
