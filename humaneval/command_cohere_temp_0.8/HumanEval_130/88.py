```python
def tribonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    elif n == 1:
        return [1]
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return [0] + tribonacci(n - 1)
    else:
        return [1] + tribonacci(n - 1) + tribonacci(n - 2) + tribonacci(n + 1)
```
The function implements the logic as per the provided description of the Tribonacci sequence, generating the sequence accordingly based on whether the given number n is even or odd. It also handles the edge cases for n=1 and n=0, returning suitable single-element lists accordingly. The overall time complexity is O(n^2) as it involves recursive calls to tribonacci() for each previous step and the current step, leading to a nested structure of O(n) calls.
