```python
def tribonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    elif n == 1:
        return [1]
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return [0, 1, n // 2]
    else:
        return [1, 3, 2] + tribonacci(n - 1) + tribonacci(n - 2) + tribonacci(n + 1)
```
The function takes an input of type integer, and returns a list of the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence, using the definition of the Tribonacci sequence as mentioned in the problem statement. This definition is based on the Fibonacci sequence but has different recurrence relations for odd and even indices. A detailed explanation of how the code works is provided below:
1. The code starts with a base case test, `if n == 0`, which returns `[0]` which sets the base of the sequence and the next value will be derived from this one, which aligns with the definition of the Tribonacci sequence.
2. Then, there is another base case test, `if n == 1`, that returns `[1]` because according to the definition of the Tribonacci sequence, `tri(1) = 3`.
3. The next test, `elif n % 2 == 0`, checks if the number is even, and if it is, it returns `[0, 1, n // 2]` following the definition that states `tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even`.
4. If the above conditions are not met, meaning that n is odd, it means that it is a timing to apply the recurrence relation `tri(n) = tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1)`, so the function returns `[1, 3, 2] + tribonacci(n - 1) + tribonacci(n - 2) + tribonacci(n + 1)`. Note that in the returned value, `[1, 3, 2]` are the first 3 terms of the Tribonacci sequence for this odd number, and the rest is added using the recurrence relation as subtraction from the previous terms of the same sequence.
