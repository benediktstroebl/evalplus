```python
def tri(n):
    result = [0, 1, 3]
    while len(result) < n + 1:
        if len(result) % 2 == 0:
            result.append(1 + result[-1] / 2)
        else:
            x = result[-1]
            y = result[-2]
            z = result[-3]
            result.append(x + y + z)
    return result[:n+1]
``` 

This code defines a Python function called `tri(n)` that generates the first `n+1` terms of the Tribonacci sequence. The Tribonacci sequence is an extension of the Fibonacci sequence where each term is the sum of the previous three terms. The function starts with an initial list of the first three terms of the Tribonacci sequence (`[0, 1, 3]`). It then enters a loop that continues until the length of the `result` list is greater than `n`. Within the loop, it checks whether the length of the `result` list is even or odd to determine the next step. If the length is even, it calculates the next term as `1 + result[-1] / 2`, which follows the definition of the Tribonacci sequence. If the length is odd, it calculates the next term as the sum of the last three terms in the sequence (`result[-1] + result[-2] + result[-3]`). After updating the result, it appends the new term to the `result` list. Finally, the function returns the first `n+1` terms of the Tribonacci sequence.
