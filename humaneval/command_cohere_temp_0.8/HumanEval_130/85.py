```python
def tribonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    elif n == 1:
        return [1]
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return [0] + tribonacci(n - 1)
    else:
        return [1] + tribonacci(n - 1) + tribonacci(n - 2) + tribonacci(n + 1)
```
The function implements the Tribonacci sequence: 

1. `n == 0`: Returns `[0]`, as the first number in the Tribonacci sequence is 0.
2. `n == 1`: Returns `[1]`, as the second number in the Tribonacci sequence is 1.
3. `n % 2 == 0`: For even-valued `n`, it returns `[0] + tribonacci(n - 1)`, where `[0]` represents the current term of the sequence (the 0th index), and `tribonacci(n - 1)` represents the previous terms of the sequence (the 1st index up to `n - 1` index).
4. `n % 2 != 0`: For odd-valued `n`, it returns `[1] + tribonacci(n - 1) + tribonacci(n - 2) + tribonacci(n + 1)`, where `[1]` represents the current term of the sequence (the 0th index), and `tribonacci(n - 1)` represents the previous terms of the sequence (the 1st index up to `n - 1` index), and `tribonacci(n - 2)` and `tribonacci(n + 1)` represent the terms before and after the current term. 

This approach ensures that the function provides the correct terms of the Tribonacci sequence for the specified `n`.
