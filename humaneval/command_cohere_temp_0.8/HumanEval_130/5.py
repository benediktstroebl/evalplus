```python
def tri(n):
    seq, last_odd, last_even = [], 1, 3
    for i in range(n+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            seq.append(last_even)
            last_even = 1 + i / 2
        else:
            seq.append(last_odd)
            last_odd = seq[i - 1] + seq[i - 2] + last_even
    return seq
```
The provided code defines a Python function called 'tri(n)' that generates the first 'n+1' terms of the Tribonacci sequence, which is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence but with different recurrence relations for even and odd indices.

The function initializes an empty list 'seq' to store the sequence and assigns the first two values of the sequence to 'last_odd' and 'last_even', respectively. It then iterates through the range of 'n' to 'n+1,' where 'n' is the input number.

During the iteration, the function checks whether the index 'i' is even or odd. If 'i' is even, it calculates the next value as '1 + i/2' and appends it to both 'seq' and 'last_even.' If 'i' is odd, it calculates the next value as the sum of the previous three values in the sequence and appends it to both 'seq' and 'last_odd.' This process continues for 'n+1' indices, and the function returns the completed sequence.
