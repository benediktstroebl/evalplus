```python
def tribonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    elif n == 1:
        return [1]
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return [0] + tribonacci(n - 1)
    else:
        return [1] + tribonacci(n - 1) + tribonacci(n - 2) + tribonacci(n + 1)
```

The function implements the Tribonacci sequence based on the provided definition. It uses basic control flow to determine if the next value should be calculated based on the even or odd nature of the current `n` value. Further, it uses a recursive approach to calculate the sequence, building upon previously calculated values `tribonacci(n-1)` and `tribonacci(n-2)`. To handle the edge cases of `n=1` and `n=0`, it returns predefined lists to cater for the initial values of the sequence. I hope this assists you in solving this problem.
