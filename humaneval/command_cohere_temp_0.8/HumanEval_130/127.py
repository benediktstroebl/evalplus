```python
def tri(n):
    seq, last_odd, last_even = [], 1, 3
    while len(seq) < n + 1:
        if len(seq) % 2 == 0:
            seq.append(last_even)
            last_even = last_even + last_odd + seq[-1]
        else:
            seq.append(seq[-1] + seq[-2] + last_odd)
            last_odd = seq[-1]
    return seq[:n+1]
```

The problem discusses the Tribonacci sequence which is nearly identical to the Fibonacci sequence with the exception of the recurrence relationship for odd indices. This code defines a `tri` function that calculates the first `n+1` indices of the Tribonacci sequence, and returns it as a list. It uses two variables `last_even` and `last_odd` to keep track of the last even and odd indices computed respectively. The main loop runs until it has computed `n+1` indices, and uses a conditional to decide whether it should update `last_even` or `last_odd` and compute the next value in the sequence using the correct recurrence relationship. The output is a list of the first `n` indices of the Tribonacci sequence.
