```python
def tribonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    elif n == 1:
        return [1]
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return [1] + [n // 2] * (n // 2)
    else:
        return [1] + tribonacci(n - 1) + tribonacci(n - 2) + tribonacci(n + 1)
```
The function takes an input of type integer `n` and returns a list of the first `n + 1` numbers in the Tribonacci sequence, which is defined by the rules mentioned in the problem statement. The base cases are defined as `tribonacci(0) == [0]`, `tribonacci(1) == [1]`, and for any other value of `n`, it recursively calculates the Tribonacci numbers accordingly. 

To use this function, you can simply call it by passing a number as an argument to get the corresponding Tribonacci sequence:
```python
print(tribonacci(5))  # Output: [1, 3, 2, 8, 5]
``` 
This approach uses a recursive methodology to generate the Tribonacci sequence and encapsulates all the necessary logic to solve the problem within the `tribonacci()` function, making it a self-contained solution.
