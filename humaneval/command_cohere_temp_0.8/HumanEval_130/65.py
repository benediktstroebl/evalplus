```python
def tribonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    elif n == 1:
        return [1]
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return [1] + [n//2] + tribonacci(n - 2)
    else:
        return [1] + tribonacci(n - 1) + tribonacci(n - 2) + tribonacci(n + 1)
```

The function approaches the problem by breaking it down into three cases:
1. `n == 0`: This returns `[0]` since the Tribonacci sequence starts with 0. 
2. `n == 1`: This returns `[1]` since the Tribonacci sequence starts with 1.
3. `n > 1`: This is where the recursive magic happens, where the function will 
   - Check if `n` is even, in which case it will return `[1] + [n//2] + tribonacci(n - 2)`
   - Or if `n` is odd, in which case it will return `[1] + tribonacci(n - 1) + tribonacci(n - 2) + tribonacci(n + 1)`

This approach eliminates the need for an overly long recursive solution. It leverages the fact that the Tribonacci sequence is inherently simpler than the Fibonacci sequence. 

The function is modeled similarly to how one might compute the Fibonacci sequence in recursive fashion, but with the addition of the second recursive call to handle the odd `n` case. 

The unit tests would look like a list of test cases, where the input is a list of integers and the expected output is a list of integers corresponding to the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence. 

For example:
```python
def test_tribonacci():
    assert tribonacci(1) == [1]
    assert tribonacci(2) == [1, 3, 2]
    assert tribonacci(5) == [1, 3, 2, 8, 5, 13, 4, 11, 7]
``` 

This is just one way to approach this problem. There are many ways to solve this problem, and other approaches may be more efficient.
