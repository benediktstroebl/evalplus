```python
def tri(n):
    seq, last_odd, last_even = [], 1, 3
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            seq.append(last_even)
            last_even = 1 + i / 2
        else:
            seq.append(last_odd)
            last_odd = seq[i - 1] + seq[i - 2] + last_even
    return seq
``` 

This code defines a function called `tri(n)` that calculates the first `n + 1` terms of the Tribonacci sequence, which is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence but with different recurrence relations for odd and even indices. 

The function creates an empty list called `seq` to store the Tribonacci sequence and initializes two variables, `last_odd` and `last_even`, with the initial values for the odd and even indices, respectively. It then iterates through the range of indices from 1 to `n`, and for each index, it checks if the index is even or odd. 

If the index is even, it calculates the Tribonacci number for that index by adding 1 to the previous even-indexed Tribonacci number, which is stored in `last_even`. If the index is odd, it calculates the Tribonacci number by adding the three previous Tribonacci numbers for the current index, `seq[i - 1]`, `seq[i - 2]`, and `last_even`, and stores it in `last_odd`. In both cases, the calculated Tribonacci number is appended to the `seq` list. 

Finally, the function returns the `seq` list containing the first `n + 1` terms of the Tribonacci sequence.
