```python
def tri(n):
    seq, last_odd, last_even = [], 1, 3
    while len(seq) < n + 1:
        if len(seq) % 2 == 0:
            seq.append(last_even)
            last_even = last_even + last_odd + seq[-1]
        else:
            seq.append(last_odd)
            last_odd = last_odd + seq[-1] + last_even
    return seq[:n+1]
``` 

This Python script defines a function called `tri(n)` that generates the first `n+1` terms of the Tribonacci sequence, which is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence but with different recurrence relations for odd and even indices. Here's a summary of how it works:
1. To create the Tribonacci sequence, the algorithm utilizes two variables, `last_odd` and `last_even`, to keep track of the odd and even terms of the sequence, respectively.
2. The `while` loop continues to generate the sequence until the length of the sequence (`len(seq)`) reaches `n + 1`. This ensures that the function returns the correct number of terms.
3. Inside the loop, it checks whether the index is even or odd to determine which term to append to the sequence and update the corresponding variables.
   - If the index is even, it appends the value of `last_even` to the sequence. Then, it updates `last_even` by adding the previous odd term (`last_odd`), the current even term (`seq[-1]`), and the next odd term (`last_odd + seq[-1] + last_even`).
   - If the index is odd, it appends the value of `last_odd` to the sequence. It then updates `last_odd` by adding the previous two odd terms (`last_odd` and `seq[-1]`).

Finally, the function returns the first `n+1` terms of the Tribonacci sequence, which are stored in the `seq` list, to satisfy the problem statement.
