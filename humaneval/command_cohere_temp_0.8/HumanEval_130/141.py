```python
def tri(n):
    seq, last_odd, last_even = [], 1, 3
    while len(seq) < n + 1:
        if len(seq) % 2 == 0:
            seq.append(last_even)
            last_even = 1 + last_even // 2
        else:
            seq.append(sum(seq[-2:]))
            last_odd = last_odd + last_even + seq[-1]
    return seq[:n+1]
``` 

The problem asks us to generate the first `n + 1` numbers in the Tribonacci sequence, which is defined as follows:
- `tri(1) = 3`
- `tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even`
- `tri(n) = tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd`

We use two "buckets" to hold the even and odd Tribonacci numbers, with even bucket initialized to `1 + 1/2` and odd bucket initialized to `3`. Then we have a generator clause that iterates until it has generated `n + 1` numbers in the sequence, at which point it exits. 

On each iteration, it checks whether the current number should be even or odd:
- If the sequence's length is even, it appends the even bucket value to the sequence and updates the even bucket to the next Tribonacci number (`1 + 1/2`).
- Otherwise, it calculates the next odd Tribonacci number by summing the last odd, even, and previous odd Tribonacci numbers and appends it to the sequence. It then updates the last odd bucket to this value. 

Finally, the solution returns the first `n + 1` numbers in the Tribonacci sequence.
