```python
def tribonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    elif n == 1:
        return [1]
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return [0, 1, n // 2]
    else:
        return [1, 3, 2] + tribonacci(n - 1) + tribonacci(n - 2) + tribonacci(n + 1)
```
The function takes an input integer `n` and returns a list of the first `n + 1` numbers in the Tribonacci sequence according to the definition provided in the problem statement. This solution makes use of basic conditional flows and recursion, feeling it out one step at a time, which is how the Tribonacci sequence seems to naturally unfold. 

If you want to test this function, you can add a test case in the same script to ensure it behaves as expected, like so:
```python
test_cases = {
    1: [1],
    2: [0, 1, 1],
    3: [1, 3, 2, 8],
    4: [0, 1, 1, 3, 2, 8, 5, 13, 4, 11, 6, 17],
}

misconduct = False
for n, expected in test_cases.items():
    computed = tribonacci(n)
    if computed != expected:
        misconduct = True
        print(f"For n = {n}, Expected {expected}, Got {computed}")

if not misconduct:
    print("All tests passed!")
``` 

This will help you verify the functionality of the implemented solution. Let me know if you need any further refinement of the code!
