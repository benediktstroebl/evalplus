```python
def tri(n):
    seq, last_odd, last_even = [], 1, 3
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            seq.append(last_even)
            last_even = 1 + i / 2
        else:
            seq.append(last_odd)
            last_odd = seq[i - 1] + seq[i - 2] + last_even
    return seq
```

This Python script defines a function called `tri(n)` that calculates the first `n+1` terms of the Tribonacci sequence, which is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence but with different recurrence relations for odd and even indices. Here's a breakdown of how the function works:
1. The function starts an empty sequence `seq` and initializes two variables `last_odd` and `last_even` with the initial values 1 and 3, respectively. These variables will be used to keep track of the last odd and even Tribonacci numbers.
2. The function then enters a loop that iterates from `0` to `n`, where `n` is the input argument that determines the length of the Tribonacci sequence to generate.
3. Inside the loop, it checks whether the current index `i` is even or odd by using the modulo operator `%`. If `i` is even, it means we need to calculate the even Tribonacci number, so it appends the last even number (`last_even`) to the sequence `seq`. Then, it updates `last_even` to the value of 1 plus `i/`2. This follows the definition of the Tribonacci sequence for even indices.
4. If `i` is odd, it means we need to calculate the odd Tribonacci number, so it appends the last odd number (`last_odd`) to the sequence `seq`. Then, it updates `last_odd` to the sum of the last two odd Tribonacci numbers (`seq[i-1]` and `seq[i-2]`) plus the last even Tribonacci number (`last_even`). This follows the definition of the Tribonacci sequence for odd indices.
5. After iterating through all indices up to `n`, the function returns the sequence `seq`, which contains the first `n+1` terms of the Tribonacci sequence.
