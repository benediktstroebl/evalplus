```python
def tri(n):
    seq, last_odd, last_even = [], 1, 3
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            seq.append(last_even)
            last_even = 1 + i / 2
        else:
            seq.append(last_odd)
            last_odd = seq[i - 1] + seq[i - 2] + last_even
    return seq
``` 

This Python script defines a function called `tri(n)` that calculates the first `n+1` terms of the Tribonacci sequence, which is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence but with different recurrence relations for odd and even indices. Here's a breakdown of how the function works:
1. **List and Two Variables Initialization**: The function starts by initializing an empty list called `seq` that will store the Tribonacci sequence. It also initializes two variables, `last_odd` and `last_even`, with the initial values of 1 and 3, respectively. These variables will be used to keep track of the last odd and even Tribonacci numbers.
2. **Loop through Each Index `i`**: The function then enters a loop that iterates from `i = 0` up to `i = n` (where `n` is the input to the function). This loop will calculate each term of the Tribonacci sequence and append it to the `seq` list.
3. **Handling Even Indexes**: If the current index `i` is even (i.e., `i % 2 == 0` is `True`), the function calculates the next even Tribonacci number by summing the previous even number and the golden ratio (1 + `i / 2`). The `last_even` variable is updated to store this value. Then, the current even Tribonacci number is appended to the `seq` list.
4. **Handling Odd Indexes**: If the current index `i` is odd (i.e., `i % 2 == 0` is `False`), the function calculates the next odd Tribonacci number by summing the previous two odd numbers and the last even number. The `last_odd` variable is updated to store this value. Then, the current odd Tribonacci number is appended to the `seq` list.
5. **Return the Sequence**: After processing all indices, the function returns the `seq` list, which contains the first `n+1` terms of the Tribonacci sequence. 

The script ensures that the function works correctly for any input value of `n`, correctly calculating the Tribonacci sequence as described in the problem statement.
