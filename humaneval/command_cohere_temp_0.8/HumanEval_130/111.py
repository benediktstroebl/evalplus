```python
def tribonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    elif n == 1:
        return [1]
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return [1] + [n // 2] * (n // 2)
    else:
        return [1] + tribonacci(n - 1) + tribonacci(n - 2) + tribonacci(n + 1)
```
The function takes an input of type integer and returns a list of numbers of the Tribonacci sequence. It is implemented with three types of cases:
1. `n == 0`: it returns `[0]`
2. `n == 1`: it returns `[1]`
3. `n % 2 == 0`: it returns `[1] + [n // 2] * (n // 2)`
4. `n % 2 != 0`: it returns `[1] + tribonacci(n - 1) + tribonacci(n - 2) + tribonacci(n + 1)`

To implement this, it uses recursive calls to the tribonacci function, with appropriate assignments and returns. And since it's a kata, it is important to focus on efficiency and simplicity. So the code uses a simple if/else structure to reduce complexity and improve readability, and makes sure that the function is self-contained. 

To improve the efficiency, it is important to note that the recursive calls increase exponentially and could cause a maximum recursion depth error. So the next step could be solving it iteratively, however, the code above is a simple and neat solution to the problem statement.
