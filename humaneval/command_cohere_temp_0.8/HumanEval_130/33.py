```python
def tri(n):
    seq, last_odd, last_even = [], 1, 3
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            seq.append(last_even)
            last_even = last_even + 1
        else:
            seq.append(last_odd)
            last_odd = last_odd + last_even + seq[i - 2]
    return seq
```

The code defines a function 'tri()' which returns the Tribonacci sequence of numbers for `n+1` where `n` is the input to the function. It initializes an empty list `seq` to store the sequence and two variables, `last_odd` and `last_even`, with starting values of 1 and 3. These variables represent the last odd and even-positioned numbers generated in the sequence.

Then, a loop iterates through each position `i` from 1 to `n`, updating the sequence based on whether `i` is even or odd. If `i` is even, the current `last_even` value is appended to the sequence, and `last_even` is incremented by 1. If `i` is odd, the current `last_odd` value is appended to the sequence, and `last_odd` is updated by adding the sum of the previous two values in the sequence (`seq[i-2]`). This recurrence ensures that the Tribonacci sequence is generated correctly. Finally, the function returns the sequence of the first `n+1` numbers in the Tribonacci sequence.
