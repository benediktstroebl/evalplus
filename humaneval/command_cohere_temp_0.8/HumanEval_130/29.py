```python
def tri(n):
    result = [1, 3]
    if n > 1:
        result += [tri_even(n)]
        result += [tri_odd(n)]
    return result[:n+1]

def tri_even(n):
    return 1 + n // 2

def tri_odd(n):
    return tri_odd(n - 1) + tri_even(n - 2) + tri_even(n + 1)
```

The provided Python script solves the task of generating the Tribonacci sequence, which is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence but with different recurrence relations for even and odd indices. Here's how the script works:
1. The `tri()` function is the main function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list containing the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
2. It initializes the `result` list with the first two elements of the Tribonacci sequence: `result = [1, 3]`. These are the base cases for the recurrence relations.
3. If `n` is greater than 1, it needs to calculate the Tribonacci numbers for both even and odd indices and append them to the `result` list.
4. The `tri_even()` function calculates the Tribonacci number for an even index `n` using the recurrence relation: `tri_even(n) = 1 + n // 2`. It returns this value.
5. The `tri_odd()` function calculates the Tribonacci number for an odd index `n` using the recurrence relation: `tri_odd(n) = tri_odd(n - 1) + tri_even(n - 2) + tri_even(n + 1)`. It recursively calls itself with `n - 1` and `n - 2` and adds the result to the answer. Then, it recursively calls `tri_even()` with `n + 1` and adds that result as well.
6. Finally, the `tri()` function appends the results of `tri_even()` and `tri_odd()` to the `result` list, which now contains the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence. It returns the `result` list truncated to only include the first `n + 1` elements (if `n` is large, it may return more than `n + 1` elements).

This approach ensures that the `tri()` function generates the correct Tribonacci sequence for any non-negative integer `n`.
