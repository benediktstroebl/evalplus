```python
def tri(n):
    seq, last_odd, last_even = [], 1, 3
    while len(seq) < n + 1:
        if len(seq) % 2 == 0:
            seq.append(last_even)
            last_even = last_even + last_odd + seq[-1]
        else:
            seq.append(seq[-1] + seq[-2] + last_odd)
            last_odd = seq[-1] + seq[-2] + last_even
    return seq[:n+1]
``` 

This Python script defines a function called `tri(n)` that generates the first `n+1` numbers in the Tribonacci sequence, which is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence but with different recurrence relations for odd and even indices. Here's a breakdown of how the function works:
1. It starts an empty list `seq` to store the Tribonacci numbers and initializes two variables `last_odd` and `last_even` with the initial values 1 and 3, respectively.
2. It enters a loop that continues until the length of `seq` is greater than `n`. This loop builds the Tribonacci sequence incrementally.
3. Inside the loop, it checks whether the index is even or odd to determine which recurrence relation to use to generate the next Tribonacci number.
4. If the index is even, it appends the current value of `last_even` to `seq` and updates `last_even` to the sum of its previous value, `last_odd`, and the last number in `seq`.
5. If the index is odd, it appends the sum of the last two numbers in `seq` and the current value of `last_odd` to `seq` and updates `last_odd` to the sum of its previous value, the last number in `seq`, and `last_even`.
6. After each iteration, the function moves forward by appending the newly calculated Tribonacci number to the sequence.
7. Once the loop completes, it returns the first `n+1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence as requested.
