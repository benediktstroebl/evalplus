```python
def tribonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    elif n == 1:
        return [1]
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return [0] + tribonacci(n - 1)
    else:
        return [1] + tribonacci(n - 1) + tribonacci(n - 2) + tribonacci(n + 1)
```

The function approaches the problem by breaking it down into three base cases and a recursive case. The first base case is when `n == 0`, in which case it returns `[0]`, as `0` is the first number in the Tribonacci sequence. The second base case is when `n == 1`, in which case it returns `[1]`, as `1` is the second number in the Tribonacci sequence. The third base case is when `n` is even, in which case it returns `[0] + tribonacci(n - 1)`, as even indices are related to the previous odd index. As all other cases are handled recursively, this covers the recursive case. 

The recursive cases are when `n` is odd, and also when `n > 1`. For these cases, the function returns `[1] + tribonacci(n - 1) + tribonacci(n - 2) + tribonacci(n + 1)`. This is because odd indices are related to the sum of the previous 3 indices in the sequence. Are these cases cover all cases for the Tribonacci sequence? If so, feel free to proceed with the next problem or ask me for another clarification.
