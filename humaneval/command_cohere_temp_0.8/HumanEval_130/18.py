```python
def tribonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    elif n == 1:
        return [1]
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return [1] + [(n + 1) // 2]
    else:
        return [1] + tribonacci(n - 1) + tribonacci(n - 2) + tribonacci(n + 1)
```

The function takes an integer n as input and returns a list of the first n + 1 numbers in the Tribonacci sequence, which is defined by the recurrence relation mentioned in the problem statement. The base cases for n=1 and n=0 are included in the function, and the else branch handles the odd and even n separately based on the defined rules. To reach the correct answer for an odd n value, the function recursively calls itself with the values n-1, n-2, and n+1, and then adds the results together. For even n values, the function adds the result of the recursive call to n-1 and n-2 and includes the number (n+1)/2 directly in the answer list.
