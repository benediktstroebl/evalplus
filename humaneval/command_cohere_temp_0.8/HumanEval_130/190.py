```python
def tri(n):
    seq, last_odd, last_even = [], 1, 3
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            seq.append(last_even)
            last_even = last_even + 1
        else:
            seq.append(last_odd)
            last_odd = last_odd + last_even + seq[i - 2]
    return seq
```

The code defines a function 'tri()' that calculates the Tribonacci sequence by maintaining two variables, `last_even` and `last_odd`, which hold the values of the last even and odd-indexed Tribonacci numbers, respectively. It then iterates through the range of up to `n+1` to populate the sequence, updating the values accordingly. 

To understand the logic behind this code, please refer to the explanation provided in the previous response. 

To ensure the code works correctly and efficiently, it's essential to consider performance optimizations, such as ensuring the loop terminates correctly and not exposing any vulnerabilities that could lead to infinite loops or other errors. 

The given code and explanation provide a clear illustration of how to generate the Tribonacci sequence, enhancing code readability and practicality.
