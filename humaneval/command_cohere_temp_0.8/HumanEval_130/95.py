This code defines a function 'tri()' that takes a 'num' as an input and creates a list of the tribonacci sequence up to the provided number 'num' and returns it. 

The code is self-contained and does not rely on any external modules or variables, therefore it can be executed independently. 
The code works as follows:
1. The function first checks if the input is 0, in which case it creates an empty list because there are noTribonacci numbers defined up to zero. Otherwise, it initializes the list with the first two elements of the Tribonacci sequence, 1 and 3, accordingly to the definition of the Tribonacci sequence provided in the prompt.
2. Then, it iterates over the indices from 2 to 'n' (exclusive). It either calculates the value of the Tribonacci number at the current index based on the definition if the current index is odd, or it assigns the value to be the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence if the current index is even. 
3. Ultimately, the function returns the list containing the first 'n + 1' numbers of the Tribonacci sequence. It is important to note, that this code is inefficient because it recalculates some of the Tribonacci numbers multiple times, causing an exponential time complexity instead of the linear time complexity that is possible for this type of sequence. For example, in the very first iteration, it unnecessarily recalculates the value of tri(2) in the loop, when it could have just assigned that value to be 2 in the initialization of the list. 
Overall, the code creates and returns the list of the Tribonacci sequence up to the 'n'.
