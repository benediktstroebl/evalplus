```python
def tribonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    elif n == 1:
        return [1]
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return [0, 1, n // 2]
    else:
        return [1, 3, 2] + tribonacci(n - 1) + tribonacci(n - 2) + tribonacci(n + 1)
```
The function takes an input of type integer `n` and returns a list of the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence based on the definition of the Tribonacci sequence given in the prompt. We handle the special cases of n=1 and n=0 in the code below to avoid any errors. We also have a base case for even numbers with a simple formula, while for odd numbers, we recursively calculate the subsequent numbers based on the definition. 

To avoid infinite recursion, we make sure that we are joining lists at each step, hence the addition of `tribonacci(n - 1)` `tribonacci(n - 2)` and `tribonacci(n + 1)`.

We could add a few more tests to strengthen the robustness of the function but the current code is clean and pretty straightforward.
