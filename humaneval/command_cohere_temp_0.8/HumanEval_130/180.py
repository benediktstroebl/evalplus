```python
def tri(n):
    seq, last_odd, last_even = [], 1, 3
    while len(seq) < n + 1:
        if len(seq) % 2 == 0:
            seq.append(last_even)
            last_even = last_even + last_odd + seq[-1]
        else:
            seq.append(seq[-1] + seq[-2] + last_odd)
            last_odd = last_odd + seq[-1]
    return seq[:n+1]
``` 

The problem asks us to generate the first `n + 1` numbers in the Tribonacci sequence, which is defined as follows:
- `tri(1) = 3`
- `tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even`
- `tri(n) = tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd`

We approach this sequentially:
1. We initialize an empty sequence `seq` to store our generated numbers, and seed the initial values with `last_odd` and `last_even` values.
2. We enter a loop that iterates until the length of the sequence `seq` is less than `n + 1`. This guarantees that we generate all required Tribonacci numbers.
3. In each iteration of the loop, we check if the length of the sequence `seq` is even. If it is, we append the updated `last_even` value to the sequence. `last_even` is updated based on the definition of the Tribonacci sequence.
4. If the length of the sequence `seq` is odd, we append the updated `last_odd` value to the sequence. The updating of `last_odd` is also based on the definition of the Tribonacci sequence.
5. The loop will terminate when the length of the sequence `seq` is at least `n + 1`.
6. Finally, we return the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence as specified by the problem.

This approach is efficient and can generate the Tribonacci sequence on-the-fly with linear (O(n)) space complexity and linear (O(n)) time complexity.
