```python
def tribonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    elif n == 1:
        return [1]
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return [1] + [(n // 2) * 2 + 1]
    else:
        return [1] + tribonacci(n - 2) + tribonacci(n - 1) + tribonacci(n + 1)
```
The function implements the logic for generating the Tribonacci sequence based on the recurrence relations provided in the problem description. It uses a similar approach to the Fibonacci sequence but with different recurrence relations for odd and even indices. The function returns a list of the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence as required by the problem. Feel free to experiment with different inputs and observe how the function responds. Let me know if you would like to further discuss any aspect of the implementation.
