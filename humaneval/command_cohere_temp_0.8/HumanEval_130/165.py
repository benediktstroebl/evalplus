```python
def tri(n):
    if n == 0:
        return []
    if n == 1:
        return [1]
    result = [1, 3]
    if n % 2 == 0:
        for i in range(1, n):
            result.append(1 + i // 2)
    else:
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            result.append(result[i - 1] + result[i - 2] + result[i])
    return result
``` 

The code defines a Python function called `tri(n)` that generates the first `n + 1` numbers in the Tribonacci sequence. The Tribonacci sequence is an extension of the Fibonacci sequence where each term is the sum of the previous two terms. To achieve this, the code checks if `n` is 0 or 1, returns an empty list or just the number 1 respectively. If `n` is greater than 1, the function initializes the result list with the first two terms of the Tribonacci sequence `(1, 3)`. 

For even values of `n`, the loop iterates through values from 2 to `n` and appends the subsequent Tribonacci number, which is calculated as `1 + i / 2`, to the `result` list. For odd values of `n`, the loop iterates from 3 to `n + 1`, and for each value, the function calculates the Tribonacci number by summing the previous two terms of the sequence stored in `result`. 

Ultimately, this method allows the `tri` function to return the correct `n + 1` first terms of the Tribonacci sequence.
