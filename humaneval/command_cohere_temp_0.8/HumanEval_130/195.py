```python
def tri(n):
    seq, last_odd, last_even = [], 1, 3
    while len(seq) < n + 1:
        if len(seq) % 2 == 0:
            seq.append(last_even)
            last_even = 1 + last_even // 2
        else:
            seq.append(sum(seq[-2:] + [last_odd]))
            last_odd = seq[-1]
    return seq[:n+1]
``` 

The problem defines the Tribonacci sequence as a sequence of numbers where the odd-positioned terms are defined by the Fibonacci sequence, and the even-positioned terms are defined by the formula `1 + n/2`. This is repeated for each position `n` until the sequence length reaches `n + 1`. 

The Python script provided implements the definition of the Tribonacci sequence to generate the first `n + 1` terms of the sequence based on the problem description. 

To achieve this, the algorithm follows these steps:
1. Initialize an empty sequence `seq`, and initialize two variables `last_odd` and `last_even` with the first two values of the Tribonacci sequence (1 and 3).
2. Enter a loop that continues until the length of `seq` is less than `n + 1`.
3. Inside the loop, check if the length of `seq` is even. If it is, append `last_even` to `seq`, and update `last_even` to the next value in the sequence (`1 + last_even // 2`).
4. If the length of `seq` is odd, append the sum of the last three values in the sequence (`seq[-2:] + [last_odd]`)) to `seq`, and update `last_odd` to the new last value.
5. Repeat the loop until the length of the sequence reaches `n + 1`.
6. Return the first `n + 1` terms of the sequence. 

This algorithm efficiently generates the required number of terms in the Tribonacci sequence, as it recursively builds the sequence based on the defined rules for odd and even-positioned terms. 

Note that this approach has a time complexity of `O(n)` since the sequence grows one term at a time, and space complexity of `O(1)` as it only stores the current terms required for calculation.
