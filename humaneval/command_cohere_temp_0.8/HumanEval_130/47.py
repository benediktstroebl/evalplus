```python
def tri(n):
    Sequence = [1, 3]
    if n <= 1:
        return Sequence[:n+1]
    else:
        a, b, c = Sequence[-1:]
        odd = n % 2
        even = not odd
        x1 = a if odd else a + b
        x2 = b if even else b + c
        x3 = c if odd else c + a
        Sequence.extend([x1, x2, x3])
        return Sequence[:n+1]
``` 

The code defines a Python function called `tri(n)` that generates the first `n+1` numbers in the Tribonacci sequence. This sequence follows a specific recurrence relation: for odd values of `n`, it's `a + b + c`, for even values of `n`, it's `a + (n/2) + c`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last three terms of the sequence. The function starts with the initial terms of the sequence, `[1, 3]`, and then uses conditional statements to calculate the next terms based on whether `n` is odd or even. It then appends these calculated values to the `Sequence` list and returns the first `n+1` numbers of the sequence. 

The code is self-contained and doesn't rely on external variables or functions, making it modular and easy to test. It efficiently computes the Tribonacci sequence and returns the desired range of numbers.
