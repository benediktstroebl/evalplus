```python
def tri(n):
    seq, last_odd, last_even = [], 1, 3
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            seq.append(last_even)
            last_even = 1 + i / 2
        else:
            seq.append(last_odd)
            last_odd = seq[i - 1] + seq[i - 2] + last_even
    return seq
```

This code defines a function called `tri(n)` that calculates the Tribonacci sequence for the first `n+1` numbers and returns it as a list.

It initializes an empty list `seq` to store the sequence and assigns the first two values of the sequence to `last_even` (3) and `last_odd` (1), respectively. The loop iterates from 1 to `n+1`. For each iteration, it checks if the index `i` is even or odd to determine the next value in the sequence based on the recurrence relation. If `i` is even, it calculates `last_even` as `1 + i/2` and appends it to `seq`, updating `last_even` for the next iteration. If `i` is odd, it calculates `last_odd` as the sum of the two previous values in the sequence and appends it to `seq`, updating `last_odd` for the next iteration. This process is repeated until `n+1` iterations have been completed, effectively building the Tribonacci sequence and returning it as a list.
