```python
def tribonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    elif n == 1:
        return [1]
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return [0, 1, n // 2]
    else:
        return [1, 3, 2] + tribonacci(n - 1) + tribonacci(n - 2) + tribonacci(n + 1)
```
The function takes an input of type integer `n` and returns a list of the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence. This is achieved via basic recursive understanding of the Tribonacci sequence, where mostly the return is based on the type of odd or even of `n`. We handle the base cases if `n` is 0, `n` is 1, and if `n` is even. Otherwise, we return 1, 3, and 2 for the first three numbers for odd `n` and then concatenate the rest by recursively calling the function for `n - 1`, `n - 2`, and `n + 1` respectively.

To further enhance the readability and simplicity of the code, we can also use a loop-based approach:
```python
def tribonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    elif n == 1:
        return [1]
    list_of_trib = [1, 3, 2]
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            list_of_trib.append(i // 2)
        else:
            list_of_trib.append(list_of_trib[i - 1] + list_of_trib[i - 2] + list_of_trib[i + 1])
    return list_of_trib
```

This alternative approach avoids recursion and thus improves the efficiency and readability of the function, which is less prone to stack overflow errors. It also reduces the complexity from O(2^n) to O(n). In the loop, we check if the current number is even or odd to decide what to append to the list, and then we loop through the required range and populate the list of Tribonacci numbers. These approaches should provide the correct solution to the problem as outlined in the example. Let me know if you want me to explain any part of the solution or provide any further optimizations.
