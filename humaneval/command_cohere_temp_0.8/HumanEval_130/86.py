```python
def tribonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    elif n == 1:
        return [1]
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return [0, 1, n // 2]
    else:
        return [1, 3, 2] + tribonacci(n - 1) + tribonacci(n - 2) + tribonacci(n + 1)
```
The function takes an input of type integer, `n`, and returns a list of the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence based on the definition of the Tribonacci sequence given in the prompt. This definition is recursively applied to evenly index numbers, while odd index numbers are calculated as the sum of the previous 3 Tribonacci sequence numbers. The base case conditions handle cases where `n` is 0, 1, and even/odd for the Tribonacci sequence values. 

This approach enables the function to construct the Tribonacci sequence from the provided definition. 

To run the code locally, ensure that you have Python installed. Copy the code and save it as a `.py` file (e.g., `tribonacci.py`). Then, run the script in your terminal using the command `python tribonacci.py`. 

This code defines a function and returns the Tribonacci sequence number for the given input using the defined logic for the sequence. Let me know if this solution works for you or if you would like to dive deeper into the code!
