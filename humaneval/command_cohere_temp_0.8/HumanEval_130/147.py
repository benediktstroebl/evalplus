```python
def tri(n):
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    elif n == 1:
        return [1]
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return [0] + tri(n - 1)
    else:
        return [1] + tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1)
```

The code defines a function `tri(n)` that returns the first `n + 1` elements of the Tribonacci sequence. This sequence is defined as follows:
- `tri(1) = 3`
- `tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even`
- `tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd`

The function handles the base cases (`n == 0`, `n == 1`, and `n` even) separately, and then constructs the sequence by combining the odd and even terms accordingly. The result is a list of the first `n + 1` Tribonacci numbers.
