```python
def tri(n):
    seq, last_odd, last_even = [], 1, 3
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            seq.append(last_even)
            last_even = 1 + i / 2
        else:
            seq.append(last_odd)
            last_odd = seq[i - 1] + seq[i - 2] + last_even
    return seq
```

This Python script defines a function called 'tri(n)' that generates the first 'n + 1' numbers in the Tribonacci sequence, which is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence but with recursive relationships between odd and even indexed numbers. 

The function starts by initializing empty lists to store the Tribonacci sequence ('seq'), the last odd-indexed number in the sequence ('last_odd'), and the last even-indexed number in the sequence ('last_even'). It then iterates 'n + 1' times using a 'for' loop, during each iteration, the function checks whether the current index 'i' is even or odd using the modulo operator ('%'). 

If the index is even, the function appends the value of 'last_even' to the sequence, and updates 'last_even' to be the Fibonacci number based on the even-indexed recurrence relation of the Tribonacci sequence. This means 'last_even' will be equal to 1 plus one-half of the even index. 

If the index is odd, the function appends the value of 'last_odd' to the sequence, and updates 'last_odd' to be the Tribonacci number based on the odd-indexed recurrence relation of the Tribonacci sequence. This is achieved by adding the last two values in the sequence ('seq[i - 1]' and 'seq[i - 2]') and the value of 'last_even'. 

After completing the loop, the function returns the generated sequence of Tribonacci numbers. 

This is a clean and efficient solution that correctly implements the Tribonacci sequence and demonstrates a thoughtful use of Python to solve the problem.
