```python
def tri(n):
    sequence, last_odd, last_even = [], 1, 3
    while len(sequence) < n + 1:
        if len(sequence) % 2 == 0:
            sequence.append(last_even)
            last_even = last_even + last_odd + next_odd
            last_odd, next_odd = last_odd + 1, last_odd + 2
        else:
            sequence.append(last_odd)
            last_odd = last_odd + last_even + next_even
            last_even, next_even = last_even + 1, last_even + 2
    return sequence
```

The code defines a function 'tri()' which uses two 'while' loops to generate the Tribonacci sequence of length `n + 1`, where the first loop determines if the current term is odd or even based on the length of the sequence, and the second loop updates the Tribonacci sequence accordingly. The solution is timed out for `n = 10^9`.
