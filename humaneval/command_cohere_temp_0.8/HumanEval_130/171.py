```python
def tri(n):
    out = [0,1,3]
    if len(out) < n + 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            out.extend([1 + n//2] * (n + 1))
        else:
            for i in range(1, n + 1, 2):
                out.append(out[i - 1] + out[i - 2] + out[i])
    return out[:n+1]
``` 

The problem asks us to generate the first `n + 1` terms of the Tribonacci sequence, which is defined as follows:
- `tri(1) = 3`
- `tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even`
- `tri(n) = tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd`

To solve this, we can define a list `out` to store the first three terms of the sequence (as specified in the hint). We then extend this list with the appropriate values for odd and even n using nested loops. Finally, we return the list `out` trimmed to the first `n + 1` elements. 

This solution efficiently computes the requested number of terms of the Tribonacci sequence.
