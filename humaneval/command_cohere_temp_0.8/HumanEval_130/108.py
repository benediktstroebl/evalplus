```python
def tribonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    elif n == 1:
        return [1]
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return [0] + tribonacci(n - 1)
    else:
        return [1] + tribonacci(n - 1) + tribonacci(n - 2) + tribonacci(n + 1)
```
The function implements the Tribonacci sequence based on the provided definition. It uses recursive calls with different parameters depending on whether `n` is even or odd. If `n` is even, it returns `0` as the current element, and if `n` is odd, it returns `1` as the current element, and then recursively calculates the previous two elements accordingly. The result is a list of the first `n + 1` numbers in the Tribonacci sequence.
