```python
def tri(n):
    seq, last_odd, last_even = [], 1, 3
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            seq.append(last_even)
            last_even = 1 + i / 2
        else:
            seq.append(last_odd)
            last_odd = seq[i - 1] + seq[i - 2] + last_even
    return seq
```

The code defines a function 'tri()' that generates the Tribonacci sequence by maintaining two variables, `last_even` and `last_odd`, which represent the last even and odd-indexed Tribonacci numbers respectively. It then iterates through the range of up to `n+1` and checks if the index is even or odd. If the index is even, it appends the current `last_even` value to the sequence and updates it to `1 + i/2` for the next even index. If the index is odd, it appends the current `last_odd` value and updates it to the sum of the two previous odd-indexed Tribonacci numbers and the last even-indexed Tribonacci number. This process effectively generates the Tribonacci sequence up to a given `n`.
