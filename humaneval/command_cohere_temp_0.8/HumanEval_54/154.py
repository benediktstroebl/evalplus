Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return len(set(s0) & set(s1)) / min(len(s0), len(s1)) > 0.6
```
The function same_chars compares two input strings, s0 and s1, to determine if they have a similar set of characters. It does so by calculating the Jaccard index, which measures the similarity between two sets, in this case, the sets of characters present in the input strings. The Jaccard index is calculated by finding the intersection of characters present in both strings (using the & operator for set intersection) and then comparing this to the minimum of the lengths of both strings. The result is returned as a boolean value: True if the calculated Jaccard index is greater than 0.6, indicating that the strings share a large proportion of characters, and False otherwise.  This method allows for an intuitive determination of whether two strings share a substantial set of characters.
