```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return sorted(s0) == sorted(s1)
```
```python
# Test Suite
def test_same_chars():
    assert same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc') == True
    assert same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabc') == True
    assert same_chars('dddddddabc', 'abcd') == True
    assert same_chars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc') == False
    assert same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabce') == False
    assert same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddddabc') == False
```

The function `same_chars` works by sorting the characters in both strings, then comparing the sorted strings to see if they are the same. This approach ensures that the order in which characters appear in the strings does not affect the result. The test suite verifies the function's behavior against various scenarios. Each test case checks a specific condition and asserts if the function's result matches the expected outcome. 

To run the test suite, you can copy the test case and paste it into a Python interpreter or IDE, which will then execute the tests and display the results. If the `same_chars` function is implemented correctly, all tests should pass without any errors.  This provides assurance that the function behaves as expected and gives a complete test coverage, covering various scenarios related to the problem.
