```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return sorted(s0) == sorted(s1)
```
```python
def test_same_chars():
    assert same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc') == True
    assert same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabc') == True
    assert same_chars('dddddddabc', 'abcd') == True
    assert same_chars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc') == False
    assert same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabce') == False
    assert same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddddabc') == False
```

The function `same_chars` is defined to check whether two input strings, `s0` and `s1`, have the same characters. It does so by sorting the characters in each string and comparing the sorted versions. The `==` operator checks for element-wise equality between the two lists, returning a Boolean value that indicates whether the strings have the same characters or not. 

The `test_same_chars` function is provided to verify the behavior of the `same_chars` function against various test cases. It asserts the output of `same_chars` against expected truth values using the `== True` and `== False` assertions. 

Overall, the script provides a self-contained solution to the problem in a concise and clear manner.  Assuming that the problem is to check if two words have the same characters in markdown code block.
