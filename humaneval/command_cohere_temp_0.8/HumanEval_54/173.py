Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return len(set(s0) & set(s1)) / min(len(s0), len(s1)) > 0.6
```
This function works by comparing the unique characters in both strings and then calculating the similarity ratio using the formula:
```
similarity = (common_characters / min(|s0|, |s1|))
```
Here, `|s0|` and `|s1|` represent the lengths of the input strings s0 and s1, and `common_characters` represents the number of unique characters that appear in both strings. 

The resulting value is compared to 0.6, which is 60% similarity. This means that if the strings have more than 60% of common unique characters, the function returns `True`, indicating that the strings have a similar composition of characters. 

 Otherwise, the function returns `False`, indicating that the strings have different character compositions. 

You can use this function to solve the problem and test it with different cases to ensure that it behaves as expected, as demonstrated in the provided tests. 
```python
def test_same_chars():
    assert same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc')
    assert same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabc')
    assert same_chars('dddddddabc', 'abcd')
    assert not same_chars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc')
    assert not same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabce')
    assert not same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddddabc')
``` 
This approach provides a straightforward and effective solution to the problem.
