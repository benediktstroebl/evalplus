Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return len(set(s0) & set(s1)) / min(len(s0), len(s1)) > 0.6
```
This function works by comparing the unique characters in both strings and checking whether a significant portion of them overlap. The threshold 0.6 was chosen somewhat arbitrarily, as there is no universally agreed-upon definition for what constitutes "essentially the same." However, it should capture the spirit of the problem's requirement. 
To use this function in the context of the provided tests, simply add the following:
```python
# Test Case from Problem Statement
>>> same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc')
True
>>> same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabc')
True
>>> same_chars('dddddddabc', 'abcd')
True
>>> same_chars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc')
False
>>> same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabce')
False
>>> same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddddabc')
False
``` 
This would execute each of the test cases from the problem statement and print the resulting boolean values for each assertion.
