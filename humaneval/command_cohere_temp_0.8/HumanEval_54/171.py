```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return len(set(s0) & set(s1)) / min(len(s0), len(s1)) > 0.6
```

The function leverages the similarity between two strings (`s0` and `s1`) by calculating the shared character ratio using the formula: `Shared Characters / Minimum Length of String`. The result is compared to a threshold value (0.6 in this case).

To test the function, you can use the following code:
```python
test_strings = [
    ("eabcdzzzz", "dddzzzzzzzddeddabc"),
    ("abcd", "dddddddabc"),
    ("dddddddabc", "abcd"),
    ("eabcd", "dddddddabc"),
    ("abcd", "dddddddabce"),
    ("eabcdzzzz", "dddzzzzzzzddddabc")
]

for string_pair in test_strings:
    assert same_chars(*string_pair) == True
```

This script ensures that the `same_chars()` function works correctly for various test cases. Adjust the threshold value to decide when two strings are considered to have the same characters.
