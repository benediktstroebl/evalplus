Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return len(set(s0) & set(s1)) / min(len(s0), len(s1)) > 0.6
```
This function works by comparing the unique characters in both strings and then calculating the percentage of matching characters between them, returning True if it's greater than 60% and False otherwise.
