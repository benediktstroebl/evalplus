Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return len(set(s0) & set(s1)) / min(len(s0), len(s1)) > 0.6
```
The function works by comparing the unique characters in both strings and checking whether a large fraction of them are the same, which is achieved using the set intersection operation and calculating the fraction of matching characters. 

Here's how you can test this function against the provided tests:
```python
test_cases = [
    ("eabcdzzzz", "dddzzzzzzzddeddabc", True),
    ("abcd", "dddddddabc", True),
    ("dddddddabc", "abcd", True),
    ("eabcd", "dddddddabc", False),
    ("abcd", "dddddddabce", False),
    ("eabcdzzzz", "dddzzzzzzzddddabc", False)
]

for idx, (s0, s1, expected) in enumerate(test_cases):
    output = same_chars(s0, s1)
    assert output == expected, f"Test case {idx+1} failed. Expected {expected}, but got {output}."
```
You can use this code to validate the function against the provided tests.
