Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return len(set(s0) & set(s1)) / min(len(s0), len(s1)) > 0.6
```
The function works by comparing the unique characters in both strings and checking whether a large proportion of them are the same, which is achieved using the set intersection operation and proportion calculation. 

This approach provides a quick way to determine if two strings share a similar composition of characters, which is the essence of the problem. 
Here's a markdown code block with a corresponding test to provide further insight into how to verify the correctness of the function:
```python
```python
import string
import random

def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return len(set(s0) & set(s1)) / min(len(s0), len(s1)) > 0.6

def test_same_chars():
    # Test strings of different lengths
    assert same_chars('abc', 'abcdef')
    assert same_chars('abc', 'abcdefg')
    
    # Test strings with similar characters
    assert same_chars('aaaaaaa', 'bbbbbbbb')
    assert same_chars('aaaaaaa', 'bbbbbbbbbbbb')
    
    # Test strings with different characters
    assert not same_chars('aaaaaaa', 'bbbbbbbbb')
    assert not same_chars('abc', 'zzzzzzzz')
    
    # Test with random strings
    for _ in range(50):
        s0 = ''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_lowercase) for _ in range(random.randint(5, 10)))
        s1 = ''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_lowercase) for _ in range(random.randint(5, 10)))
        assert same_chars(s0, s1) == (len(set(s0) & set(s1)) / min(len(s0), len(s1)) > 0.6)

test_same_chars()
```

The test_same_chars function utilizes a variety range of test scenarios to validate the same_chars function, including tests for strings of varying lengths, sequences of similar characters, differing characters, and random strings. 

Running this test suite on the code should provide assurance that the function works correctly.
