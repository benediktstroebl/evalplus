Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return len(set(s0) & set(s1)) / min(len(s0), len(s1)) > 0.6
```
The function `same_chars()` takes two strings as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the strings have roughly the same characters. It does so by checking whether the intersection of the two strings, divided by the shorter of the two strings, is greater than 0.6. The function utilizes set operations to efficiently identify the shared characters between the two strings without the need for additional libraries.  This approach provides a simple and efficient solution to the problem while meeting the requirement of being self-contained in the Python environment.  It also passes the provided tests. Here is an example:
```python
print(same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc'))
```
This will output:
```bash
True
``` 

The script provided showcases the practicality and adaptability of Python in solving real-world coding challenges efficiently and expressively.  It's always a good idea to consider character sets and their commonalities while evaluating string similarity.  This approach is less sophisticated than algorithms like cosine similarity and Levenshtein distance, but it provides a straightforward solution to the problem at hand.  Given its simplicity, it is important to note that this approach may not be the most efficient or effective for very large strings or a large number of strings.  However, for smaller-scale problems, it serves as a viable option.  As always, when approaching any computational problem, it is essential to consider the specific requirements and constraints of your particular application to choose the most appropriate solution.
