Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return len(set(s0) & set(s1)) / max(len(s0), len(s1)) > 0.5
```
This function employs set theory and the ratio of matching characters to solve the problem. It returns True when the characters are roughly half the same, indicating that the strings share many characters, regardless of their length or how they are distributed.  This method provides a straightforward solution to the problem:
1.  **Understanding**: The code divides the characters of both strings into a set and calculates the ratio of overlapping characters between the sets.
2.  **Simplicity**: The use of sets and ratios to compare characters makes the solution easy to comprehend. 
3.  ** generality**: It can handle any string without relying on pattern matching or specific word/character checks. It's worth noting, however, that this solution assumes alphabetical characters do not consider string length directly. It might provide false positives for extremely long strings with a small number of matching characters.  If the input strings contain irrelevant or noise characters, the functionality may decrease. The threshold of 0.5 might also need to be adjusted based on application-specific needs.  Overall, it provides an efficient and general approach to comparing characters.
