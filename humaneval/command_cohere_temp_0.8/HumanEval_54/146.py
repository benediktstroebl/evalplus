Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return len(set(s0) & set(s1)) / min(len(s0), len(s1)) > 0.6
```

The function `same_chars()` takes two strings as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the strings have approximately the same characters. The test suite includes examples showing how the function behaves for various cases. 
Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc'))
```

The output will be:
```
True
```

The function will return `True` since the two strings have a large overlapping segment and this common portion constitutes at least 60% of the smaller string between the two.
