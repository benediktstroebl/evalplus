```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return sorted(s0) == sorted(s1)
```
```python
# Test Suite
def test_same_chars():
    assert same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc') == True
    assert same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabc') == True
    assert same_chars('dddddddabc', 'abcd') == True
    assert same_chars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc') == False
    assert same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabce') == False
    assert same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddddabc') == False
```

The function `same_chars` works by sorting the characters in both words, then checking whether the two sorted strings are equal. This is a case-sensitive comparison, so it will not consider characters with different cases to be the same. 

The test suite contains several test cases that check if the function behaves as expected for various inputs. You can use these tests to verify that the code behaves correctly for different inputs. 

You can use the `assert` statement to check if the output of the `same_chars` function is correct for a given input. If the assertion passes, it means the function gives the expected output. If the assertion fails, it throws an error, indicating the function produces an unexpected output. 

The test suite is a useful tool to ensure that the function works correctly and behaves as expected. Itâ€™s a great practice to have test cases that cover multiple scenarios, as it helps to ensure the function is reliable and robust. You can add more test cases to the test suite to cover a wider range of scenarios if needed.
