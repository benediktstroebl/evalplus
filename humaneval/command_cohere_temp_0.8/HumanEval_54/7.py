```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return len(set(s0) & set(s1)) / min(len(s0), len(s1)) > 0.6
```

The function employs the sets `set(s0)` and `set(s1)` to extract unique characters from the input strings and assesses the intersection of these sets geometrically:
The condition `len(set(s0) & set(s1)) / min(len(s0), len(s1)) > 0.6` calculates the fraction of common characters between the two strings. It divides the count of overlapping characters by the minimum of the lengths of the two strings. This approach allows for a flexible comparison that considers strings of differing lengths and varying numeric densities. 

The problem entails identifying strings that share a majority of characters, irrespective of their lengths or the specific characters present. This method achieves that objective, providing a robust and adaptable solution. 

This approach allows the function to effectively determine if two strings have a large proportion of overlapping characters, fulfilling the requirements of the problem.
