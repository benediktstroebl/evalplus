```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return sorted(s0) == sorted(s1)
```

The function `same_chars(s0, s1)` checks if two strings have the same characters independent of their position by comparing the sorted versions of both strings. It returns `True` if the sorted strings are equal and `False` otherwise. This approach takes advantage of the fact that sorting ignores the position of the characters while ensuring that any distinct character in the string gets propagated to the same position in the sorted result. 

Here is a test suite to ensure that the function behaves as expected:
```python
def test_same_chars():
    assert same_chars("eabcdzzzz", "dddzzzzzzzddeddabc")  # Test 1: Should return True
    assert same_chars("abcd", "dddddddabc")  # Test 2: Should return True
    assert same_chars("dddddddabc", "abcd")  # Test 3: Should return True
    assert not same_chars("eabcd", "dddddddabc")  # Test 4: Should return False
    assert not same_chars("abcd", "dddddddabce")  # Test 5: Should return False
    assert not same_chars("eabcdzzzz", "dddzzzzzzzddddabc")  # Test 6: Should return False

test_same_chars()
```

The test suite includes six tests, each of which corresponds to a specific scenario in the original problem statement. By executing the `test_same_chars()` function, we can verify that the `same_chars()` function behaves as expected for each scenario.
