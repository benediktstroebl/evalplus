Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return sorted(s0) == sorted(s1)
```
The above `same_chars` function hashes two strings and returns true if the sorted hashes are the same, indicating both strings have the same characters.
