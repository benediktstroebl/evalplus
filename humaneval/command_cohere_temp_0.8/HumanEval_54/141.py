Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return len(set(s0) & set(s1)) / max(len(s0), len(s1)) > 0.5
```
The function evaluates to true if the sets of characters in the two strings are roughly the same size, indicating that they have a high percentage of shared characters, and vice versa.
