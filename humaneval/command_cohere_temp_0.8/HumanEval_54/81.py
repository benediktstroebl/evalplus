Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return len(set(s0) & set(s1)) / min(len(s0), len(s1)) > 0.6
```
The function same_chars returns True if two strings have more than 60% character matches or False otherwise. 
This approach uses set theory to compute character matches between two strings in an efficient manner.
