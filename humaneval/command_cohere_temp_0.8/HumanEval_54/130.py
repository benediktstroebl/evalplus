```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return sorted(s0) == sorted(s1)
```
```python
# Test Suite
def test_same_chars():
    assert same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc') == True
    assert same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabc') == True
    assert same_chars('dddddddabc', 'abcd') == True
    assert same_chars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc') == False
    assert same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabce') == False
    assert same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddddabc') == False
```

The function `same_chars` works by sorting the characters in both words, then checking whether the sorted words are the same. This approach ensures that the words have the same characters, regardless of their original order. 

The test suite includes test cases for various scenarios, and these tests can be modified to fit your needs. 

This solution requires only one line of code and offers a simple and effective solution to the problem.
