```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return len(set(s0) & set(s1)) / min(len(s0), len(s1)) > 0.6
```

The function leverages the universality of the `set` constructor to automatically filter out distinct characters from both strings, and then computes the fraction of common characters between the two strings. 

The problem is that the specification is asking for "the same characters" which can be interpreted differently. For example, case sensitivity might be an issue here - the provided solutions don't account for it, but acCount and acCount would fail since they have different cases in the first character. This is arguably a trivia aspect, so the solution might be generalized to that.

Here is a test suite that can be used to validate the function:
```python
test_cases = [
    ("eabcdzzzz", "dddzzzzzzzddeddabc", True),
    ("abcd", "dddddddabc", True),
    ("dddddddabc", "abcd", True),
    ("eabcd", "dddddddabc", False),
    ("abcd", "dddddddabce", False),
    ("eabcdzzzz", "dddzzzzzzzddddabc", False)
]

for s0, s1, expected in test_cases:
    result = same_chars(s0, s1)
    assert result == expected
```

This test suite contains a variety of test cases, including edge cases, to ensure the function behaves correctly under different scenarios.
