```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return sorted(s0) == sorted(s1)
```

The `same_chars` function uses sorting to ensure that the characters in two strings are compared in the same order. This approach allows the function to accurately determine if the characters are the same, regardless of their original order. In scenarios where character ordering matters, this function provides a concise solution.

This function's ability to identify strings with the same characters but different arrangements adds versatility to your coding toolkit, proving invaluable when addressing character-based challenges.
