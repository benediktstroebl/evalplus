Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return len(set(s0) & set(s1)) / min(len(s0), len(s1)) > 0.6
```
The function works by comparing the unique characters in both strings and then calculating the fraction of matching characters between the two strings. If this fraction exceeds 0.6, the function returns True, indicating that the strings share a majority of characters and are likely the same. Otherwise, it returns False.

You can use this function to test the similarity of two strings using the provided tests or new strings of your choice. Just call the `same_chars()` function with two string arguments and it will return True if the strings are considered similar and False otherwise. Feel free to ask any more questions or request further assistance on this or any other topic related to Python or coding!
