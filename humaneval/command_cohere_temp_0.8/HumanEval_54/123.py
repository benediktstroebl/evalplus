```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return len(set(s0) & set(s1)) / min(len(s0), len(s1)) > 0.6
```

The function employs the "Jaccard Index" to efficiently determine whether two strings share a majority of characters.

This approach leverages the shared characters between the two strings while mitigating the impact of their differing characters. This provides a clearer signal for whether the strings are akin.

Here is a test suite for the function:
```python
def test_same_chars():
    assert same_chars("eabcdzzzz", "dddzzzzzzzddeddabc")
    assert same_chars("abcd", "dddddddabc")
    assert same_chars("dddddddabc", "abcd")
    assert not same_chars("eabcd", "dddddddabc")
    assert not same_chars("abcd", "dddddddabce")
    assert not same_chars("eabcdzzzz", "dddzzzzzzzddddabc")
```

Ensure you are using Python 3.6 or higher to run tests and execute code, as the use of the ` `/ `min` ratio is extant in this version. If you work with an earlier Python version, consider utilizing the ` `max` ` function as a substitute. 
```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return len(set(s0) & set(s1)) / max(len(s0), len(s1)) > 0.6
```
