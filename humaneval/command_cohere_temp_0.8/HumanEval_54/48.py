Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return len(set(s0) & set(s1)) / min(len(s0), len(s1)) > 0.6
```
This function works by comparing the unique characters in both strings and then calculating the percentage of common characters between them. If this percentage is greater than 0.6, the function returns `True`, indicating that the two words have largely the same characters. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Here's how you can use it in the context of a markdown code block:
```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return len(set(s0) & set(s1)) / min(len(s0), len(s1)) > 0.6

# Test cases
assert same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc')
assert same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabc')
assert same_chars('dddddddabc', 'abcd')
assert not same_chars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc')
assert not same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabce')
assert not same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddddabc')
```
You can copy and paste this code block to test the function with different input scenarios. 
Please note that this is just one possible implementation, and there might be other approaches to solving this problem. 
Feel free to customize and expand on this code block further according to your needs.
