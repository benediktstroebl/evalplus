Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return len(set(s0) & set(s1)) / max(len(s0), len(s1)) > 0.5
```
This problem can be solved by calculating the Jaccard Index of the two strings and comparing it to 0.5. The Jaccard Index is defined as the ratio of the number of characters the two strings have in common to the total number of characters in the intersection of the two strings. The function outputs True if the Jaccard Index is greater than 0.5, otherwise False. This method allows for concise code that solves the problem and addresses the given test cases. 
The code could be improved with the following: 
1. Adding type annotations: This would make the code more readable and provide better documentation.
2. Adding comments: This would further improve the readability and understandability of the code. 
3. Incorporating input validation: This is to ensure that the inputs are two strings, which is the intended input for the function. 
4. Including a comprehensive test suite: This would cover a variety of scenarios, including various string lengths, character types, and similarities. 
5. Considering performance optimizations: This is especially relevant when dealing with very large strings, where optimization techniques may improve performance. 
6. Considering error handling: This would be implemented to handle any edge cases or unexpected inputs that may cause errors, such as non-string inputs. 
7. Applying coding conventions: This consistency in code style could make the code more readable and easier to collaborate on. 
However, these are suggestions and may not be necessary or applicable depending on the context of the code's use.
