Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return len(set(s0) & set(s1)) / min(len(s0), len(s1)) > 0.6
```
The function compares two input strings s0 and s1. It calculates the shared character set between them using the & operator, and then divides the length of this shared character set by the shorter length of the two strings. If this ratio is greater than 0.6, it returns True, indicating that the two strings have a large proportion of identical characters. Otherwise, it returns False.
