Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return len(set(s0) & set(s1)) / max(len(s0), len(s1)) > 0.5
```
This function uses set theory and the proportion of the intersection of characters to efficiently determine if two strings have the same characters or not.
