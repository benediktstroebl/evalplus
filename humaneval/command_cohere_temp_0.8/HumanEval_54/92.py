Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return sorted(s0) == sorted(s1)
```
The function `same_chars(s0, s1)` checks if two strings have the same characters independent of their original order. It achieves this by sorting both strings, comparing them, and returning `True` if they are equal after sorting, or `False` otherwise. 

The intended behavior for edge cases is:
- `True`: `[], '', 'aaaa', 'aaaaaaaaaaa'`.
- `False`: `['a'], ['aa'], ['aaa'], ['aaaa'], ['baaaa'], ['aaaaa']`.

The code is not optimized for performance nor is it intended to be. It is simple, clear, and straightforward to understand. If efficiency is required, alternative algorithms can be considered. 

The code includes no comments, badges, or other annotations, as it is intended to be standalone and self-contained. If you require any additional information, clarification, or explanation, please don't hesitate to ask.
