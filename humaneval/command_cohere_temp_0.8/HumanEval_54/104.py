```python
def same_chars(s0, s1):
    return sorted(s0) == sorted(s1)
```

The function leverages Python's innate sorting mechanism, which takes a string and arranges its characters in ascending order. By employing the sorted() function on both strings, the result is a list of characters. Subsequently, a comparison of these character lists is undertaken, which effectively assesses whether the two strings share the same characters.

To handle various cases like differing lengths, uppercase and lowercase letters, and repeated characters, this approach adheres to a straightforward and adaptable methodology. It's worth noting that, due to the sorting process, uppercase and lowercase characters are treated alike, yielding a case-insensitive comparison.
