    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

This Python script defines a function `file_name_check` that takes a `file_name` as input and returns either "Yes" or "No" depending on the conditions mentioned in the problem. The following conditions are checked:
1. The length of any continuous sequence of digits in the `file_name` should not exceed 3. This is checked using a sum function that calculates the number of digits and compares it to 3.
2. The `file_name` should contain exactly one dot ('.'). This is checked using the in operator.
3. The part of the `file_name` before the dot should start with a letter of the Latin alphabet. This is checked using the `startswith` function.
4. The part of the `file_name` after the dot should be among the list ["txt", "exe", "dll"]. This is checked using the in operator.

In all other cases, the function returns "Yes" if the filename meets the specified criteria and "No" if it does not.

The script passes the test cases provided in the problem and should be able to handle any other input file name as long as they are valid string values. 
It is also worth noting that the stopwords "Yes" and "No" can be changed to anything else without affecting the functionality of the script, for more readability, flexibility or conformity with other scripts, for instance, you could use "Valid!" and "Invalid!" instead.
