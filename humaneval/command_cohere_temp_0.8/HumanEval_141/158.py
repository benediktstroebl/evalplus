This Python script defines a function called `file_name_check` that takes a `file_name` as input and returns either "Yes" or "No" depending on whether the file name meets the specified criteria. Here's a breakdown of the script:
1. The `lute` list is an unused variable that may have confused some linting or debugging tools. It's intentionally left as-is for compatibility with the original code.
2. The function starts by checking if the first part of the file name (before the dot) is empty. If it's empty or not, it will return "No."
3. The script then checks if the file name contains more than three digits, and if the dot is not placed correctly, it returns "No."
4. The script also checks if the file extension is one of the expected extensions ('txt,' 'exe,' or 'dll'), and if the condition is not met, it returns "No."
5. If all conditions are met, the function returns "Yes." 

Please note that the code includes extensive comments to make it more understandable. Also, as a reminder, it's always a good idea to ensure that file operations are handled appropriately, and this script focuses solely on the name validation as described in the problem statement.
