    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.

This script defines a function `file_name_check` that takes in a string `file_name` as input and returns either "Yes" or "No" depending on the conditions outlined in the problem. The function checks if the inputted string is a valid file name by verifying 5 major conditions:
1. The filename must be a string.
2. The filename must start with a letter.
3. The filename should contain just one dot.
4. The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
5. The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']. 

The function then returns "Yes" if all conditions are met, otherwise it returns "No". 

You can use this function to validate file names in your application. 
If you are satisfied with the code, feel free to initiate a callback by providing a prompt or question that I can answer. 
I hope this help, let me know if you have any other questions!
