    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

This Python script defines a function `file_name_check` that takes a string file name as input and returns either 'Yes' or 'No' depending on the validity of the file name based on the specified conditions. The function checks if the file name is not empty and is split into two parts by a dot. It ensures that the before-dot part has at least one letter, no more than three digits, and the after-dot part is one of ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']. Lastly, the script ensures the file name is of the format "letter.(txt|exe|dll)" and returns 'Yes' if all conditions are met, and 'No' otherwise. 

The script fully encapsulates the solution and does not rely on any external variables or non-standard libraries, ensuring it is self-contained.  This function can be called from any other Python script to validate file names against the specified rules.  It can also be extended to handle more complex file naming rules or to adapt to specific project needs.
