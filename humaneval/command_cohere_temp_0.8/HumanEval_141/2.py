    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'

This Python script defines a function called `file_name_check` that takes a single argument, `file_name`, which is a string that represents the name of a file. 

The function returns `'Yes'` if the specified file name is valid, and `'No'` otherwise. 

The function checks the following conditions to determine if the file name is valid:
1. The length of the entire file name is not 0 (`not empty`).
2. The file name contains exactly one dot (`'.'`).
3. The substring before the dot (the file extension) has a maximum length of 3 digits.
4. The substring before the dot starts with a letter of the Latin alphabet.
5. The substring after the dot is either `'txt'`, `'exe'`, or `'dll'`.

The function returns `'Yes'` only if all these conditions are met. 

The function also includes some basic type checking, and returns `'No'` if the input is empty or not a string. 

You can test this function by calling it with different file names and checking the returned result. 

Let me know if you have any questions or if I can further optimize the solution!
