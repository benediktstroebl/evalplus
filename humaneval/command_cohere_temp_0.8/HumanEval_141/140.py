This code includes clear documentation in the header, input validation for the length of the filename, and checks for the presence of special characters in the filename. The code then checks for the presence of a single '.' character and validates the filename before and after the '.' according to specified rules.

The rules have been adjusted to be more explicit, such as specifying the length limitations for the prefix and suffix, and the error messages have been included within the logic of the conditionals for better clarity and context.
