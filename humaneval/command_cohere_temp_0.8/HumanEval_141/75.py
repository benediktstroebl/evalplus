```python
def file_name_check(file_name):
    checks = [lambda: len(set(char for char in file_name if char.isdigit())) <= 3,
             lambda: '.' in file_name,
             lambda: file_name.split('.')[0][0].isalpha(),
             lambda: file_name.split('.')[1] in ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']]
    return 'Yes' if all(check() for check in checks) else 'No'
```

The given Python script defines a function `file_name_check` that takes a `file_name` as input, containing several conditions that the file name must satisfy in order for it to be considered valid. The conditions are embedded in the code using lambda functions, each one checking a specific rule, such as the number of digits in the file name, the presence of a dot, the validity of the prefix, and the type of file specified in the postfix. The function applies a filter using the `all` function, which returns `True` only if all the conditions are satisfied, and `False` otherwise. If all conditions hold, the function returns "Yes," indicating that the file name is valid, otherwise, it returns "No," indicating that the file name does not meet the specified criteria.

The approach allows for a concise and structured validation procedure, ensuring the file name's conformity to the stipulated rules. While this code is concise and well-structured, it's always a good idea to include comments to improve code readability and make it easier for others (or future you) to understand the code.  You might consider adding comments to briefly describe each condition's function to enhance clarity and maintainability.
