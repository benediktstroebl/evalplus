    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'

    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

This Python script defines a function called `file_name_check` that takes a string representing a file's name as input. It checks for the validity of the file name based on several conditions outlined in the problem statement. The function evaluates if the file name contains exactly one dot `.`, and if the substring before and after the dot meets specific requirements. The function returns "Yes" if the file name is valid, and "No" otherwise. Additionally, the script includes examples of function calls to demonstrate the behavior for different cases. 

The script thoroughly checks the file name using various conditions, ensuring the name is valid according to the provided criteria. This approach ensures that the file name is correctly verified against the specified requirements, allowing for accurate validation of file names in accordance with the problem statement.

This effectively validates file names against the specified conditions, ensuring they start with a letter, have a single dot, and their extensions are among "txt," "exe," or "dll."
