    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'

    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

This Python script defines a function called `file_name_check` that takes a single argument, `file_name`, which is a string representing the name of a file. It checks the following conditions to determine if the file name is valid or not:
1. The file name is not an empty string or not a string.
2. The file name contains exactly one dot ('.').
3. The part of the file name before the dot ('.') is not empty and starts with a letter (lowercase or uppercase).
4. The part of the file name after the dot is one of the specific strings: 'txt', 'exe', or 'dll'.
5. There are not more than three digits (0-9) in the file name.

The function returns "Yes" if all the conditions are met, meaning that the file name is valid. Otherwise, it returns "No". 

The function also provides informative messages when returning the "No" response, specifying which condition(s) the file name failed to satisfy. 

This enhances user understanding when the function is used in reality. 

You can use this function to validate file names in your application and ensure they meet the specified criteria. 
This Python script defines a function called `file_name_check` that takes a string `file_name` as input and returns either 'Yes' or 'No' depending on whether the provided file name meets a set of predetermined conditions. The function is designed to check the validity of file names in terms of these specific conditions.
