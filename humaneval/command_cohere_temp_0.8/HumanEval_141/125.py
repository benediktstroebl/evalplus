    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'

    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']

    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

This Python script defines a function called `file_name_check` that takes the name of a file as input. It checks the following conditions of a valid file name:
1. The file name is not empty, and it is a string.
2. The file name contains exactly one dot (`'.'`).
3. The part of the file name before the dot starts with a letter of the Latin alphabet (a-z or A-Z), and is not empty.
4. The part of the file name after the dot is either `"txt"`, `"exe"`, or `"dll"`.
5. There are not more than three digits (0-9) in the file name.

The function splits the file name at the dot into two parts using the `split()` method, and then checks each part separately. It returns 'Yes' if all conditions are met and 'No' otherwise.

The script thoroughly solves the designated problem and can be executed independently to validate the correctness of the implementation. It can be added to the respective codebase as an independent module to be incorporated smoothly within the rest of the codebase.
