```python

    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

    if not file_name or not isinstance(file_name, str):

This Python script defines a function called `file_name_check` that takes the name of a file as input. It checks the following conditions of a valid file name:
1. The file name is not empty and contains exactly one dot (.).
2. The substring before the dot contains only letters and has a maximum length of 3.
3. The substring after the dot is either "txt", "exe", or "dll".

The function splits the file name at the dot and checks each condition. If all conditions are met, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".

The rest of the script is an example usage of the `file_name_check` function with test cases to demonstrate how it passes and fails certain conditions that are mentioned in the problem statement.

This solution satisfies the requirement for a self-contained Python script that solves the problem provided in the code block.
