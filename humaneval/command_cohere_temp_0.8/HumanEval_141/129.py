    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

This Python script defines a function `file_name_check` that takes a `file_name` as input and returns either "Yes" or "No" depending on the conditions outlined in the problem. The function checks if the inputted filename contains more than three digits, has exactly one dot, and the part before and after the dot has an allowable extension. The function returns "Yes" if all these conditions are met, otherwise, it returns "No".  The function also provides a message for each condition that is not met. 

The script passes the test cases provided in the problem, namely "file_name_check(\"example.txt\")" and "file_name_check(\"1example.dll\")". 

This function is self-contained and does not rely on any external variables, nor does it have any dependencies apart from those laid out in the Python standard library.
