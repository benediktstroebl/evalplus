    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

This Python script defines a function `file_name_check` that takes a single argument, `file_name`, which is the name of a file. The function checks the following four conditions:
1. The file name is not empty and is a string.
2. The file name starts with a letter between 'a' and 'z' or between 'A' and 'Z'.
3. The file name contains exactly one dot '.'.
4. The substring after the dot has a length of 3 or less, and it is either "txt", "exe", or "dll".
If all conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes', meaning the file name is valid. If any of the conditions are not met, the function returns 'No', meaning the file name is not valid. 

The function returns 'No' if the file name does not start with a letter (condition 2) or does not have exactly one dot (condition 3). It also returns 'No' if the substring after the dot has more than three characters (condition 4) or is not one of the allowed extensions (txt, exe, or dll). 

Overall, this Python function checks the validity of a file name according to the given conditions set in the markdown code block. 
It returns 'Yes' if the file name is valid and 'No' if it is not. 
The function ensures consistency and flexibility in checking different scenarios of file naming.
