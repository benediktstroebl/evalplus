    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'

    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

This Python script defines a function `file_name_check` that takes a `file_name` as input and checks for a list of requirements that qualify a file name as valid or not. The function returns "Yes" if the file name is valid, and "No" otherwise. 

The following are the checks that the function conducts:
1. There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
2. The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
3. The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
4. The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']

The function then uses the following regex search methods to complete the checks:
- `re.search(r'\d{4,}', file_name)` searches for a pattern of 4 or more digits in the file name, and returns a match object if it is found.
- `".".join(file_name.split(".")[-2:]) == file_name` checks if there is exactly one dot in the file name by ensuring that the file name minus the extension (the part after the second-to-last dot) joined with a dot equals the original file name.
- `not file_name.split(".")[1]` checks if the substring after the dot is empty.
- `file_extension not in ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']` checks if
