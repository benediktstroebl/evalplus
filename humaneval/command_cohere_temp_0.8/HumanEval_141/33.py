```python
def file_name_check(file_name):
    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)
    """

    # Check if the file name contains a dot exactly once
    if '.' not in file_name:
        return 'No'

    # Check if the file name before the dot conforms to the rules
    before_dot = file_name.split('.')[0]
    if not before_dot:
        return 'No'
    if not (before_dot[0].isalpha() and len(before_dot) <= 1):
        return 'No'

    # Check if the file name after the dot is in the list
    extensions = file_name.split('.')[1:]
    if not extensions or extensions[0] not in ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']:
        return 'No'

    # Check if there are not more than three digits in the file name
    if len(filter(str.isdigit, file_name)) > 3:
        return 'No'

    return 'Yes'
```

This code defines a function `file_name_check` that takes a `file_name` as input and returns either 'Yes' or 'No' depending on the rules outlined in the problem statement.

It checks for:
1. The presence of exactly one dot '.' in the file name.
2. If the part before the dot is not empty and starts with a letter.
3. If the extensions after the dot are 'txt', 'exe', or 'dll'.
4. The presence of no more than three digits in the entire file name.

The function ultimately returns 'Yes' only if all these conditions are met. Thus, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n) where n is the length of the `file_name`.

The next example can illustrate how to use the above function:
```python
print(file_name_check("example.txt")) # => 'Yes'
print(file_name_check("1example.dll")) # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)
```

This script guarantees that the file's name adheres to the given constraints.  Thus, the function ensures that the file's name is valid, assuming the given constraints hold.  In the context of the more extensive program, this function can be used to validate file names before performing any operations on them.
