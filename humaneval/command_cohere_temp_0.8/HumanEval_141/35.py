```python
def file_name_check(file_name):
    checker = lambda s: len(s) > 0 and s[0].isalpha() and s.count('.') == 1 and \
                   sum(d in s for d in '0123456789') <= 3 and \
                   (s.split('.')[1:] == ['txt', 'exe', 'dll'] or s.split('.')[1:] == [''])
  
    return 'Yes' if checker(file_name) else 'No'
```
This Python script defines a function called `file_name_check` that takes in a string representing a file name as input. It checks for the validity of the file name based on several conditions outlined in the problem statement.

The function uses a lambda function, `checker`, to evaluate the conditions:
1. The length of the string must be greater than 0, ensuring it's not an empty string.
2. The first character must be a letter, ensuring the file name starts with a letter from the Latin alphabet.
3. The string must contain exactly one dot ('.'), which is used to separate the file extension.
4. The number of digits in the string must not exceed three, ensuring there are no more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
5. The file extension must be one of ['txt', 'exe', 'dll'] or an empty list [''], which checks that the substring after the dot is valid.

The lambda function returns 'True' if all conditions are met and 'False' if any condition is not met. The `file_name_check` function uses this lambda function to evaluate the conditions and returns 'Yes' if the file name is valid and 'No' otherwise.

The script ensures that all the specified conditions are correctly evaluated using lambda without the need for explicitly defining separate functions for each condition. Hence, the approach is both concise and effective in solving the problem.
