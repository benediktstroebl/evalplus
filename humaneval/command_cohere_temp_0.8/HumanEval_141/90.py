    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

This Python script defines a function called `file_name_check` that takes a single argument, `file_name`, which is a string that represents the name of a file. 

The function returns 'Yes' if the given file name follows a specific set of rules, and 'No' otherwise. 

The rules are:
1. The file name should not be empty.
2. The file name should contain exactly one dot ('.').
3. The part of the file name before the dot should start with a letter of the Latin alphabet (a to z or A to Z), and should not be empty.
4. The part of the file name after the dot should be one of the following: 'txt', 'exe', or 'dll'.
5. The total number of digits (0 to 9) in the file name should not exceed three.

The function checks the given file name against these rules, and returns the appropriate response 'Yes' or 'No'. 

It also has basic input validation to ensure the input is a string and not empty.

This solution covers many edge cases and provides a clear and concise function to check file name validity based on the given criteria. 

It can be used directly in code to validate file names or used as a starting point to further customize validations for specific use cases. 

It will fail if the input is not a string or is an empty string, which are corner cases included in the problem statement.
