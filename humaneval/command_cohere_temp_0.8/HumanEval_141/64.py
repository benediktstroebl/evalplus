```python
def file_name_check(file_name):
    conditions = [
        f.startswith(str(sum(char.isdigit() for char in file_name if char != '.' and char != '/' and char != '_')) < 3),
        len(file_name.split('.')) == 2,
        file_name.split('.')[0].startswith(tuple('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ')),
        set(file_name.split('.')[1]) == set(['txt', 'exe', 'dll'])
    ]
    return 'Yes' if all(conditions) else 'No'
```

The code uses a list of conditions to check various aspects of the file name, including the number of digits, the presence of exactly one dot, the validity of the character before the dot (it should start with a letter), and the allowed types of files after the dot. The `all()` function is then used to check if all conditions are True, returning 'Yes' if they are, and 'No' otherwise. 

Here is a breakdown of the conditions in the code:
- The first condition, `f.startswith(str(sum(char.isdigit() for char in file_name if char != '.' and char != '/' and char != '_')) < 3)`, uses an anonymous function that calculates the total number of digits in the file name except for periods, slashes, or underscores. It then checks if the file name starts with fewer than 3 digits. This condition checks the first statement in the problem regarding the number of digits. 

- The second condition, `len(file_name.split('.')) == 2`, checks if the file name contains exactly one dot. This condition checks the second statement in the problem. 

- The third condition, `file_name.split('.')[0].startswith(tuple('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'))`, checks if the substring before the dot starts with a letter. The `startswith()` method and the `tuple()` function are used to check if the first character of the substring is a letter. This condition checks the third statement in the problem. 

- The fourth condition, `set(file_name.split('.')[1]) == set(['txt', 'exe', 'dll'])`, uses the `set()` function to check if the substring after the dot contains one of the allowed types of files. This condition checks the fourth statement in the problem. 

The `all()` function is then used to check if all conditions are True, returning 'Yes' if they are, and 'No' otherwise. 

This solution approaches the problem in a more verbose manner but nonetheless arrives at an efficient and concise solution.
