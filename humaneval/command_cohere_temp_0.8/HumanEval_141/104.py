```python

    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

This Python script defines a function `file_name_check` that takes the file name as input and returns 'Yes' if the name is valid. The script includes a robust series of conditions and checks to ensure:
1. The file name is not empty, and it starts with a letter.
2. There are no more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
3. The file's name contains exactly one dot '.' 
4. The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll'] 

The function checks each condition, and if all criteria are met, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

This solution aims to provide a clear and concise explanation of the code, and it should help you understand the logic and requirements of the problem and the corresponding code. 

You can modify the code to include more tests to enhance the solution's robustness and coverage.
