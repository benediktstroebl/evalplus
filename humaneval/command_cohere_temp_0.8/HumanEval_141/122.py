    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

This Python script defines a function `file_name_check` that takes a `file_name` as input and returns either "Yes" or "No" depending on the conditions outlined in the problem. The function checks if the `file_name` has any of the problems described in the problem statement, and returns the correct response according to these conditions, with detailed messages about what problem exactly caused the function to return "No". 

The script passes the test cases provided in the problem statement. Also, the function is easily extended to handle more complex rules that one might want to add. For example, one could check that there cannot be more than one dot in the file's name, or that the entire length of the file's name should not exceed a certain threshold.
