```python
def file_name_check(file_name):
    dots = file_name.count('.')
    if dots != 1:
        return "No"
    pre, ext = file_name.split('.')
    if len(pre) == 0 or not pre[0].isalpha():
        return "No"
    if len(ext) > 3 or not ext.isalpha():
        return "No"
    ext = ext.lower()
    if ext not in ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']:
        return "No"
    return "Yes"
```

The code divides the given file name into its prefix and extension using the split() method. The prefix is checked against emptiness, and the first character being a letter. The extension is checked to ensure it is no longer than 3 characters, that the first character is alphabetic, and that it ends in ".txt", ".exe", or ".dll". The function returns "Yes" in all valid conditions and "No" in any invalid conditions. 

Would you like to test this code? Hit the 'REPLACE CODE WITH TESTS' button to generate a set of test cases, and see if the function's outputs match the expected outputs. Any incorrect outputs will be highlighted, and you can update the code accordingly until the passed tests confirm that the code produces the expected outputs for each test case.
