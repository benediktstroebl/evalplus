    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.

This Python script defines a function called `file_name_check` that takes a single argument, `file_name`, which is a string that represents the name of a file. This function returns the string "Yes" if the specified file name is valid and the string "No" otherwise. 

The function checks the following conditions of the file name:
1. The file name is not empty and contains exactly one dot ('.').
2. The substring before the dot (the file extension) has a maximum length of 3 characters and starts with a letter (lowercase or uppercase).
3. The substring after the dot is either "txt", "exe", or "dll". 

The function returns "Yes" if all conditions are met, and "No" otherwise. You can use this function to validate file names in your application.  It can be used to validate file names before proceeding with operations such as saving or uploading files, ensuring that the file names meet specific criteria for consistency and security.  It's always good to have inline documentation like the docstring to briefly explain the purpose of the function and the expected input so other users can understand your code easily.  This makes the code more maintainable and readable.  It also helps to follow best practices in coding, such as using exhaustive tests for validation to cover all possible edges and making sure that the code has good performance against all possible edge cases that might arise.  This will result in robust code that is reliable and trustable.  Thanks to these practices, the code will also be more scalable and easier to maintain and update over time.  Finally, following these guidelines will also make the coding process more efficient, thus reducing the time and effort needed to develop your applications and services.  As a result, you can deliver more value to your users and stakeholders in a timely manner and within budget.  All of these guidelines will also contribute to improving the developer experience when working on the project, making it more enjoyable and fun, which is a key factor in job satisfaction and retention.  All of these guidelines are industry-standard best practices when it comes
