    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

This Python script defines a function called `file_name_check` that takes a single argument, `file_name`, which is the name of a file. The function evaluates the validity of the given file name based on a set of criteria and returns either 'Yes' or 'No' depending on whether the file name meets these criteria. 

The criteria are that there should be no more than three digits in the file's name, there should be exactly one dot ('.') in the file's name, the substring before the dot should not be empty and it should start with a letter (lowercase or uppercase), and the substring after the dot should be one of the following: 'txt', 'exe', or 'dll'. 

The function checks the file name against these criteria and returns 'Yes' if all of the criteria are met, and 'No' otherwise. You can use this function to quickly check if a file name is valid or not in a script or application.  It will help to ensure that the file names adhere to a consistent and appropriate format, which can help to avoid errors and confusion in file management systems.  This is particularly important in large coding projects or if you are sharing files with other users or programs.
