    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'

    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

This code solves the problem statement by checking the validity of a file name as per the conditions mentioned in the problem statement. The function checks for the following conditions:
1. Maximum of three digits in the file name.
2. Exactly one dot ('.') in the file name.
3. The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it should start with a letter.
4. The substring after the dot should be either 'txt', 'exe', or 'dll'.
5. The file name should not have more than 100 characters.

The function returns "Yes" if all the conditions are met, and "No" otherwise. Also, if any other error occurs (like the file name not being a string, or not having a length of more than 100 characters), an appropriate message is returned.

This code should be placed in a Python file (e.g., `filename_checker.py`) and imported to be used, or alternatively, you can copy and paste the code into your script and run it directly. The active code block should not contain any leading or trailing white spaces, and there should preferably be no unnecessary newlines or blank lines to ensure the best chance of compatibility across different environments. 

Please let me know if you would like to check the validity of other types of file names or if you have any other queries pertaining to this problem or any other topic!
