This Python script defines a function `file_name_check` that takes a string `file_name` as input and returns either "Yes" or "No" depending on the conditions outlined in the problem. The function checks if the file name contains exactly one period (".") and meets the following conditions:
- The part of the file name before the period should start with a letter of the Latin alphabet.
- The part after the period should be either "txt", "exe", or "dll".
- There should be no more than three digits in the file name.

The function splits the input file name using the period as the separator, and then checks each part against the specified conditions. Finally, the script contains corresponding examples in the comments to explain the working of the code. 

Let's break down the solution step by step and explain each part:
1. The first conditional check is `if not file_name or not isinstance(file_name, str):`. This checks if the input is provided and if it is a string. If these conditions are not met, it returns "No" because the file name criteria is not satisfied.
2. The script splits the file name into its base and extension using the dot as the separator, `files = file_name.split(".")`. File paths can have multiple dots, so we use `split()` to ensure we only consider the last dot. The variable `files` is a list with two elements: the base (before the dot) and the extension (after the dot).
3. It then checks the base (the first element in the list) to ensure it is not empty and starts with a letter, `if files[0].strip() == "" or not files[0].strip().isalpha():`. The `strip()` method is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces from the string. The `is
