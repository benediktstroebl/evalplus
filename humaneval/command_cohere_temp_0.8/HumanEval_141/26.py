    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

This Python script defines a function called `file_name_check` that takes the name of a file as input. It checks the following conditions of a valid file name:
1. The file name is not empty and contains exactly one period (`.`).
2. The part of the file name before the period (`.`) starts with a letter and contains fewer than four digits.
3. The part of the file name after the period is either `txt`, `exe`, or `dll`. 

The function returns "Yes" if all conditions are met, meaning the file name is valid. Otherwise, it returns "No." 

The function also provides informative return values for edge cases, returning "No" if the file name is empty or non-string. With this function, you can now verify the validity of a file name effortlessly. You can call this function and pass in different file names to get the validity results. For example:
```python
print(file_name_check("example.txt"))  # Outputs: 'Yes'
print(file_name_check("1example.dll"))  # Outputs: 'No'
``` 

This script provides a concise and effective way to validate file names' conformity to specific rules, aiding in ensuring naming consistency and assisting in debugging and file organization.
