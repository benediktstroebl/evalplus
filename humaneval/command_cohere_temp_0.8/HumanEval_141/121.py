    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

This Python script defines a function `file_name_check` that takes a `file_name` as input and returns either "Yes" or "No" depending on the conditions outlined in the problem. The function checks if the file name contains exactly one dot, the substring before the dot starts with a letter and is not empty, the substring after the dot is either "txt", "exe", or "dll", and there are not more than three digits in the file name.

The script passes the test cases provided in the problem and returns the expected outputs. Feel free to adapt this code to your needs! Let me know if you would like to have anything else added to this solution.
