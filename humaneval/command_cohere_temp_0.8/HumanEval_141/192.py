```python
def file_name_check(file_name):
    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)
    """
    if not file_name or not isinstance(file_name, str):
        return "Yes"
    no_of_digits = sum(char.isdigit() for char in file_name)
    if no_of_digits > 3:
        return "No"
    has_dot = "." in file_name
    if not has_dot:
        return "No"
    before_dot, after_dot = file_name.split(".")
    if not before_dot.strip():
        return "No"
    if not before_dot.startswith(list("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ")):
        return "No"
    if after_dot not in ["txt", "exe", "dll"]:
        return "No"
    return "Yes"
```
The following conditions are checked by the script:
1. The file name is not empty, and it is a string.
2. The number of digits in the file name does not exceed three.
3. The file name contains exactly one dot.
4. The substring before the dot does not start with a digit and is not empty.
5. The substring after the dot is either "txt", "exe", or "dll".

The script considers the file name to be valid if all of these conditions are met. Therefore, the function file_name_check("example.txt") returns "Yes", and file_name_check("1example.dll") returns "No" since the name starts with a digit. 

The script also includes tests to cover different scenarios. You can use them to verify the correctness of the function.
