    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.

This code block defines a function called `file_name_check` that takes a single argument, `file_name`, representing a string of a file's name. It returns either the string 'Yes' or 'No' depending on whether the file's name satisfies a set of predetermined conditions. These conditions are that there should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name; the file's name should contain exactly one dot ('#'); the substring before the dot should not be empty and start with a letter from the Latin alphabet; and the substring after the dot should be one of ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']. The function returns 'Yes' if all conditions are met, and 'No' otherwise. Additionally, if the input `file_name` is not a string or is empty, the function returns an appropriate message indicating the specific issue. 

The script includes basic input validation to ensure that the `file_name` input is a string and is not empty, returning the relevant error message if it is. It counts the number of digits and dot characters in the `file_name`, ensuring there's only one dot and no more than three digits. It also checks if the name before the dot is an empty string or doesn't start with a letter, and if the extension is not one of the allowed ones
