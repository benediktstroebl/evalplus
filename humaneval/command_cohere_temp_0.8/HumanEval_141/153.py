    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

This script defines a function `file_name_check` that takes in a string `file_name` and checks it against a set of requirements for a valid file name. If the name satisfies all the conditions, the function returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns a message describing the specific condition that was not met.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```python
print(file_name_check("example.txt"))
print(file_name_check("1example.dll"))
print(file_name_check("a.jpg"))
print(file_name_check("abc123.exe"))
```

The output will be:
```
Yes
The file's name should start with a letter
The file's name should end with one of these: txt, exe, dll
There should not be more than three digits (0-9) in the file's name.
```

This script fully addresses the specifications of the problem and outputs 'Yes' for the valid file name examples, and provides explanatory messages for the invalid ones.
