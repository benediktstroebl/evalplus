The function `file_name_check` takes a `file_name` argument and checks it against a series of conditions. If all conditions are met, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".

Here is a breakdown of the conditions:
- `if file_name.count(".")`: This checks if the file name has exactly one dot.
- `if file_name[-1] == ".":` This checks if the file name ends with a dot.
- `if file_name.isalpha()`: This checks if the file name consists only of letters and the dot.
- `if len(file_name) > 3 and file_name[0].isalpha()`: This checks if the file name is at least 4 characters long, with the first character being a letter, but allowing for the possibility of additional characters.
- `if file_name.count(".")`: This checks if there is exactly one dot, as ensured by the previous conditions.
- `if file_name.split(".")[1] in ["txt", "exe", "dll"]`: This checks if the file name follows the pattern "letter.[txt|exe|dll]", where letter represents the first character (which is guaranteed to be a letter due to previous checks).

Please note that this code assumes that the file name contains only letters, digits, and dots as allowed by the problem statement. It also assumes that the file name is at least 4 characters long, with the first character being a letter, but allows for the possibility of additional characters after the first letter. 

The code is structured to be succinct and precise while ensuring the validity of file names according to the provided specifications.
