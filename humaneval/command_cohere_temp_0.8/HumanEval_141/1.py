    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

This Python script defines a function called `file_name_check` that takes the name of a file as input. It checks the following conditions of a valid file name:
1. The file name contains exactly one dot ('.').
2. The part of the file name before the dot should start with a letter of the Latin alphabet and cannot be empty.
3. The part of the file name after the dot should be either 'txt', 'exe', or 'dll'.
4. There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.

The function splits the file name into its before- and after-dot parts using the `split()` method and checks the described conditions against these parts. Note that the script assumes that the input passed to the function is a string representing a file's name. The given example and test cases demonstrate how the function behaves for different inputs.

We can use this function to validate file names according to the specified rules by calling it and interpreting its output. For example:
```python
print(file_name_check("example.txt"))  # Outputs: 'Yes'
print(file_name_check("1example.dll"))  # Outputs: 'No'
``` 
This function can be used to validate file names before performing operations like copying, moving, or deleting files. You may modify it according to your specific needs, and if the input is not a string or the file name doesn't match the structure you want, you may consider using different methods to handle more complex scenarios.
