```python
def file_name_check(file_name):
    txt_dll_exe = ['txt', 'dll', 'exe']
    
    # Check if string contains more than 3 digits
    if len(set(char for char in file_name if char.isdigit())) > 3:
        return "No"
    
    # Check if the file name contains exactly one dot '.'
    if '.' not in file_name or file_name.count('.') > 1:
        return "No"
    
    # Check if the substring before the dot starts with a letter
    if not file_name.count('.') and not file_name.startswith(list('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ')):
        return "No"
    
    # Check if the substring after the dot is in txt_dll_exe
    if not file_name.count('.') and file_name.split('.')[-1].lower() not in txt_dll_exe:
        return "No"
    
    return "Yes"
```

This script defines a function `file_name_check` that takes in a `file_name` as a string and checks it against the specified conditions for a valid file name. If all conditions are met, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

This approach ensures that:
- There are not more than three digits in the file name.
- There is exactly one dot ('.') in the file name.
- The substring before the dot (everything before the first dot) starts with a letter and is not empty.
- The substring after the dot (everything after the first dot) is either 'txt', 'exe', or 'dll'. 

The function returns 'Yes' only if all these conditions are met.

This should accurately address the specified problem statement and corresponding tests. Let me know if you need anything else clarified or if you'd like to dive into any specific part of the solution.
