    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.

This Python script defines a function called `file_name_check` that takes the name of a file as input. It checks the following conditions to determine if the file name is valid or not:
- The file name should contain exactly one dot ('.').
- The substring before the dot should not be empty and it should start with a letter (uppercase or lowercase) from the Latin alphabet.
- The substring after the dot should be one of the following: 'txt', 'exe', or 'dll'.
- There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.

The function splits the file name into its preceding and succeeding substrings using the dot as delimiter, and proceeds to check each condition sequentially. 

The script passes the test cases provided in the prompt, namely, "file_name_check("example.txt")" returns "Yes", and "file_name_check("1example.dll")" returns "No". 

It also incorporates a safeguard by checking for empty file names or invalid string inputs, returning "No" in case these conditions are met. 

Furthermore, it checks the number of digits in the first substring of the file's name, returning "No" if there are more than three digits. 

The function returns "Yes" if all conditions are met, otherwise it returns "No".  This solution employs a concise and readable style, and offers remarks to clarify some of the considerations behind the code.
