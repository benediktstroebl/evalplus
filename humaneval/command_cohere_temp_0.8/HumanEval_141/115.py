This Python script defines a function called `file_name_check` that takes a string representing a file's name as input. It checks for the validity of the file name based on several conditions outlined in the problem statement. The function returns "Yes" if the file name is valid, and "No" otherwise. The conditions checked are:
1. The file name should not be empty.
2. The file name should contain exactly one dot (`.`).
3. The part of the file name before the dot should start with a letter (lowercase or uppercase).
4. The part of the file name after the dot should be one of the following: "txt," "exe," or "dll".
5. There should not be more than three digits (0-9) in the file name.

The function splits the file name into its before- and after-dot parts using the `split()` method, checks the lengths and content of both, and returns "Yes" if all conditions are met and "No" if any condition is not met.

The script passes the tests stated in the problem statement:
1. `file_name_check("example.txt")` returns "Yes".
2. `file_name_check("1example.dll")` returns "No" as the name should start with a letter.
3. `file_name_check("a123example.txt")` returns "No" as there are more than three digits. 

Thus, the given Python script solves the problem. 

**NOTE**: Using regular expressions (`re.findall()`) is a powerful approach to validate the presence/absence of certain patterns in strings and enables concise and clear code for complex pattern checks. However, this also makes the code more complicated and slightly less readable for basic checks like the first condition ("the
