    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'

    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

This Python script defines a function `file_name_check` that takes a string `file_name` as input and returns either 'Yes' or 'No' depending on whether the specified file name is valid or not. 

The script includes robust checks to validate the structure of the file name, such as:
1. **File Structure Check**: The function checks if the file name has a valid structure of "<prefix>.<extension)". If it doesn't have this structure, or if the prefix is empty, it returns 'No'.
2. **Prefix Check**: The function checks if the prefix (before the dot) starts with a letter (lowercase or uppercase), and that it contains no more than three characters. If the prefix fails either of these checks, the function returns 'No'.
3. **Extension Check**: The function checks if the extension (after the dot) is either 'txt', 'exe', or 'dll'. If the extension doesn't match these options, the function returns 'No'.

The function returns 'Yes' only when all the conditions are met, otherwise it returns 'No'.

The script thoroughly checks the given file name against the specified rules to determine if the file name is valid or not, making sure it conforms to the structure, prefix, and file extension requirements specified. 

This ensures that the file name is checked against all the specified conditions, and the result is correctly returned based on the outcome of these checks.
