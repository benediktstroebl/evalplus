    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

This Python script defines a function `file_name_check` that takes a `file_name` as input and returns either "Yes" or "No" depending on the conditions outlined in the problem. Here's how the script breaks down:
- The first conditional statement (`if not file_name or not isinstance(file_name, str):`) checks if the input is provided and if it is a string. If either condition is `False`, it returns "No" since the file name qualifications cannot be assessed.
- The next conditional statement (`if not file_name.startswith(tuple('abcde')):`) checks if the file name does not start with a letter, assuming it does not, it returns "No". 
- Thereafter, the script verifies if the file extension is valid through the statement (`if not file_name.split(".")[-1] in ["txt", "exe", "dll"]:`). If the file extension is not among the listed extensions, it returns "No". 
- The script also checks for the number of digits in the file name via `num_digits = sum(char.isdigit() for char in file_name)`. If there are more than three digits, it returns "No". 
- If none of these conditions are met, the function returns "Yes".

The script evaluates a file name based on the stated conditions and accordingly outputs either "Yes" or "No". 

This approach ensures the program thoroughly checks the various conditions before deciding if the file name is valid or not.
