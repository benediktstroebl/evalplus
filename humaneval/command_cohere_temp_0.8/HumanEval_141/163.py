    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'

    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

This Python script defines a function called `file_name_check` that takes the name of a file as input. It checks the validity of the file name based on several rules:
1. The function first ensures that the input is not empty and is a string. If it's not, the function immediately returns "No" since an empty or non-string input doesn't represent a valid file name.
2. The file name is then split into its base (before the dot) and extension (after the dot).
3. The base part of the file name should not be empty or start with a digit. It should consist of letters, possibly followed by letters or digits.
4. The extension part should be exactly three characters long and be one of the specific extensions ("txt", "exe", "dll").
5. The base part should not contain more than three digits.

If all these conditions are met, the file name is considered valid, and the function returns "Yes". If any of the conditions are not met, it returns "No".

The script thoroughly checks the input against these conditions, ensuring that the file name is valid before returning "Yes" and providing clear and concise explanations for each condition.
