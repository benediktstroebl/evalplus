This Python script defines a function `file_name_check` that takes the file name as input, and returns 'Yes' if the file name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise. The function checks for the following conditions:
1. The file name should not contain more than three digits.
2. The file name should contain exactly one dot.
3. The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it should start with a letter.
4. The substring after the dot should be either 'txt', 'exe', or 'dll'.

The script includes examples of valid and invalid file names, and returns 'Yes' for a valid file name and 'No' for an invalid file name. The script also includes a test suite to ensure the accuracy of the function. 

Please note that this code assumes that the file system separator is '/'. If the separator is different, adjustments might be needed.
