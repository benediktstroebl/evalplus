    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'

    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

This code block provides a Python function called `file_name_check` that evaluates the validity of a file name. It checks the name against specific criteria: the name should be under 10 characters, contain exactly one period, and have a non-empty prefix that starts with a letter. The function further verifies that the prefix contains 3 or fewer digits and that the suffix matches either 'txt', 'exe', or 'dll'. If the file name doesn't meet any of these conditions, the function returns 'No' along with an explanation; otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

The function utilizes built-in Python methods, such as `isdigit()`, `find()`, and `isalpha()`, to efficiently validate the file name. Overall, the code provides a definitive check for file name validity based on the specified criteria.
