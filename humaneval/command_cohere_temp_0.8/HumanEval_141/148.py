    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

This Python script defines a function called `file_name_check` that takes the name of a file as input. It checks the validity of the file name based on several rules:

1. The input must be a non-empty string.
2. It should contain exactly one dot (`.`).
3. The part before the dot should start with a letter (upper or lower case).
4. The part after the dot should be either "txt", "exe", or "dll".
5. There should not be more than three digits in the entire file name.

If the file name violates any of these rules, the function returns "No". Otherwise, it returns "Yes". 

This implementation follows the provided specification and includes a docstring for better understanding.  It can be improved by adding pre-commit hooks to ensure version control hygiene and adhering to PEP 8 style guidelines to enhance readability and maintainability. 

This code can be further extended to include additional validations or error handling to handle edge cases.
