```python
def file_name_check(file_name):
    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

This Python script defines a function `file_name_check` that takes a `file_name` as input and returns either "Yes" or "No" depending on the conditions outlined in the problem. The function checks if the `file_name` has any of the following issues: 

1. More than three digits.
2. Lacks a dot ('.') or has more than one dot.
3. A nonexistent or empty substring before the dot.
4. Does not have a substring after the dot among ["txt", "exe", "dll"].
5. Starts with a digit. 

The function returns "Yes" if the file name meets all of these conditions and "No" otherwise. You can use this function to validate file names in Python.  This code should be stored in a Python file (e.g., `filename_checker.py`) to be easily executable from any Python environment.  It could be run by importing the file (`import filename_checker`) or using the CLI (`python filename_checker.py`).  The chosen approach would depend on the specific context and requirements of the usage environment.
