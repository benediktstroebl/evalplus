    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

The function examines the provided file name according to the specified rules and returns either 'Yes' or 'No'. It also provides explanatory messages for when a file name is invalid and does not return the aforementioned response. You can add test cases to the function call to further ensure its robustness and handle edge cases.  This way, you can be certain that it covers all the cases mentioned in the problem statement.  Any file name that does not fulfill the conditions will return a message describing the issue.  This approach allows for easy debugging of any unexpected or invalid file names.  This function can be added to a broader script to ensure the validity of file names during the uploading or creation process, for example.  If this issue still needs to be solved, feel free to provide additional information. I am happy to assist you in reaching the solution.
