```python
def file_name_check(file_name):
    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

This Python script defines a function `file_name_check` that takes a string file name as input and returns either "Yes" or "No" depending on the validity of the file name. The function checks that the file name contains exactly one dot, that the substring before the dot starts with a letter and contains no more than three digits, and that the substring after the dot is either "txt", "exe", or "dll". The function returns "Yes" if all conditions are met, and "No" otherwise. An example usage of the function is shown in the comment above the function definition.  It addresses the conditions mentioned in the Issue like:
- The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
- The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
- The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
The provided examples in the Issue Statement are also correctly answered by this code.
