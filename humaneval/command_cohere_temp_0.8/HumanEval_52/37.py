```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This function uses the `all()` function to iterate over each element in the input list `l` and compare each element with the threshold value `t`. 
The result is a boolean value that indicates whether all the elements in the list are below the threshold, which corresponds to the documentation provided in the prompt. 
If you run this code, it will output: 
```bash
True
```
You can test the function by calling it with different lists and threshold values. For instance:
```python
print(below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100))
print(below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5))
``` 

This would yield the following output:
```bash
True
False
```

This demonstrates that the function correctly solves the problem and behaves as expected, as per the test cases provided in the initial prompt.
