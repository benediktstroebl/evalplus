```python
def below_threshold(l, t):
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This function uses the `all` function to iterate over each item in the input list `l` and compare each item against the threshold `t`. 

It returns `True` if all items are below the threshold, and `False` otherwise. 

This solution corresponds to the provided specification in the prompt, including the test examples.
