```python
def below_threshold(l, t):
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
The function `below_threshold` uses the built-in Python function `all` to iterate over each element in the input list `l` and compare it to the threshold value `t`. The function returns `True` if all elements in the list are below the threshold, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is an example of how to use the code:
```python
 >>> below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100)
True
 >>> below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5)
False
```
This example demonstrates the function's behavior for two different lists, showing that it returns `True` for the first case because all list elements are less than the threshold `100`, and returns `False` for the second case because not all list elements are less than the threshold `5`.  This confirms that the new implementation behaves correctly according to the given tests.
