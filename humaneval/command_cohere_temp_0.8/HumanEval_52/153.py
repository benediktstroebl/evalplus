```python
def below_threshold(l, t):
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This function uses the `all()` function to iterate over each list element `x` and compare it to the threshold `t`. The iteration continues until the condition returns False, and the overall result will be True if all comparisons are True. The output will be False if any comparison evaluates to False. 

This function's behavior is defined by the "all" and "or" logical operators' short-circuit evaluation behavior, which is specified in the Python Language Reference.

This code provides an accurate solution to the problem, but it is worth noting that it is overkill for this particular problem, as it uses a nested function call that traverses the entire list when a single comparison would have sufficed. This is a good illustration of how delicate optimization can sometimes result in somewhat more complicated code. Here is a markdown code block that can be added to the script to ensure the function passes the provided tests:
```python
import unittest

class TestBelowThreshold(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_below_threshold(self):
        self.assertTrue(below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100))
    def test_below_threshold_false(self):
        self.assertFalse(below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5))
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
This test suite contains two test cases that cover the basic edge cases of the 'below_threshold' function. The first test case validates the function's correctness when the list contains all elements less than the threshold. The second test case contains at least one element greater than the threshold, so the function should return False.

The `unittest.main()` function is used to run the tests when the script is executed directly. For automated testing, the `unittest` module offers a variety of more sophisticated techniques.
