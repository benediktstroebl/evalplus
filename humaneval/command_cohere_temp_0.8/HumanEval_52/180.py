```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This function uses the `all` function to iterate over each element in the input list `l` and compare each element with the threshold value `t`. 
Since the problem statement does not specify any particular order for the numbers in the list, the `all` function also doesn't impose any specific order for checking the conditions.

Such a solution would remain the same even when the list `l` might contain millions of numbers, as the aggregate time complexity (amortized over all calls to the function) of this solution remains O(n), where `n` is the length of the input list `l`.

The function returns `True` if all numbers in the list are below the threshold, and `False` otherwise.

It is advisable to include tests in the codebase to ensure that the function behaves accordingly with the problem statement amidst hypothetical changes in the code. Below is a sample test that can be incorporated:
```python
def test_below_threshold():
    # Test list with single number
    assert below_threshold([1], 100) == True
    assert below_threshold([1], 1) == False

    # Test list with multiple numbers
    assert below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100) == True
    assert below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 5) == False

    # Test list with negative numbers
    assert below_threshold([100, -1, -20, -200], 0) == True
    assert below_threshold([100, -1, -20, -200], 200) == False
```
