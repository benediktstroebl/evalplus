```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This function uses the `all` function to iterate over each element in the input list `l` and compare each element with the threshold value `t`. 
Since the problem statement does not specify any particular order for the numbers in the list, the `all` function takes care of checking if all numbers in the list are below the threshold without the need for an explicit loop.

The function returns `True` if all numbers in the list are below the threshold, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is a simple test suite that can be used to verify the functionality of the function:
```python
def test_below_threshold():
    # Test case from the problem statement
    assert below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100) == True

    # Test case from the problem statement
    assert below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5) == False

    # Additional test case
    assert below_threshold([0, 0, 0], 0) == False

    # Additional test case
    assert below_threshold([7, 1, 3, 9, 10, 2, 5], 7) == False
``` 
This test suite covers the two test cases provided in the original problem statement and includes two additional test cases to further validate the function. 

To run the test suite, you can simply call the `test_below_threshold()` function in your Python environment. 

Note that to run the test suite, you may need to install Python and set up a development environment, including additional tools like `pytest` for more advanced test cases. 
You can refer to online resources and tutorials for assistance in installing Python and setting up a testing environment if needed. 
Nevertheless, the provided basic test suite should already allow you to verify the functionality of the `below_threshold` function.
