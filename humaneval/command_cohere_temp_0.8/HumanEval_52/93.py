```python
def below_threshold(l, t):
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This function uses the built-in `all` function to iterate over each element in the input list `l` and compare it to the threshold value `t`. The function returns `True` if all elements in the list are below the threshold, and `False` otherwise.

Here is a simple test case to ensure the function is correct:
```python
assert below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100) == True
```

And another test case to check its functionality:
```python
assert below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5) == False
```

The function is self-contained and does not rely on any external variables or assumptions, and it should work correctly for any valid input. 
If the problem requires any specific assumptions, please provide the full problem statement so that the solution can be updated accordingly. 

Feel free to test this function with different lists and threshold values to verify its behavior. Let me know if you need any more assistance with problem solving or anything else you may require!
