```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This function uses the `all()` function to iterate over each element in the input list `l` and compares each element with the threshold value `t`. 

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```python
list_ = [1, 2, 4, 10]
threshold = 100

print(below_threshold(list_, threshold))
```
This will output:
```
True
```

This function will return `True` because all the numbers in the list are less than the threshold value of 100. 

If the list contains numbers greater than the threshold, the function will return `False`. 

For example:
```python
list_ = [1, 20, 4, 10]
threshold = 5

print(below_threshold(list_, threshold))
```
This will output:
```
False
```

This is because the list contains a number (20) that is greater than the threshold value of 5. Thus, the function returns `False`. 

This script successfully passes the tests provided in the prompt, as it correctly determines whether the list of integers is comprised of values all below the specified threshold.
