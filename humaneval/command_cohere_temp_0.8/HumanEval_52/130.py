```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This function uses the `all()` function to iterate over each list element `x` and compare it to the threshold `t`. The `all()` function returns `True` if all comparisons are `True` and `False` otherwise, returning the overall conclusion about the list being below the threshold. 
The function signature includes type hints specifying the expected types of the input arguments (`list` and `int`) and the return value (`bool`). These hints help to provide better clarity and ensure that the function is used correctly. In the below code, the tests are omitted, but the function should still pass them, assuming they are properly defined.
