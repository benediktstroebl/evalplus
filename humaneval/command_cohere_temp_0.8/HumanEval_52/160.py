```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This function uses the `all()` function to iterate over each element in the input list `l` and compare each element with the threshold value `t`. 
The result is a boolean indicating whether all elements in the list are below the threshold, which corresponds to the behavior described in the problem statement.
