```python
def below_threshold(l, t):
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This function uses the `all()` function to iterate over each element in the input list `l` and compare each element to the threshold value `t`. 

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```python
>>> below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100)
True
>>> below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5)
False
```
This would return respectively return `True` and `False`, as all elements in the list are below the threshold value, respectively. 

This function is self-contained and does not rely on any external variables or classes. 

If needed, it can also be easily integrated into a larger script or application.
