```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This function uses the `all()` function to iterate over each element in the input list `l` and compare each element with the threshold value `t`. 

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```python
list_ = [1, 2, 4, 10]
threshold = 100
print(below_threshold(list_, threshold))
```
This will output:
```
True
```

And here is another example where the list contains one element that is not below the threshold, resulting in the function returning `False`:
```python
list_ = [1, 20, 4, 10]
threshold = 5
print(below_threshold(list_, threshold))
```
This will output:
```
False
```

This new implementation passes the given tests and is more intuitive and simpler to understand. It directly returns the boolean result of the comparison instead of manipulating the list and therefore reduces the complexity of the function.
