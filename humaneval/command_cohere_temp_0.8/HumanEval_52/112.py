```python
def below_threshold(l, t):
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
The function `below_threshold` uses the `all` function to check if all the numbers in the list `l` are below the threshold `t`. 

This solution is more concise than the original code, which provided a comment and example tests within the function. If you would like the solution to follow the original format, I am happy to provide it for you. 

Let me know if you would like me to explain any part of the solution or clarify any tests.
