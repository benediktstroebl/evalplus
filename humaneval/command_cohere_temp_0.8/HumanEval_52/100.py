```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This function uses the `all()` function to iterate over each list element `x`, comparing it to the threshold `t` using the `<` operator. The `all()` function returns `True` if all comparisons are `True`, indicating that all numbers in the list are below the threshold, otherwise `False`. 

Here is a simpler approach that uses a list comprehension:
```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This approach uses a list comprehension, which is a concise way to create a new list based on the values of an existing list. In this case, the list comprehension checks each element in the existing list against the threshold value, creating a new list of Boolean values indicating whether each element is below the threshold. The `all()` function then checks if all the Boolean values in the new list are `True`, which indicates that all elements of the original list are below the threshold. 

Both approaches above seem to meet the requirements of the posed problem and pass the provided tests. Choose the one that suits your preferred style and clarity preferences.
