```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This function uses the `all()` function to iterate over each list element `x`, comparing it to the threshold `t` using the `<` operator. The `all()` function returns `True` if all comparisons are `True`, indicating that all numbers in the list are below the threshold, otherwise `False`. 
The function's docstring describes its purpose, input, and behavior and also includes example tests. You can use these examples to verify the function's correct operation. Locate the below-defined function within a Python script to solve the problem and pass the provided tests. 
You can ensure it works correctly for other scenarios by adding more test cases if necessary.
