```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This function uses the `all` function to iterate over each element in the input list `l` and compares each element with the threshold value `t`. 
Since the problem statement does not specify any particular order for the numbers in the list, the `all` function takes care of checking if all numbers in the list are below the threshold without the need for an explicit loop. The output of this function is a boolean value, True if all numbers are below the threshold, and False otherwise. 

This code matches the given solution in the sense that it returns True for the first test case ([1, 2, 4, 10], 100) and False for the second test case ([1, 20, 4, 10], 5). It is also efficient as it uses a built-in function for its core logic.
