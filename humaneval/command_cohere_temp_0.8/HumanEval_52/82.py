```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This function uses the `all()` function to iterate over each list element `x`, comparing it to the threshold `t`. The `all()` function returns `True` if all comparisons are `True`, indicating that all list elements are below the threshold, otherwise `False`.  This behavior is reflected in the example tests provided in the prompt, which show that the function returns `True` for a list of integers below the given threshold and `False` otherwise. 
To ensure completeness, this code snippet is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem statement with the provided function definition, output logic, and example tests.
