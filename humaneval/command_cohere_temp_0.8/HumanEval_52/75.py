```python
def below_threshold(l, t):
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This function uses the built-in `all` function to iterate over each element in the input list `l` and compare it to the threshold value `t`. It then returns `True` if all elements in the list are below the threshold, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is how you can use this function correctly as per the test cases provided: 
```python
>>> below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100)
True
>>> below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5)
False
``` 
This function is more concise than the original implementation in the prompt, and it effectively utilizes Python's list and comparison capabilities. 

If you would like to test more cases to verify its correctness, you can uncomment the test code block below and run the script:
```python 
# test_below_threshold.py
def test_below_threshold():
    # Test case 1
    l = [1, 2, 4, 10]
    t = 100
    assert below_threshold(l, t) == True

    # Test case 2
    l = [1, 20, 4, 10]
    t = 5
    assert below_threshold(l, t) == False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_below_threshold()
```
