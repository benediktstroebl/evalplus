```python
def below_threshold(l, t):
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
The function `below_threshold` uses the built-in Python function `all` to return True if all elements in the list `l` are less than the threshold `t`.

Here is a snippet of a Python test module to verify the functionality of the solution:
```python
def test_below_threshold():
    assert below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100) == True
    assert below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5) == False
```

The test module uses the Python `assert` statement to verify that the `below_threshold` function returns the expected values for the given tests.  The code within the `test_below_threshold()` function is an example of test-driven development, where the tests are created first as a means of defining the functionality of the solution.  In this case, the `below_threshold()` function is well-defined such that the tests pass with expected True and False values.  Thus, the functionality of the function is validated through the tests.  This approach ensures that the code meets the requirements and correctly solves the problem.  It's a practice that helps prevent errors and ensures that any changes to the code going forward adhere to the problem's criteria.
