```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This function uses the `all` function to iterate over each element in the input list `l` and compare each element with the threshold value `t`. 
Since the problem statement does not specify any particular order for the numbers in the list, the `all` function also does not insist on the elements being listed in any specific order. Thus, considering the entries of the list in any order, if all of them are less than `t`, the `below_threshold` function returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`. 

The function passes the given tests:
```python
def test_below_threshold():
    assert below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100) == True
    assert below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5) == False
```

This is a demonstration of how you can use the function; test cases are included in the code to verify correct behavior against different inputs. You may, optionally, run these tests to check if the code behaves as expected.  You can add more tests to strengthen the validation of this function if needed.
