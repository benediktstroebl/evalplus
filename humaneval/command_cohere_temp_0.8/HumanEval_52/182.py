```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This function uses the `all` function to iterate over each element in the input list `l` and compare each element with the threshold value `t`. 
Since the problem statement does not specify any particular order for the numbers in the list, the `all` function also doesn't impose any specific order for its truthiness. 

This code directly implements the requirement of the problem statement and returns `True` if all numbers in the list are below the threshold and `False` otherwise. 

The tests included in the original problem statement confirm the correctness of this implementation. 
```python
>>> below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100)
True
>>> below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5)
False
```
This code is also efficient, with a time complexity of `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input list `l` since it iterates over the list only once using the `all` function. 
The space complexity is `O(1)`, which is suitable for a binary boolean result. 
It does not require any additional space. So the function is both efficient and correct. 
Let me know if you would like to provide another problem for which you'd like to see a self-contained Python script with an explanation.
