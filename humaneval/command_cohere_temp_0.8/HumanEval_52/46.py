```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This function uses the `all()` function to iterate over each element in the input list `l` and compare each element with the threshold value `t`. 
The result is returned as a boolean value `True` if all elements are below the threshold, and `False` otherwise.

Here is a simple test case to verify the functionality of the function:
```python
test_cases = [[1, 2, 4, 10], [1, 20, 4, 10]]
threshold = [100, 5]
expected_results = [True, False]

for i in range(len(test_cases)):
    assert below_threshold(test_cases[i], threshold[i]) == expected_results[i]
```
This will verify that the new function implementation produces the correct result for both test cases. 
The `assert` statement will raise an exception if the evaluation of the expression on the left is false, indicating that the test case has failed. 

The code inside the loop will ensure that each test case has the same result as the expected result. 
This helps to validate the correctness of the function and ensures that it passes the given test cases. 
The function passes this test case, and the given markdown code block verifies the correctness of the function against the provided test cases. 
This approach ensures that the function remains self-contained and easy to understand and maintain. G
iving the complete test cases and expected results in the same code block that defines the function provides a comprehensive and standalone illustration of its implementation and validation.
