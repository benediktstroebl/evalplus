```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This function uses the `all` function to iterate over each element in the input list `l` and compare each element with the threshold value `t`. 
Since the problem statement does not specify any particular order for the elements in the list, the implementation uses a vanilla iterable comprehension without any sort of sorting or ordering.

The function returns `True` if all elements in the list are below the threshold, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is a test case that validates the functionality of the function:
```python
def test_below_threshold():
    assert below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100) == True
    assert below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5) == False
```

You can run this test case to verify that the function works as expected. 
This code snippet should help solve the problem and pass the given tests. 
It is concise, readable, and efficient, which are qualities of good code. 
These qualities are especially important for Python since its versatility and simplicity make it a popular choice for many different types of projects.
