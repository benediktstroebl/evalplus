```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This function uses the `all` function to iterate over each item in the input list `l` and compare each item with the threshold value `t`. 

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```python
print(below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100))
```
This will return:
```
True
```
The function will return `True` because all numbers in the list are below the threshold value of 100. 

Here is another example:
```python
print(below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5))
```
This will return:
```
False
```
The function will return `False` because one or more numbers in the list are above the threshold value of 5. 

This revised version of the function is more concise and straightforward, and it passes the given tests. It eliminates the need for a separate boolean variable and simplifies the condition to be checked, making the code more readable and maintainable.
