```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This function uses the `all` function to iterate over each element in the input list `l` and checks if each element is less than the given threshold `t`. 

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100)
True
>>> below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5)
False
```
This example shows the function's behavior and its truthfulness in accordance with the given examples in the problem statement.
