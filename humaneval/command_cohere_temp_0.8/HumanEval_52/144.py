```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This function uses the `all()` function to iterate over each element in the input list `l` and compare each element with the threshold value `t`. 
Since the problem statement does not specify any particular order for the elements in the list, the `all()` function also doesn't guarantee the order in which it checks the conditions.

Such a function should return `True` if all elements in the list are below the threshold, and `False` otherwise. 

The function is self-contained and does not rely on any external variables or assumptions beyond the input parameters. 
It also meets the expectations of the problem as it passes both test cases mentioned in the problem statement. 

This function can be directly called with any list of numbers and a threshold value to determine whether all numbers in the list are below the threshold. 
For example:
```python
print(below_threshold([1, 2, 3, 4], 5))  # Output: True
print(below_threshold([5, 4, 3, 2], 5))  # Output: False
``` 

Feel free to use this function to solve the problem or adapt it for other use cases requiring a list of numbers to be checked against a threshold value. 
If you'd like to test more cases, please do so and verify that the function accurately handles them. 
If you face any issues or have further questions, feel free to ask for assistance. A summary of the solution and a demonstration of its usage with examples are provided. 
The function is also robust and can be readily used in other scenarios where a list of numbers needs to be checked against a threshold value.
