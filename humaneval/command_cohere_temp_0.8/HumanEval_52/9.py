```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This function uses the `all` function to iterate over each element in the input list `l` and compare each element with the threshold value `t`. 

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```python
>>> below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100)
True
>>> below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5)
False
```
This would return the values of True and False, respectively, which conforms to the previously desired functionality. 

Let's import the `all` function from the `itertools` module to perform this comparison more concisely. 

Here is a version of the code that imports the `all` function:
```python
from itertools import all

def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
We can further provide example documentation in the code, as done previously, to explain the function's purpose and demonstrate its usage. 

Here is an example of the documentation for the `below_threshold` function:
```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    """
    Return True if all numbers in the list l are below threshold t, otherwise False.
    
    Examples:
    >>> below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100)
    True
    >>> below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5)
    False
    """
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This provides a clear and concise description of the function's purpose, and the examples section demonstrates its usage. 

This function can be easily imported and used in other Python scripts and applications.
