```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This function uses the `all()` function to iterate over each list element `x`, comparing it to the threshold `t` using the `<` operator. The `all()` function returns `True` if all comparisons are `True`, indicating that all elements are below the threshold, otherwise `False`. 
The function's docstring highlights its expected behavior through examples, indicating that it returns `True` if all numbers in the list `l` are below the threshold `t`, while returning `False` otherwise. Fulfilling the brief of accepting a list of numbers and a threshold as inputs and returning a boolean corresponding to whether all list elements are below the threshold or not, this function serves its purpose effectively.
