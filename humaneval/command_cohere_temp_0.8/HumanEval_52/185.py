```python
def below_threshold(l, t):
    return all(x < t for x in l)
```
This function uses the `all()` function to iterate over each list element `x` and compare it to the threshold `t`. The `all()` function returns `True` if all comparisons are `True` since the iterable is empty upon encountering the first `False` comparison, and otherwise `False`. The function then returns `True` if all the elements in the list are below the threshold, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```python
print(below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100))
print(below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5))
```
This would result in the following output:
```
True
False
```
This demonstrates that the function correctly determines if the list contains elements less than the given threshold and is correctly influenced by them.
