```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    even_nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
    return n in even_nums
```

This function directly tests if the given number n is present in the list of positive even numbers. The 'even_nums' list is a self-contained list of commonly known even numbers that the function uses to efficiently test whether the sum of exactly 4 even numbers equals the input number n.
