Here's a Python script that contains a function called `is_equal_to_sum_even` that solves the problem you've described:
```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    even_nums = [2 * x for x in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1)]
    return n == sum(even_nums)
```
This function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of even numbers from 1 to the square root of `n`. It then returns `True` if the sum of these even numbers equals `n`, and `False` otherwise.

To test this function, you can write an analogous function that checks if a number can be expressed as the sum of 5 positive even numbers, and additionally, a function that checks if a number can be expressed as the sum of an arbitrary number of positive even numbers, which should respectively diverge and return `True` for all positive integers.

This approach ensures the function is self-contained and can be understood in isolation, as it doesn't rely on external resources or assumptions beyond the intrinsic properties of integers.
