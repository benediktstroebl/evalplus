```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    even_numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
    return n in even_numbers
```

This function uses a list of even numbers from 2 to 20 as a reference to evaluate whether the given number can be expressed as a sum of four positive even numbers.

To check the functionality, let's run some tests:
```python
# Test cases
assert is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True
assert is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False
assert is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False
assert is_equal_to_sum_even(22) == False
```

The tests should confirm the expected behavior of the function.
