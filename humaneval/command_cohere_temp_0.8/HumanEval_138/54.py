```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    even_nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
    return n in even_nums
```

This function directly tests if the given number n is present in the list of positive even numbers. The list `even_nums` can be expanded further to ensure the function returns correctly for any input greater than 100. Would you like to test more cases or add additional functionality? Feel free to provide more information and prompts related to the desired specifications of the script.
