```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    # Check whether n can be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers
    # First, set up equation as sum of two pairs
    even1, even2 = n // 2, n // 2
    # If both even numbers are positive (non-negative), return True
    return (even1 >= 0 and even2 >= 0 and even1 <= even2) or (even1 >= even2 and even2 == 0)
```

The function splits the positive integer `n` evenly into two positive even numbers, then checks whether both even numbers are in a valid configuration: either both are positive (non-negative), or one is zero and the other is positive. This correctly evaluates the condition outlined in the problem statement. 

To see this function in action, create a Python file, `is_equal_to_sum_even.py`, and add this function declaration to it. You can then call this function with different inputs to test its correctness:
```python
# Test Scenario
print( is_equal_to_sum_even(8) )    # Should print True
print( is_equal_to_sum_even(7) )    # Should print False
print( is_equal_to_sum_even(10) )   # Should print False
```

This script will help you evaluate whether a given number can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers, as specified in the problem statement.
