```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    even_nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]
    return n in even_nums
```

This function directly tests if the given number n is present in the list of positive even numbers. The function returns True if the number can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder, otherwise, it returns False. This solution relies on the inherent nature of odd numbers, where they are not divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder, and equally important, that the list of even numbers is closed under this operation. Therefore, this function directly answers the question of whether n can be written as an sum of 4 positive even numbers. 

Here is a simple test suite that can be used to validate the function:
```python
# Test Suite
assert is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True
assert is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False
assert is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False
assert is_equal_to_sum_even(7) == False
``` 

This test suite covers a variety of scenarios to validate the behavior of the function, including correct and incorrect outputs. 
```bash
python test.py
```

In addition, you can use a more scalable approach to test the function by generating a list of numbers and comparing it to a list of numbers that adhere to the required criteria, using a for loop to test multiple iterations and ensure the function's behavior corresponds to the given problem:
```python
def test_is_equal_to_sum_even():
    for n in range(1, 500):
        if is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
            print(f'The number {n} can be written as the sum of 4 even numbers')
        else:
            print(f'The number {n} cannot be written as the sum of 4 even numbers')
``` 

In order to execute this test suite, you can simply run the script `test.py` using the command `python test.py` in order to see the function's behavior across different input values.
