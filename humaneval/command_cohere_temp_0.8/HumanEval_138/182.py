Here's a Python script that contains a function called `is_equal_to_sum_even` that solves the problem you've described:
```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    even_nums = [2 * i for i in range(1, (n // 2) + 1)]
    return n == sum(even_nums)
```
This function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of even numbers from 1 to `(n // 2)`. It then returns true if `n` is equal to the sum of the even numbers in the list, and false otherwise. 

Here's a brief explanation of how it works:
1. The function `is_equal_to_sum_even` takes a single argument `n`, which represents the number we want to evaluate.
2. It creates a list called `even_nums` using a list comprehension. This list contains twice as many integers as there are integers in the range from 1 to `n // 2`. The integers are created by multiplying `i` by 2, where `i` runs through the values from 1 to `(n // 2)`. This effectively creates a list of even numbers from 2 to `n // 2` (since we're doubling each integer).
3. Finally, the function returns `True` if the sum of the numbers in `even_num_list` equals `n`, and `False` otherwise.

This solution is efficient and can quickly determine whether a given number can be represented as the sum of four positive even numbers.
