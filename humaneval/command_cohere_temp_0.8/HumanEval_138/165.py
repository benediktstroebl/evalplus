```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    even_numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]
    sum_of_even = sum(even_numbers)
    return n == sum_of_even
```

This function uses a list of even numbers from 2 to 20, half of which are positive, and half are negative. It then calculates the sum of this list via the `sum()` function. If this sum equals the target number, the function returns `True`, thereby signaling that the target number can be written as the sum of four positive even numbers.

To operationalize this, you can incorporate additional tests to cover more edge cases like so:
```python
# Test the function with a positive integer
assert is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True

# Test the function with a negative integer
assert is_equal_to_sum_even(-8) == False

# Test the function with a decimal
assert is_equal_to_sum_even(10.5) == False
```

This battery of tests should reliably verify the function's correctness across a range of scenarios.
