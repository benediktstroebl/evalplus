```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    even_nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
    return n in even_nums
```

This function directly tests if the given number n is present in the list of positive even numbers. The 'even_nums' list can be altered to include other positive even numbers, thereby adjusting the scope of numbers the function can handle. 

To better understand the logic behind this solution, let's break down the process:
1. Understanding the Problem: The problem asks whether a given number can be represented as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers.
2. Defining the Function: The function `is_equal_to_sum_even` accepts a single argument n, which will be tested.
3. Creating a List of Positive Even Numbers: To simplify the process, it constructs a list 'even_nums' containing positive even integers from 2 to 20 (although this can be adjusted based on problem constraints).
4. Testing Membership: The function checks if the given number n is present in the list 'even_nums'. This is done using the 'in' operator, which has a negligible constant time complexity O(1) overhead.
5. Returning the Result: If n is found in the list, the function returns True, indicating that the number can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers. If n is not in the list, it returns False. 

This approach allows the function to determine if a given number can be expressed as the required sum quickly and efficiently in a self-contained manner. 

Please note that this approach works well for numbers within the range of the even numbers in the list. Adjustments may be required for more expansive problem constraints.
