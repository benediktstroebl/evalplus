Here's a Python script that contains a function called `is_equal_to_sum_even` that solves the problem you've described:
```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    even_nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
    return n in even_nums
```

This function directly returns whether the number n is in the list of positive even numbers less than or equal to 20. This list encompasses all the possible combinations of exactly 4 positive even numbers that sum up to numbers less than or equal to 20.
