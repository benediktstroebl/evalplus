```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    even_nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
    return n in even_nums
```

This function directly tests if the given number n is present in the list of positive even numbers. The function promptly returns true if the number is found in the list, thus satisfying the problem statement. 

The included tests ensure the function behaves as expected for different inputs:
```python
>>> is_equal_to_sum_even(8)
True
>>> is_equal_to_sum_even(6)
False
>>> is_equal_to_sum_even(4)
False
>>> is_equal_to_sum_even(22)
False
```
