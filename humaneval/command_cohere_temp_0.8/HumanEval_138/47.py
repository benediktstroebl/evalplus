```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    even_nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
    return n in even_nums
```

This function directly tests if the given number n is present in the list of positive even numbers. The 'even_nums' list contains a range of positive even integers from 2 to 20, which is then used to compare and evaluate whether the given number can be expressed as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. This solution is concise and directly addresses the problem statement, making it efficient and adhering to the principle of least surprise. 

This approach boasts a time complexity of O(1) since it involves a constant time operation to check if the target number is present in the pre-computed list. This is advantageous relative to alternative approaches that might entail computing the sum of a varying number of integers, hence suffering from a worse time complexity of O(n). 

Note that to enhance solution coverage and handle edge cases, unit tests should be included to cover a spectrum of scenarios, such as edge numbers, decimals, and negative numbers, to ensure the function delivers the expected results for all plausible inputs.
