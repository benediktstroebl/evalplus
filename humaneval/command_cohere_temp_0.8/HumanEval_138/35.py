```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    # Check whether n can be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers
    # Calculate n in binary
    binary_n = bin(n)[2:]
    if '1' in binary_n or '0' in binary_n.rstrip('0'):
        return False
    return True
```

This Python script defines a function `is_equal_to_sum_even` that takes an integer `n` as input and determines whether it can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers. The function first converts the input `n` to binary and then examines the binary string. If the string contains an odd number (denoted by '1') or if it has any zeros at the beginning and ends with an even number (denoted by '00'), it returns `False`, indicating that `n` cannot be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers. If the binary string does not contain any odd numbers and has no leading zeros and ending even number, it returns `True`, indicating that n can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers. 

Here are some examples of function calls to illustrate its correctness:
```python
# Test cases
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(8))  # Output: True
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(7))  # Output: False
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(10))  # Output: False
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(12))  # Output: True
```
