```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    even_nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
    return n in even_nums
```

This function directly tests if the given number n is present in the list of positive even numbers. 

To ensure this function remains self-contained, the list of even numbers is included directly in the code, avoiding any external dependencies. 

This solution will serve the problem requirement to test if a given number can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. 

If this solution meets your needs, let me know if there are other ways I can assist. 

If you would like a different solution approach, provide any constraints, and I'll be happy to adjust my response accordingly.
