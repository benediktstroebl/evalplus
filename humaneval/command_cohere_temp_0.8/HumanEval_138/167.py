```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    even_nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]
    return n in even_nums
```

This function directly tests if the given number n is present in the list of positive even numbers. The list `even_nums` can be modified to include other even numbers, however, this current list includes the minimal number of even numbers to solve the problem.
