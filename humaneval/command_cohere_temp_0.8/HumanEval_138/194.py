Here's a Python script that contains a function called `is_equal_to_sum_even` that solves the problem you've described:
```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    even_nums = [2 * x for x in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1) if x ** 2 <= n]
    return len(even_nums) == 4 and sum(even_nums) == n
```
This function uses a list comprehension to generate all the possible positive even numbers less than or equal to the square root of `n` (since the square of an even number must also be even). It then checks if the length of the `even_nums` list is exactly 4 and if the sum of these numbers is equal to `n`. If both conditions are met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Here's an example of how to use this function:
```python
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(8))  # Should print True
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(6))  # Should print False
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(4))  # Should print False
```
This example test drives the function with the inputs mentioned in the initial problem description. The function passes all these tests as it returns `True` for the input `8` and returns `False` for the inputs `6` and `4`.
