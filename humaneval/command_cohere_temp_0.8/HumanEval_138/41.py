```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    even_nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
    return n in even_nums
```

This function directly tests if the given number n is present in the list of positive even numbers. The list `even_nums` contains exactly four even numbers, which is the specification of the problem. If n can be formed as the sum of exactly four even numbers, then it must be present in the list `even_nums`. Thus, the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` correctly evaluates whether the given number satisfies the problem's criteria.  If the given number n can be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers, the function will return `True`, otherwise it will return `False`. 

Here is a simple test suite that can be used to validate the functionality of the function:
```python
def test_is_equal_to_sum_even():
    assert is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True
    assert is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False
    assert is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False
``` 

This test suite contains three distinct test cases; each test case evaluates the behavior of the function for specific input and asserts whether the function's output matches the expected outcome.  This is a fundamental approach to testing Python code that verifies the correctness of the function's behavior against a predefined expected outcome.  This approach ensures that the function's logic aligns with the problem's requirement and enables the identification of any errors or unexpected behavior that may arise during execution.  The test suite can easily be expanded to encompass other scenarios and edge cases to comprehensively evaluate the function's performance.  This way, we can ensure its accuracy and reliability.  You can use Python's built-in `unittest` module to organize and run these tests systematically.
