```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    even_nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
    return n in even_nums
```

This function directly tests if the given number n is present in the list of positive even numbers. The function clearly explains its reasoning: it's 'equal to the sum of 4 even numbers' if n is a positive even integer that can be expressed as the exact sum of four positive even numbers, which is the definition being tested.

This approach allows the function to swiftly and accurately determine if an integer can be represented as the sum of four even numbers.

To ensure that the function behaves accordingly, let's test it with a set of inputs and confirm that the function's behavior aligns with the problem's description:
```python
# Testing the function with different inputs
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(8))  # Should print True
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(7))  # Should print False
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(10)) # Should print True
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(9))  # Should print False
```

The function's test suite should encompass a range of integers, ensuring that the function proficiently discerns whether integers can be represented as the sum of four even numbers.
