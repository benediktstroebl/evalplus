Here's a Python script that contains a function called `is_equal_to_sum_even` that evaluates whether a given number can be written as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers. The function is designed to return `True` if the condition is met and `False` otherwise:
```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    even_nums = [2 * i for i in range(1, (n // 2) + 1)]
    return n == sum(even_nums) and n == 4 * sum(even_nums)
```
This function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of even numbers from 1 to `(n // 2)`. It then checks whether the sum of these even numbers is equal to the target number `n`, and whether the sum of their count 4 is equal to `n`. If both conditions are met, it returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Here is a snippet of testing the function on a few test cases to demonstrate its behavior:
```python
# Testing the function on some test cases
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(4))  # Expected: False
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(6))  # Expected: False
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(8))  # Expected: True
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(10))  # Expected: False
```
The function's behavior should now be well-defined and capable of solving the problem outlined in the original prompt.
