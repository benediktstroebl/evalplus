```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
The code defines a Python function called fib that takes an integer n as input. It employs a recursive approach to calculate the Fibonacci sequence by invoking itself with two smaller inputs, n-1 and n-2, representing the two previous Fibonacci numbers. The base cases are when n is equal to 1 or 0, where it returns n directly as these are the first two numbers in the sequence. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers, effectively building up the sequence.
