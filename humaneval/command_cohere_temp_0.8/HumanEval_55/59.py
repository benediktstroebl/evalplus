```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
The `Fibonacci sequence` is an integer sequence where the first two terms are 0 and 1. All other terms are obtained by adding the preceding two values. Although there is no closed form for the nth Fibonacci number, this sequence can be effectively computed using recursive or iterative methods. 

Here's how the function works:
1. The function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. In this base case, it directly returns `n` as the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1.
2. If `n` is greater than 1, the function recursively calls itself with the arguments `n-1` and `n-2`. These two arguments will recursively compute the two preceding Fibonacci numbers.
3. At each recursive call, the function returns the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers until it reaches the base case, thereby providing the nth Fibonacci number as the answer. 

The function is designed to handle any positive `int` input for `n` and provides the corresponding Fibonacci number as the output, as evidenced by the test cases in the original problem statement. 

This approach is efficient due to the property of the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is thereafter is the sum of the two preceding ones. Hence, the time complexity of the algorithm is logarithmic, which is advantageous as opposed to a linear approach that would result in very large numbers and higher time complexity.
