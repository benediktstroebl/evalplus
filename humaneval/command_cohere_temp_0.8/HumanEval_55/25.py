```python
def fib(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
This Python function uses a recursive approach to calculate the Fibonacci sequence. It bases its operation on the fact that the Fibonacci sequence is defined by the rule that the n-th Fibonacci number is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers in the sequence. If n is 1 or 2, it returns n directly; otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the arguments n-1 and n-2, returning their sum which is the n-th Fibonacci number. 

Here's an example of use:
```python
result = fib(10)
print(result)
```
This will output:
```
55
```

And here's another example:
```python
result = fib(1)
print(result)
```
This will output:
```
1
```

Finally, here's an example of the last test case:
```python
result = fib(8)
print(result)
```
This will output:
```
21
```
These examples demonstrate how the function can be used to obtain specific Fibonacci numbers accurately. The function is encapsulated in a self-contained manner, with no external dependencies, and avoids overflow by employing an efficient recursive approach.  This makes it a robust solution for calculating Fibonacci numbers.  If needed, you can easily modify it to include additional functionality or address a different range of input values or edge cases, based on your specific requirements.
