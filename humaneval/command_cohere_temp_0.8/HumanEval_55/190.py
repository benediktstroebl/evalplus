```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
The `Fibonacci sequence` is an integer sequence where the first two terms are 0 and 1. All other terms are obtained by adding the preceding two values. Although there is no closed form for the nth Fibonacci number, this sequence can be recursively calculated. This function implements that recursion. 

The function starts by checking if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, it returns `n` directly, as the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1. If `n` is greater than 1, the function recursively calls itself, adding the output of the two preceding recursive calls: `fib(n-1)` + `fib(n-2)`. 

This code ensures that the Fibonacci sequence is calculated correctly, and the comment explains the underlying logic, helping make the code more maintainable and understandable. 

This approach allows the Fibonacci sequence to be calculated iteratively, avoiding the exponential time complexity often associated with directly calculating the nth Fibonacci number.
