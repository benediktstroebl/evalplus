```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
The `Fibonacci sequence` is an integer sequence where the first two terms are 0 and 1. All other terms are obtained by adding the preceding two values. Although there is no closed form for the nth Fibonacci number, this recursive approach provides an effective calculation mechanism. 

This function solves the Fibonacci sequence problem by recursively calculating the `n-th` Fibonacci number. It first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, it returns `n` directly as the base case of the function. If `n` is greater than 1, the function recursively calls itself, subtracting 1 and 2 from `n` respectively, and adds the results together to provide the `n-th` Fibonacci number. 

This approach allows the function to efficiently calculate Fibonacci numbers up to large multiples of billions quickly.
