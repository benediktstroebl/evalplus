```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
The code defines a Python function called fib that calculates the n-th Fibonacci number. The base case checks if n is less than or equal to 1, returning n if so. Otherwise, the function recursively computes the sum of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th Fibonacci numbers, utilizing the series definition of Fibonacci numbers. This recursive approach efficiently computes Fibonacci numbers. The function's docstring provides guidance and example usage.
