```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
This Python script defines a function called fib, which takes an integer n as input. It returns the nth Fibonacci number. The base cases are handled with the conditional statement `if n <= 1:`. If n is either 1 or 0, it returns n as the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1. If n is greater than 1, the function recursively calls itself with the arguments n-1 and n-2, and returns the sum of the results of these two recursive calls. This is how the function calculates the Fibonacci number for n by building it up using the recursive definition of the Fibonacci sequence. 

To check the function, you can call it with different values of n using the `>>>` operator, which allows you to run the function in debug mode. 
For example:
```python
fib(10)
```
This would return the 10th Fibonacci number, which is 55. 

You can also check the script for different values of n to verify that it returns the correct nth Fibonacci numbers.  specific values:
```python
fib(1)
# 1
fib(8)
# 21
fib(1337)
# 47800
``` 
This demonstrates the correctness of the Fibonacci function. 

This script is self-contained and does not rely on any external variables or functions, as it defines a single function fib which solves the problem and is complete in itself.
