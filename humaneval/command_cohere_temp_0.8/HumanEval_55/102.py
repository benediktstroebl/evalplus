```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
The `Fibonacci sequence` is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. This python script provides a function called `fib`, which calculates the nth Fibonacci number. It works by recursively calling itself with the arguments n-1 and n-2, adding the results to produce the nth Fibonacci number. The base cases are handled with `n<=1`, which returns n since the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1. 

Here are some examples of how this function can be called to illustrate its behavior:
```python
>> fib(10)
55
>> fib(1)
1
>> fib(8)
21
```
