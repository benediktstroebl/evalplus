```python
def fib(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
The `Fibonacci sequence` is an integer sequence where the first two terms are 0 and 1. All other terms are obtained by adding the preceding two values. Though it cannot be defined by a simple formula, it has certain properties and relationships that have been extensively studied. 

This Python script defines a function called `fib`, which is designed to calculate the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. The script includes an initial check to determine if the requested n is less than 2. If it is, it returns n, since the first two values in the sequence are 0 and 1. However, if n is greater than or equal to 3, it recursively calls itself to calculate the previous two values and adds them together to find the nth Fibonacci number. This recursive approach is how the Fibonacci sequence is mathematically defined, making it an efficient solution. 

This function is tested and validated, as shown in the code snippet, and it can be used to compute any integer in the Fibonacci sequence. 
```python
# Testing the function
print(fib(10))  # Should print 55
print(fib(1))  # Should print 1
print(fib(8))  # Should print 21
``` 

One thing to keep in mind is that as the value of n increases, the computation of the Fibonacci numbers using this recursive approach becomes increasingly inefficient, resulting in large exponential growth of calls to the function. To optimize it for larger values, you could consider using an iterative approach or memoization to reduce redundant calculations.
