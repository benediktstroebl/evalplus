```python
def fib(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to calculate the Fibonacci sequence, which is an efficient way to solve this type of problem. It provides an elegant solution that fits in a single function, completing the task as requested.
