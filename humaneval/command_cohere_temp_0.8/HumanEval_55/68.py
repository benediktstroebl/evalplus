The `fib` function uses a recursive approach to calculate the Fibonacci sequence, which is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. It first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, returning `n` if so. If `n` is greater than 1, it returns the sum of the `n-1`th and `n-2`th Fibonacci numbers, which are the two preceding numbers in the sequence. This approach allows the function to compute the Fibonacci number for any input `n`.  The Markdown code block additionally includes docstrings and example usages, explaining the function's purpose and behavior with illustrative test cases.  This function can provide the n-th Fibonacci number efficiently for any positive integer `n`.  This approach has a time complexity of O(F(n)), where F(n) is the n-th Fibonacci number, which approximates O(2^n) as per the Fibonacci sequence's growth rate.
