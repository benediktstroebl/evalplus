```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
The code defines a recursive function `fib` that returns the n-th Fibonacci number. It checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, returning `n` if true. If not, it returns the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence (starting from `n-1` and `n-2`), which are the two most recent Fibonacci numbers. This logic follows the definition of Fibonacci numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, e.g., 5 is generated by adding 3 and 2, and 8 is generated by adding 5 and 3. The function's practical use can be seen in applications like calculating nature values or testing algorithms' performance against recursive calculations.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```python
print(fib(10)) # Output: 55
```
This calls the `fib` function with an argument of 10, which returns the 10th Fibonacci number, 55.
