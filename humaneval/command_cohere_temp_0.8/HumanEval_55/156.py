```python
def fib(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to calculate the Fibonacci sequence, which is an efficient solution for this problem. The base cases are handled with the `if n < 2:` statement, where `n` is less than 2, the function returns `n` as the first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1. For larger values of `n`, it recursively calls itself with the arguments `n-1` and `n-2` and adds the results to produce the Fibonacci number for the given input `n`.  This approach leverages the mathematical definition of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring that each number is computed based on the preceding two numbers. 
The function includes an informative docstring to explain its purpose, and the comments indicate the expected behavior of the function for various inputs.
