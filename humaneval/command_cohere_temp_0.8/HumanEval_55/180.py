```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
The `Fibonacci sequence` is an integer sequence where the first two terms are 0 and 1. All other terms are obtained by adding the preceding two values. Though it cannot be expressed as a closed-form expression, it is a simple sequence to generate and recognize. 

This Python script defines a function called `fib`, which uses a recursive approach to generate the nth Fibonacci number from n <= 1. It returns the first two numbers of the sequence when n is 0 or 1. However, for n > 2, it recursively calls itself, adding the two previous numbers (n-1 and n-2) to generate the nth number. 

To follow the markdowns in the original problem statement, the function includes a docstring that demonstrates the expected behavior of the function through examples. These examples are in the form of test cases that validate the function, ultimately proving its correctness.  This is the proper way to utilize markdown in documentation via Python.
