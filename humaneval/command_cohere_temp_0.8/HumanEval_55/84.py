```python
def fib(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
The `Fibonacci sequence` is a series of numbers in which each number (known as a Fibonacci number) is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

This function `fib(n)` takes an input `n`, which represents the index of the Fibonacci number we want to retrieve. The algorithm for this function is predicated on recursion. Recursion is a process in which a function calls itself to solve a problem in smaller steps. It repeatedly executes, changing its input until it reaches a base case that yields a direct answer.

In this specific case, the base case is when `n` is less than 2 (0 or 1). In such situations, it returns `n` since these are the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, and thus, by definition, the answer is deterministic.

When `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the function calls itself twice with the arguments `n-1` and `n-2`. This is because the Fibonacci sequence defines each number as the sum of the two preceding ones. So, if you want to find the `n`-th Fibonacci number, you can recursively compute it as the sum of the `(n-1)`th and `(n-2)`th Fibonacci numbers.

The function continues this recursive process until it reaches the base case, at which point it returns the answer, thus accomplishing the task of providing the `n`-th Fibonacci number.
