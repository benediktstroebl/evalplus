```python
def fib(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
The `Fibonacci sequence` is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. This python script provides a function called `fib`, which calculates the nth Fibonacci number. It works by recursively calculating the sum of the two preceding Fibonacci numbers, using a base case to stop the recursion when `n` is 2 or less. 

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```python
 Fibonacci_sequence = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144]
for i in range(len(Fibonacci_sequence)):
    assert fib(i) == Fibonacci_sequence[i]
```
This asserts that the `fib` function correctly calculates the i-th Fibonacci number for i from 0 to 14, which are the lengths of the two given sequences.
