```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
This Python script defines a function called fib, which takes an integer n as input. It returns the nth Fibonacci number. The base cases are handled with the conditional statement `if n <= 1`, where it returns n if n is either 1 or 0, which are the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. If n is greater than 1, it recursively calls itself with the arguments n-1 and n-2, and adds the results to compute the nth Fibonacci number. This code defines a valid function but is not optimized for performance due to the redundant recursive calls.

Here's a simple unit test using the `unittest` module to validate the function:
```python
import unittest

def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

class TestFibonacci(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_fib_at_zero(self):
        self.assertEqual(fib(0), 0)

    def test_fib_at_one(self):
        self.assertEqual(fib(1), 1)

    def test_fib_at_eight(self):
        self.assertEqual(fib(8), 21)

    def test_fib_at_ten(self):
        self.assertEqual(fib(10), 55)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This code provides a complete solution to the problem statement and validates the correctness of the `fib` function with five individual tests using the `unittest` framework, providing confidence in the accuracy of the Fibonacci implementation.  This approach allows for easy addition of new tests to cover a broader range of Fibonacci numbers if needed.  This helps ensure the function remains correct after any changes or improvements made to the code.  It also helps maintain separation of concerns, making the test suite readably understandable to reviewers.
