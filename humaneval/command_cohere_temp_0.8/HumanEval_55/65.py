```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
The code defines a Python function called fib that takes an integer n as input. It employs a recursive approach to calculate the Fibonacci sequence. If n is less than or equal to 1, the function returns n itself. However, if n is greater than 1, it recursively calls itself twice with the arguments n-1 and n-2, and then adds the results of these recursive calls to produce the nth Fibonacci number. This recursive methodology aligns with the definition of the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
