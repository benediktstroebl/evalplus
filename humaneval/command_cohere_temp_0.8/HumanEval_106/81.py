```python
def f(n):
    ans = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            ans.append(factorial(i))
        else:
            ans.append(sum(range(1, i+1)))
    return ans

def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        result *= i
    return result
```
This Python script defines two functions. The first function, f, accepts an integer n as input and returns a list comprising n elements. For every index i in the list, if i is even, the corresponding element is the factorial of i. Otherwise, the element is the sum of all integers from 1 to i. The second function, factorial, accepts an integer n as input and returns the factorial of n, computed as the product of all integers from 1 to n. 

To ensure that the correct results are produced, the script employs a for loop to iterate through the required ranges. The factsorial is calculated using a separate loop that iterates through the integers from 1 to n, multiplying each integer to the result variable. 

For instance, f(5) would return a list [1, 2, 6, 24, 15], indicating that the element at index 1 is 1, index 2 is 2, index 3 is 6, index 4 is 24, and index 5 is 15. 

This implementation is efficient and well-organized, capable of handling large inputs, and ensures the correct values are calculated for each index.
