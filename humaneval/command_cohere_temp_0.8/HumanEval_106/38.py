Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def f(n):
    ans = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            ans.append(factorial(i))
        else:
            ans.append(sum(range(1, i+1)))
    return ans

def factorial(n):
    num = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        num *= i
    return num
```
This script defines a function 'f' that takes an input 'n', and returns a list based on the given markdown specification. It also includes a nested function 'factorial' to calculate the factorial of a given number. 

You can test this function by calling 'f' with different values and verifying that the produced list conforms to the described behavior. 
For example:
```python
print(f(5))  # Output: [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
``` 
This will print the list where the element at index `i(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)` is the factorial of `i(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)` if `i` is even (`1, 2, 6, 24`, `120`) or the sum of numbers from `1` to `i(1, 3, 6, 10, 15)` otherwise.  This conforms to the provided example in the markdown specification.
