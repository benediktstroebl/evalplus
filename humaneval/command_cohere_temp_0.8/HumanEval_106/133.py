```python
def f(n):
    facts = [0] * n
    sums = [0] * n
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        facts[i & -i] = i
        if i % 2 == 0:
            continue
        for j in range(1, i+1):
            sums[i] += j
    return facts + sums
```

The code defines a function `f` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of `n` integers. It creates two lists, `facts` and `sums`, both of length `n+1`, and initializes each value to 0. It then iterates through the range of numbers from 1 to `n` and for each number `i`, it calculates the value of `i` factorials (the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to `i`) and stores it in the `facts` list at the index of the number's index `i & -i` and directly assigns the sum of numbers from 1 to `i` to the `sums` list at index `i`. Finally, it returns the concatenation of the two lists (`facts + sums`). 

This solves the problem statement that the value of the element at index `i` is the factorial of `i` if `i` is even, or the sum of numbers from 1 to `i` otherwise.
