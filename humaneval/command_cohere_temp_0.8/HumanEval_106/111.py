This script defines the `f` function that satisfies the conditions of the given problem statement. It returns a list where the even indices are filled with their corresponding factorials and the odd indices are filled with the sum of numbers from 1 to that index. The `factorial` function is also provided to calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion. Finally, the code tests the `f` function with three different input sizes to make sure the produced results match the expected outcomes.  It can be reused as a base for similar problems that involve factorial or summation operations.
