Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def f(n):
    out = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            out.append(factorial(i))
        else:
            out.append(sum(range(1, i+1)))
    return out

def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        result *= i
    return result
```
This script defines a function 'f' that takes an input 'n', and returns a list based on the given conditions. It also includes a separate function 'factorial' to calculate the factorial of a given number, which is used in the 'f' function. The 'f' function first creates an empty list 'out' and then iterates through numbers from 1 to 'n' (exclusive). For each number 'i', it checks if it's even or odd. If 'i' is even, it appends the factorial of 'i' to the list, calculated using the 'factorial' function. If 'i' is odd, it appends the sum of numbers from 1 to 'i' to the list. Finally, it returns the list 'out'.
