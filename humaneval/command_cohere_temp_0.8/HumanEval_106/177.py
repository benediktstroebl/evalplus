```python
def f(n):
    li = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            li.append(factorial(i))
        else:
            li.append(sum(range(1, i+1)))
    return li

def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        result *= i
    return result
```
The `f` function uses the factorial function to generate the list according to the given problem description. This code provides an elegant and efficient solution to the problem. 
I've also included the `factorial` function to calculate the factorial of a given number, as it's a crucial part of the solution. 
To see the code in action, you can call the `f` function with any `n` value, and it will return a list as specified in the problem.  For example:
```python
print(f(5))  # Output: [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
```
Feel free to experiment with different input values to test the function's behavior. 
This solution should provide a clear and functional implementation of the described problem. If needed, the code can be adjusted to improve its readability or optimize its performance even further.  Let me know if you would like to discuss any aspect of it in more detail!
