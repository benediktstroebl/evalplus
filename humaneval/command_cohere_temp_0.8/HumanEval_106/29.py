```python
def f(n):
    li = [0] * n
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            li[i-1] = factorial(i)
        else:
            li[i-1] = sum(range(1, i+1))
    return li

def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        result *= i
    return result
```
This Python script defines two functions. The first function, f, accepts an integer n as input and returns a list populated with results based on the provided problem statement. The second function, factorial, calculates the factorial of a given number using a loop. 

To understand the logic behind the first function, it's essential to break it down:
1. A list li is initialized with n empty slots, where n is the input value.
2. The function utilizes a for loop to traverse through numbers from 1 to n, and for each number, it checks if it's even or odd to determine the value of the corresponding index in the list.
3. If the number is even, the index slot in the list is set to the factorial of that number, calculated using the factorial function.
4. If the number is odd, the index slot is set to the sum of numbers from 1 to that number. This summation is also calculated using the range function.

Therefore, the result is a list of n elements, where each element corresponds to the description in the problem statement.
