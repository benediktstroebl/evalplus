```python
def f(n):
    ans = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            ans.append(factorial(i))
        else:
            ans.append(sum(range(1, i+1)))
    return ans

def factorial(n):
    num = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        num *= i
    return num
```
This script defines two functions:
1. The `f` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list where the element at index `i` is the factorial of `i` if `i` is even, or the sum of numbers from 1 to `i` otherwise. This is achieved using a for loop that iterates through numbers from 1 to `n`, and for each number, it decides whether to compute the factorial or the sum based on its parity and appends it to the `ans` list. 
 2. The `factorial` function computes the factorial of a given number `n` by multiplying `n` by all numbers from 1 to `n` (`n-1`). This is achieved using another for loop that multiplies the `num` variable by each number from 1 to `n`. The `num` variable is initially set to 1 and gets multiplied by each number in the for loop. 

The `f` function is then tested with a few cases to ensure its behavior matches the described problem.
