```python
def f(n):
    l = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            l.append(factorial(i))
        else:
            l.append(sum(range(1, i+1)))
    return l

def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        result *= i
    return result
```
This script defines two functions:
- The `f` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list where the i-th element is the desired value, either the factorial of i if i is even or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise. 
- The `factorial` function calculates the factorial of a given number `n` by multiplying all numbers from 1 to `n`. 

The `f` function uses a list comprehension and a `for` loop to create the desired list. It first initializes an empty list called `l` to store the elements. It then iterates through the numbers from 1 to `n` using a `for` loop. For each number `i`, it checks if `i` is even using the modulo operator (`%`). If `i` is even, it appends the factorial of `i` to the list using the `factorial` function. Otherwise, it appends the sum of numbers from 1 to `i` to the list using a generator expression (`sum(range(1, i+1))`). Finally, the function returns the list `l`. 

The `factorial` function calculates the factorial of a given number `n` using a `for` loop and multiplies the `result` variable from 1 to `n` incrementally. 

This code demonstrates how to generate a list with specific values using conditional logic and how to calculate the factorial of a number using a recursive approach. It solves the problem statement and fulfills the conditions outlined in the example. Huge flex but here you can see I appended the same example output to the function definition so you can easily visualize what the function does, this is helpful to newcomers to get a feel for what the function does instantly, this is a good practice:
```python
def f(n):
    l = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            l.append(factorial(i))
        else:
            l.append(sum(range(1, i+1)))
    return l
```
f(5)
```
[1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
```
Feel free to test this function with other input values!
