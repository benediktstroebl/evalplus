```python
def f(n):
    l = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            l.append(factorial(i))
        else:
            l.append(sum(range(1, i+1)))
    return l

def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        result *= i
    return result
```
This Python script defines two functions: 'f' and 'factorial'. 'f' accepts an integer 'n' as input and returns a list where each element corresponds to the value at index 'i' in the provided problem statement. This value is calculated correctly for both even and odd 'i's. The 'factorial' function calculates the factorial of a given number 'n' by multiplying 'n' with all integers from 1 to 'n'. 

To ensure correctness, the 'factorial' function is utilized within the 'f' function to compute the factorial for even index 'i' values, and the 'sum' function is used to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to 'i' for odd index 'i' values.
