```python
def f(n):
    ans = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            ans.append(factorial(i))
        else:
            ans.append(sum(range(1, i+1)))
    return ans

def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        result *= i
    return result
```
This Python script defines two functions. The first function, `f`, takes an input `n` and returns a list where each element corresponds to the result of a certain condition. If the index `i` is even, the element in the list is the factorial of `i`. If `i` is odd, the element is the sum of numbers from 1 to `i`. This list is created by the `ans` variable, which is initialized empty, and the `for` loop that iterates through numbers from 1 to `n`. The `if` statement decides what to do with each index `i`, and the result is appended to the `ans` list. 

The second function, `factorial`, takes an input `n` and returns the factorial of `n`. It does this with the help of a `for` loop that iterates through numbers from 1 to `n`, and multiplies them all by `result` which is initialized to 1. 

This code is self-contained as it does not rely on any external variables or data, and it defines all necessary functions to pass the given tests. It can be executed directly to produce the desired results.
