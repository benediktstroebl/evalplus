Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def f(n):
    li = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            li.append(factorial(i))
        else:
            li.append(sum(range(1, i+1)))
    return li

def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        result *= i
    return result
```
The `f` function uses two loops: the outer loop iterates across values from 1 to `n` (`n` is the argument passed to the `f` function). For each even value of `i`, the inner `factorial` loop is executed, and the corresponding element in the list being constructed is set to the factorial of `i`. For each odd value of `i`, the `sum` loop is executed, and the sum of numbers from 1 to `i` is calculated, which corresponds to the value of the element being added to the list. 

The `factorial` function calculates the factorial of `n` by iterating through all the numbers from 1 to `n` and multiplying them element-wise with the `result` variable, which starts at 1.

Both the `f` and `factorial` functions are self-contained and do not rely on any external variables or functions. Therefore, the given code block satisfies the criteria you specified.
