```python
def f(n):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the final result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through the values from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # If the value is even, calculate the factorial of i
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result.append(factorial(i))
        # If the value is odd, calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to i
        else:
            result.append(sum(range(1, i + 1)))
    
    # Return the final list of results
    return result

def factorial(n):
    # Initialize the result to 1
    result = 1
    
    # Iterate through the values from 2 to n
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # Multiply the previous result by the current number
        result *= i
    
    # Return the final factorial result
    return result
```

Let's break down the code step by step:
1. `def f(n): ... return result`: This defines the function `f` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list containing the calculated values as described in the prompt.
2. `result = []`: This initializes an empty list called `result` to store the final output.
3. `for i in range(1, n+1):`: This loop iterates through the numbers from 1 to `n`.
4. `if i % 2 == 0: ... else: ...` : This conditional checks whether the current number `i` is even (i.e., divisible by 2). If it is, the factorial of `i` is calculated and appended to the `result` list. If it's odd, the sum of numbers from 1 to `i` is calculated and appended instead.
5. `return result`: After iterating through all values, the function returns the final list of results.
6. `def factorial(n): ... return result`: This defines a helper function `factorial` to calculate the factorial of a given number `n` recursively.
7. `result = 1`: Initializes the result variable for the factorial calculation. 
8. `for i in range(2, n+1):`: This loop iterates through numbers from 2 to `n` to calculate the factorial.
9. `result *= i`: Multiplies the current number `i` with the accumulated result. 
10. `return result`: After iterating through all numbers, the function returns the final factorial value. 

This code demonstrates a clear separation of concerns by defining a helper function `factorial` to handle the factorial calculation and the main function `f` to execute the broader problem statement. This approach enhances readability, modularity, and reusability.

Note that the code assumes that the underlying system and Python interpreter support the `range` function and its behavior matches the specification. 

Let me know if you would like further clarification on any section of the code or kindly provide any additional feedback on how this can be improved. I strive to provide comprehensive and explanatory responses.
