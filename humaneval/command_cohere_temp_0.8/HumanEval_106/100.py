Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
def f(n):
    ans = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            ans.append(factorial(i))
        else:
            ans.append(sum(range(1, i+1)))
    return ans

def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        result *= i
    return result
```
The function f takes an integer n as input and creates a list of size n where the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even, or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise. The factorial of i is calculated by the factorial function.

The Python script defines the recursive function f(n) that constructs the list according to the specification. This function takes an additional parameter n, which denotes the length of the list. It uses a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to n and creates a list element by element. The construction of each list element relies on the parity of its index: for an odd index i, it calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to i, and for an even index i, it calculates the factorial of i and assigns it to the list. The factorial is computed using the recursive factorial function. Once the list is created, f(n) returns it. 

This solution uses a deterministic algorithm and has a time complexity of O(n) since it iterates through numbers from 1 to n and performs a constant-time operation on each. Thus, it is efficient and capable of meeting the expectations of the problem statement.
