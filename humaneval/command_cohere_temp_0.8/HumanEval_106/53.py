```python
def f(n):
    ans = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            ans.append(factorial(i))
        else:
            ans.append(sum(range(1, i+1)))
    return ans

def factorial(n):
    num = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        num *= i
    return num
```
This Python script defines two functions. The first function, `f`, takes an input `n` and returns a list where the element at index `i` is the factorial of `i` if `i` is even, or the sum of numbers from 1 to `i` otherwise. This list is created by the second function, `factorial`, which takes an input `n` and returns the factorial of `n`. 

And indeed, if we run the following command to test the script:
```python
assert f(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
```
the test will pass.

If you need any modifications to the code to accommodate for other tests or questions regarding the implementation, let me know!
