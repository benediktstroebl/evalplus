```python
def string_sequence(n):
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to including n."""
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n + 1)))

# Tests
def test_string_sequence():
    assert string_sequence(0) == '0'
    assert string_sequence(5) == '0 1 2 3 4 5'
    assert string_sequence(10) == '0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10'

test_string_sequence()
```

To ensure our function stays flexible and robust, we've added a test suite to validate its performance across diverse scenarios. In the event that you wish to adapt this function to accommodate different separator characters or starting numbers, the existing test suite will aid you in verifying that the functionality remains intact, thus facilitating a seamless transition amidst changes.
