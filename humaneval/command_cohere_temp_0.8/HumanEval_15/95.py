```python
def string_sequence(n):
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to including n."""
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n + 1)))

# Tests
print(string_sequence(0))
```
The above code uses the `range()` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive) and the `map()` function to convert these numbers into strings, and finally the `join()` function to concatenate these strings with spaces in between. 

The example usage in the docstring and the test at the bottom demonstrate the correct behavior for the `string_sequence` function. When `n` is 0, it returns a string `0` and when `n` is 5, it returns the string `0 1 2 3 4 5`.
