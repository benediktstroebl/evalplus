```python
def string_sequence(n):
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to including n."""
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n+1)))
```

This script defines a Python function called `string_sequence` that takes in a single argument `n`, representing a positive integer. This function generates and returns a string containing a sequence of numbers starting from 0, up to and including the given number `n`, all separated by single spaces. It achieves this by using the `range` function to generate an iterable of numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive) and then uses the `join` method to convert this iterable into a single string, with each number converted to a string using `str()`. 

Here is an example of using this function with a number `n` equal to `5`:
```python
print(string_sequence(5)) 
```

This would output the following result:
```
0 1 2 3 4 5 
``` 

This function is designed to create a sequence of numbers in text format, which can be useful for various purposes, such as generating demonstrative or instructional prompts in an application, like in the example you provided in your original message.
