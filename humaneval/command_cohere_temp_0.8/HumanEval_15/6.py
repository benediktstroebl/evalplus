```python
def string_sequence(n):
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    """
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n+1)))

# Tests
assert string_sequence(0) == '0'
assert string_sequence(5) == '0 1 2 3 4 5'
```

This code snippet includes a function called `string_sequence` that takes an integer argument `n`. The function utilizes the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive), and the `map` function to convert these numbers to strings. Then, the `join` function is used to concatenate these strings into one string, separated by spaces. 

The function is encapsulated with a docstring that provides clarity on its purpose, as well as example usage. Additionally, the code snippet includes assert statements that verify the correctness of the function for the given examples; they serve as tests to ensure the function behaves as expected.
