```python
def string_sequence(n):
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to including n."""
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n+1)))
```

This script defines a Python function called `string_sequence` that takes in a single argument `n`, which is an integer. The function returns a string containing a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to (and including) the input value `n`. The numbers are separated by single spaces.

The `string_sequence` function uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive) and the `map` function to convert each number in the sequence to a string. The `join` function is then used to concatenate the string values into a single string, separated by spaces.

This solution assumes that the input value `n` is a valid integer. If the input is not a valid integer, the function may raise a `TypeError` or return an invalid string.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```python
print(string_sequence(5))  # Output: "0 1 2 3 4 5"
```

The docstring of the function describes the expected behavior and provides example usage, which aligns with the problem statement at the beginning of this conversation.  This Python script efficiently solves the problem and produces the required string output.  It can be used as a standalone function in other scripts or imported as a module to be used in other Python files.  It can also be modified to customize the separation character or to handle a sequence length input.
