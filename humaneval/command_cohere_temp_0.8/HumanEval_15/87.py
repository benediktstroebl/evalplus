```python
def string_sequence(n):
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to including n."""
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n + 1)))

# Tests
print(string_sequence(0))
print(string_sequence(5))
```

This script defines a function called `string_sequence` which takes an integer value `n` as input and returns a string that contains a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to including `n`, separated by spaces. The `range(n+1)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive), and the `map(str, range(n+1))` function converts each number in the sequence to a string. The join function then concatenates the strings together to form the final result. 

The example usage at the bottom demonstrates the output of the function for the input values of 0 and 5, which are respectively "0" and "0 1 2 3 4 5".
