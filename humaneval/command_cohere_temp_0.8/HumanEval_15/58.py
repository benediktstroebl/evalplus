```python
def string_sequence(n):
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    """
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n+1)))
```

This straightforward Python script defines a function called `string_sequence`, which accepts a single argument `n`, an integer denoting the maximum number to be included in the sequence. The function leverages the `range` generator, which produces sequential numbers starting from 0 up to `n`, and the `map` function to transform these numbers into strings. To organize these strings for readability, the function employs `join` to concatenate them with spaces, producing a neat space-delimited sequence. 

The function then returns this formatted string. Given the comments included within the function, users can readily understand its purpose and behavior, ensuring its reusability and maintainability. 

The script readily passes the provided tests:
```python
def test_string_sequence():
    assert string_sequence(0) == '0'
    assert string_sequence(5) == '0 1 2 3 4 5'
    assert string_sequence(10) == '0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10'

test_string_sequence()
```

Overall, the code provides an efficient solution to generate string sequences of numbers up to a specified limit `n`, offering a clear and concise manner for handling this problem.
