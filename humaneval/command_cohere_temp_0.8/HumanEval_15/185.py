```python
def string_sequence(n):
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    """
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n+1)))
```

This straightforward Python script defines a function called `string_sequence`, which accepts a single argument, `n`, an integer representing the maximum number to be included in the sequence. The function uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive) using the `n+1` parameter. It converts each number in this sequence to a string using `str`, and then joins these strings together with spaces using `join`. The result is a string that represents a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n` separated by spaces. 

This solution is optimized for efficiency and code simplicity, achieving the stated problem goal without any additional complexity or redundancy.

Here are some example function calls to illustrate its behavior:
```python
string_sequence(0)  # Output: '0'
string_sequence(5)  # Output: '0 1 2 3 4 5'
string_sequence(10)  # Output: '0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10'
```
