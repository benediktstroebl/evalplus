```python
def string_sequence(n):
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    """
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n+1)))
```

This straightforward Python script defines a function called `string_sequence`, which accepts a single argument 'n', an integer representing the maximum number to be included in the sequence. The function leverages the `range` function to generate an array of numbers from 0 to 'n' inclusive, and the `join` method to concatenate these numbers into a single string with spaced-delimeters. 

The function comments provide an overview of the process and includeinline docstrings that describe the purpose of the function, as well as example usage outputs for scenarios where 'n' is 0 and 5, respectively. 

If the goal is to validate the correctness of the function, considering adding tests using a framework like 'unittest' or 'pytest'. These tests could encompass a diverse range of 'n' values and confirm that the produced output aligns expected results. 

Should there be any questions relating to the function's usage, or desire to delve deeper into any particular aspect of the script, don't hesitate to ask!
