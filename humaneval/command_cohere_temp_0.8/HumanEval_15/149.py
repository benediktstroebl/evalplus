```python
def string_sequence(n):
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    """
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n+1)))
```

This version of the code uses Python's built-in `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers up to `n` and then maps these to strings using `str`, before joining these with spaces using `join`. The result is a single string containing the desired space-delimited numbers. 

To complement the function, let's also include a few test cases that can be used to validate the correctness of the solution, formatted as a Markdown code block:
```python
import unittest

class TestStringSequence(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_zero(self):
        self.assertEqual(string_sequence(0), '0')

    def test_five(self):
        self.assertEqual(string_sequence(5), '0 1 2 3 4 5')

    def test_ten(self):
        self.assertEqual(string_sequence(10), '0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10')
```

In the test suite, each individual test is encapsulated within a `test_xxx` method, where `xxx` denotes the specific case under examination. The `assertEqual` method is then used to compare the output of the `string_sequence` function against the expected result for each test case. 

Should you wish to evaluate the script, you can do so using the Python unittest framework, like so:
```bash
python -m unittest test_string_sequence.py
```

This will execute the test suite and provide feedback on whether the function's implementations align with the expected behavior for each test case.
