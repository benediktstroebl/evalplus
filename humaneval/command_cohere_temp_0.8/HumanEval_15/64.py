```python
def string_sequence(n):
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive. """
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n+1)))

# Tests
assert string_sequence(0) == '0'
assert string_sequence(5) == '0 1 2 3 4 5'
``` 

This code snippet includes a function called `string_sequence` which takes an integer argument `n`. This function creates a string of numbers starting from 0 up to (`and including`) `n` using the `range` generator and converts these numbers to strings using the `map` function. The joined strings are separated by spaces. The function is encapsulated with a docstring that provides clarity and insight into its purpose and behavior.

Furthermore, the code snippet includes a testing section that verifies the function's correctness against two scenarios: testing with `0` and `5` as inputs. Using the `assert` statement, it validates that the actual result of the function corresponds to the expected result.
