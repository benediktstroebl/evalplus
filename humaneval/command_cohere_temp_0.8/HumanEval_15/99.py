```python
def string_sequence(n):
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to including n."""
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n+1)))
```

This straightforward Python script defines a function called `string_sequence`, which accepts a single integer argument and outputs a string containing all the numbers up to and including the provided integer. It leverages Python's `range` function to generate an array of numbers from 0 to `n` and then uses `str` and `join` to convert and concatenate these numbers into a single string, ensuring the numbers are delimited by spaces.

Here is an example of how to use this function and its output:
```python
print(string_sequence(3))  # Outputs: 0 1 2
```

This method provides a quick and efficient way to create a string of numbers beginning with 0 and ending with a provided integer, offering a versatile solution for various numeric string requirements.
