```python
def string_sequence(n):
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to including n."""
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n+1)))

# Tests
assert string_sequence(0) == '0'
assert string_sequence(5) == '0 1 2 3 4 5'
```

This code snippet solves the problem using a generator expression in conjunction with the `join` method to convert the sequence of numbers into a string. And the tests ensure the function behaves as expected. Let's go through it step by step and explain each part:

1. **Function Definition**:  
```python
def string_sequence(n):
```
   This line starts by defining a new function named `string_sequence` that takes a single argument `n`, which is of type `int`. This function is designed to solve the problem statement and return a string containing a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive) separated by spaces.

2. **Implementation**:  
```python
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n+1)))
```
   This is the core of the function where the magic happens. It uses some advanced Python concepts to generate the desired string. Let's break it down:
   - `map(str, range(n+1))`: This part uses the `map` function to apply the `str` function to each item in the `range` generator expression. The `range` function generates numbers sequentially, and `n+1` ensures the last number generated is `n`. This produces a sequence of strings representing the numbers.

   - `' '.join(...)`: The `join` method is then applied to the sequence of strings generated by `map`. It takes the elements of the sequence and joins them together into a single string, separating them with the provided delimiter, which in this case is a space. The result is a string that concatenates the numbers with spaces in between.

3. **Assertions**:  
```python
assert string_sequence(0) == '0'
assert string_sequence(5) == '0 1 2 3 4 5'
```
   These lines contain tests to validate the correctness of the `string_sequence` function. The `assert` statement checks whether the function's output matches the expected output for the given inputs. In this case, it checks whether the function returns the correct string when `n` is 0 and 5, respectively.

The tests assert the function's correctness in producing the desired string sequence for the given input values.
