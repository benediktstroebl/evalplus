```python
def string_sequence(n):
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    """
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n+1)))
```

This script defines a Python function called `string_sequence`, which takes in a single argument `n`, representing a positive integer. This function returns a string that contains a sequence of numbers from 0 up to (and including) `n`, separated by spaces.

The purpose of this function is to provide a concise way to create a string that represents a range of numbers. Such a sequence can be directly used for various purposes, such as displaying a progression of numbers or providing an input list for testing or analysis tasks.

Here are some specific examples of this function in action:
```python
string_sequence(0)  # Output: "0"
string_sequence(5)  # Output: "0 1 2 3 4 5"
string_sequence(10) # Output: "0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"
```

This approach uses Python's `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers up to the specified `n`, converts these numbers to strings using `map`, and then joins these elements into a single string with spaces as separators. The resulting `string_sequence` function is both efficient and easy to use. 

If you need to tailor the sequence's formatting, such as adding separators other than spaces or excluding elements from the sequence, you can do so by modifying the function as needed.
