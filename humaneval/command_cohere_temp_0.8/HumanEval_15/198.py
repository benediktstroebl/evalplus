```python
def string_sequence(n):
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to including n."""
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n+1)))
```

This problem can be solved using the built-in `range()` function in Python which creates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to including `n` (the parameter specified by the function). The `map()` function is then used to convert these sequence numbers into strings and `join()` to join these strings into one string separated by spaces.

The `range()` function and the string `map()` function provide an elegant solution for this task, eliminating the need for a loop-based approach. 

This function can be tested with:
```python
# test the function with various inputs
print(string_sequence(0))  # expected output: 0
print(string_sequence(5))  # expected output: 0 1 2 3 4 5
print(string_sequence(10))  # expected output: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

The code snippet above verifies the correctness of the `string_sequence()` function for different input values. In particular, it checks whether the function returns the correct input for three specific inputs (`0`, `5`, `10`). The function is expected to return a string containing space-separated numbers beginning from 0 and ending at the input value. 

The expected output for the three calls to the function is '0', '0 1 2 3 4 5', and '0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10' respectively.  This approach allows the tester to validate the behavior of the function across different input values.
