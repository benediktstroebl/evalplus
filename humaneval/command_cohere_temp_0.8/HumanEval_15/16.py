```python
def string_sequence(n):
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to including n."""
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n+1)))
```

This provides a precise and efficient answer to the problem statement with the added clarity of a docstring. The original example provided an efficient and simple solution by employing Python's built-in range() and str() functions in conjunction with the join() method to concatenate the sequence of numbers into a single string.
