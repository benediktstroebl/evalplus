```python
def string_sequence(n):
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    """
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n+1)))
```

This straightforward Python script defines a function called `string_sequence`, which accepts a single argument 'n', an integer representing a target number. The purpose of this function is to generate and return a string consisting of numbers starting from 0, ending at 'n', and incrementing by 1 at each step. Essentially, it's a formatted string representation of the range from 0 to 'n' inclusive.

To achieve this, the function leverages Python's powerful `range` and `map` functionalities, complemented by the `str` module. Specifically, `range(n+1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 'n', and `map(str, range(n+1))` transforms each number in this sequence into a string version using the `str` function. These string representations are then joined together with spaces using `join`, resulting in a single string.

The function is designed to handle any valid integer provided for 'n'. For example, when calling `string_sequence(5)`, it will output "0 1 2 3 4 5". This output range reflects the function's ability to accommodate any specified number and provide a corresponding sequence of numbers up to, and including, the given input.
