This script defines the `string_sequence()` function, as described in the prompt. The function uses the `range()` and `map()` functions to generate numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive) and convert them to strings, respectively. It then uses `join()` to concatenate these strings into a single string separated by spaces. The output of the function is then tested using the `test_string_sequence()` function, which validates the output of `string_sequence()` for different input values. 

This code passes the test cases provided in the prompt and should also work for larger values of `n`.  It can be tested on the command line by calling the `string_sequence()` function with different inputs.
