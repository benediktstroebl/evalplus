```python
def string_sequence(n):
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    """
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n+1)))
```

This script defines a function called `string_sequence`, which takes an integer argument `n`. The function utilizes the `range` and `str` modules to generate a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to (and including) `n`. The `map` function is then used to convert these numbers to strings, and the `join` function concatenates these strings into one string, separated by spaces.

The function's description provides a clear explanation of its purpose and behavior, which is useful for understanding. The example usage showcases the function's behavior for different input values, providing insight into its expected output. Overall, the function appears to be correctly implemented and efficiently solves the problem described in the prompt.
