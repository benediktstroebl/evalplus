This script includes a function `string_sequence(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to including `n`. The script also includes a list of test cases with input values and expected outputs that are used to verify the correct functionality of the function. 

To validate the function, the code loops over the test cases and for each test case, it compares the output of the `string_sequence` function with the expected output. Thus, if the output matches the expected output for all test cases, the function `string_sequence` is considered working accurately. 

 Feel free to add more test cases to cover a broader range of scenarios or to modify the function to accommodate alternative formatting requests.
