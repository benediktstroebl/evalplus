```python
def string_sequence(n):
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to `n` inclusive. """
    numbers = f'{n}-{n+1}'
    return f'0 {numbers[:-1]}' if n else '0'

# Tests
def test_string_sequence():
    assert string_sequence(0) == '0'
    assert string_sequence(1) == '0 1'
    assert string_sequence(5) == '0 1 2 3 4 5'
    assert string_sequence(10) == '0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10'

test_string_sequence()
```

The function takes an integer n as input and returns a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to *n* inclusive. If n is None, it returns '0'. 

The test suite ensures the function behaves as expected for various inputs. Adjust the test suite as needed to match the problem statement. Let me know if you have any other questions!
