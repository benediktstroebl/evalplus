The provided code snippet includes a test suite with test cases that validate the behaviour of the `string_to_md5` function against expected outputs. This test suite can be expanded to ensure the function's correctness under different scenarios and edge cases, such as long strings, empty strings, and various types of input texts.

This solution avoids the need to import the `hashlib` module externally and is therefore more efficient and self-contained. which makes the code more self-sufficient and easier to deploy in various contexts.  The tests ensure the function's behaviour aligns with the problem statement's expectations.
