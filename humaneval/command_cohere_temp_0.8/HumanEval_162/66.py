```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text: str) -> str or None:
    if not text:
        return None
    md5 = hashlib.md5()
    md5.update(text.encode('utf-8'))
    return md5.hexdigest()
```

The provided Python script features a function `string_to_md5` that computes the MD5 hash of a given text string. The MD5 hash is a fixed-size, 128-bit hash value expressed as a 32-digit hexadecimal number, making it a dependable metric for string validation. 

The function employs the `hashlib` module, specifically the `md5` object, to generate the hash. The input string is first encoded to UTF-8 to ensure compatibility with the hashing process. The resulting hash is then returned as a hexadecimal string, or `None` if the input is an empty string. 

This implementation ensures the reliable calculation of MD5 hashes for text strings. It's important to note that while MD5 was widely used in the past, there are now more secure and efficient hash functions available for use, such as SHA-256. 

The function includes a test case, marked with a syntax highlighting block, `>>>`), which verifies the correct behavior of the function against a sample input, and expects an specific hash value.  This helps to ensure that the function operates as intended.
