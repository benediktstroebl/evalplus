```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text: str) -> str or None:
    """
    Return the MD5 hash of the input text as a string, or None if the input is empty.
    """
    if text and text.strip():
        return hashlib.md5(text.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
    else:
        return None
```

The provided Python function uses the `hashlib` module to calculate the MD5 hash of the input `text`. The MD5 hash is a unique string representation of a given text. The function checks if the input is empty or contains only whitespace before calling the MD5 hash function to avoid raising a `ValueError` for empty inputs. The function returns `None` if the input is empty, and the MD5 hash otherwise. Ensure that you have the `hashlib` module available when using this script, typically included in Python's standard library. 

The test case provided in the problem statement can be replaced with a more comprehensive test strategy to exercise different scenarios. 

Let's break down the purpose of each section in the MD5 hash function:
1. `import hashlib`: Importing the `hashlib` module provides access to the built-in MD5 hash function in Python. 
2. `def string_to_md5(text: str) -> str or None:`: This defines a function named `string_to_md5` that takes a single argument `text` (which is expected to be a string) and returns a string or NoneType.
3. `if text and text.strip():`: This checks two conditions using the logical operator `and`:
    - `text`: Checks if the variable `text` is not empty. 
    - `text.strip()`: Calls the `strip()` method on the `str` object to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces. This is used to account for inputs that contain only whitespaces. 
 4. `return hashlib.md5(text.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()`: If the above conditions are met (i.e., the input text is not empty or contains only whitespaces), this block is executed. 
    - `hashlib.md5(text.encode('utf-8'))`: This calculates the MD5 hash of the input `text`. The `encode('utf-8')` method converts the `str` to an `bytes` object, allowing the MD5 hash function to operate on it. 
    - `.hexdigest()`: This method returns the hexadecimal representation of the calculated hash value.
5. `else:`: This block is executed if the input `text` is empty or contains only whitespaces. 
    - `return None`: The function returns `None` in such cases. 

Additionally, the `string_to_md5` function includes a docstring, which provides a brief description of its purpose, inputs, and outputs. This docstring is helpful for understanding the function's functionality without needing to inspect the implementation details. 

Overall, the provided code incorporates safeguards against processing empty or all-whitespace inputs and ensures consistency in handling such cases by returning `None`. 

To efficiently utilize this script in your application, ensure you handle the returned MD5 hashes and evaluate their uniqueness appropriately based on your requirements.
