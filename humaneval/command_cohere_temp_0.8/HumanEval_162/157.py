```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text: str) -> str or None:
    """
    Return the MD5 hash of the input text as a string, or None if the input is empty.
    """
    if text and text.strip():
        return hashlib.md5(text.encode()).hexdigest()
    else:
        return None
```

The provided Python function uses the `hashlib` module to calculate the MD5 hash of the input `text`. The MD5 hash is a unique fingerprint of the input text. 

The function checks if the input `text` is not empty by using the `strip` method to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces and then checks if it's empty. If the text is empty, the function returns `None`. If the text is not empty, the function returns the hexadecimal representation of the MD5 hash using the `hexdigest` method. 

To ensure robustness, the function accepts both plain strings and strings with leading or trailing whitespaces, owing to the `strip` method check. 

This approach guarantees the correctness of the MD5 hash computation and handles empty inputs effectively. 

The function documentation is also improved with the explanation of the method used and provides a concise summary of the function's action.
