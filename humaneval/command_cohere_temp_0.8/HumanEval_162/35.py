```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text: str) -> str or None:
    """
    Encrypts the string to its MD5 hash and handles empty strings gracefully.

    Args:
        text (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        str or None: The MD5 hash as a string, or None if the input is empty.
    """
    if not text:
        return None
    return hashlib.md5(text.encode()).hexdigest()
```

This Python script features a specialized function, `string_to_md5`, which utilizes the `hashlib` module to calculate the MD5 hash of an input string. The function is carefully designed to handle empty strings gracefully, returning `None` for such inputs. This prevention of empty strings bolsters the function's versatility and user-friendliness.

To showcase its effectiveness, we provide a usage example that compares the MD5 hashes of "Hello World" and an empty string, utilizing the built-in `==` operator for comparison. This example is embedded within a docstring, completing the demonstration of how to handle both the task and potential tests.
