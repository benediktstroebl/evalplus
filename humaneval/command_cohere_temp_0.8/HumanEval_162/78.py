```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text: str) -> str or None:
    if not text:
        return None
    md5 = hashlib.md5()
    md5.update(text.encode('utf-8'))
    return md5.hexdigest()
```

The provided Python function string_to_md5 computes the MD5 hash of a given text string. It uses the hashlib module in Python which provides drivers for various hash and message digest algorithms. The MD5 hash, as a hexadecimal-encoded string, is returned by the function. 

The function checks for the input parameter being empty, and accordingly returns None if it's an empty string. This adds an additional check in the function to handle edge cases where an empty string is provided as input. 

To ensure proper handling of text input, the function encodes the text in UTF-8 encoding before calculating the MD5 hash. This step is essential as MD5 hashes are typically calculated with binary data, and UTF-8 encoding ensures that the text is properly converted to a binary format before hashing. 

It's important to note that while MD5 was widely used in the past for checksums and authentication, it is now considered to be insecure for these purposes due to vulnerabilities like collision attacks. Hence, it is not recommended for use in security-sensitive applications or contexts. 

The function as provided in the code snippet above aims to simply demonstrate how the MD5 hash can be calculated using Python's hashlib module. 

Here is an example of how you can test the string_to_md5 function using the Python interpreter:
```python
>>> string_to_md5('Hello world')
'3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'

>>> string_to_md5('')
None
```

The output above demonstrates the correct operation of the `string_to_md5` function where it returns the MD5 hash of the text "Hello world" correctly, and returns None for an empty string. 

This function provides a straightforward solution in Python for converting a string to its MD5 hash, handling empty strings correctly, and assuring proper encoding of the input text.
