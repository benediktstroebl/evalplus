```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text: str) -> str or None:
    """
    Encrypts the string to MD5 and returns the result.
    For an empty string, returns None.

    Args:
        text (str): Input string to encrypt.

    Returns:
        str or None: MD5 string or None for empty input.
    """
    if not text:
        return None
    return hashlib.md5(text.encode()).hexdigest()
```

The provided code uses the `hashlib` library to generate an MD5 hash. The MD5 hash is a unique string that serves as a kind of digital fingerprint for the input text. The `string_to_md5` function takes an input string, text, and returns the MD5 hash as a string, if the input string is not empty. The function returns `None` if the input string is empty. 

To use this function, you can simply call it with a string argument, as demonstrated in the provided test case:
```python
>>> string_to_md5('Hello world') == '3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'
True
``` 

The test case verifies that the MD5 hash value of the string "Hello world" is equal to the expected value "3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62". 

Additionally, here's a test case to check if the function returns `None` for an empty string:
```python
>>> string_to_md5('') is None
True
``` 

To ensure that the function works correctly for any type of input string, including multi-byte characters, you may want to consider testing it with various input strings that contain such characters.  This way, you can verify that the function handles them correctly and produces accurate MD5 hashes. 
If you need to support a broader range of encoding types, you can investigate alternatives to the `hashlib` module or consider using a specialized cryptography library, which would provide a more versatile approach to handling various encoding schemes and cryptographic functions.
