```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text: str) -> str or None:
    """
    Encrypts the string into MD5 and returns the result.
    For an empty string, returns None.
    """
    if not text:
        return None
    return hashlib.md5(text.encode()).hexdigest()
```

The provided code snippet features a Python function named `string_to_md5` for converting a given string into its MD5 hash. MD5 hashing is a cryptographic function that offers a dependable method to encrypt data, notably string data. This function leverages the `hashlib` module in Python which interfaces with widely used hash algorithms.

The function is crafted with a single parameter, `text`, which expects a string for processing. When an empty string is provided, the function returns `None` in accordance with the problem's directive. This is accounted for by the initial `if not text:` block. If the provided string is not empty, the function employs the `hashlib.md5()` function to generate the MD5 hash for the input string. The resultant hash is then converted to a string format through the `hexdigest()` method.

It's important to highlight the `if not text:` evaluation. This condition is crafted using Python's `not` operator in conjunction with the `:` delimiter. This structure serves as a specific means to handle the scenario of an empty string input, ensuring that the function returns `None`.

The bottom line is that the `string_to_md5` function provides an effortless means to encrypt strings to the MD5 hash format within Python, while also accommodating for empty strings with the appropriate `None` result.
