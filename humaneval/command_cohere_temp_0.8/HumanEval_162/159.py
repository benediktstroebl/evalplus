```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text: str) -> str or None:
    if not text:
        return None
    md5 = hashlib.md5()
    md5.update(text.encode('utf-8'))
    return md5.hexdigest()
```

The provided Python function uses the `hashlib` module to generate an MD5 hash. It encodes the input string as UTF-8, calculates the MD5 hash, and then returns the hexadecimal representation of that hash. If the input is an empty string, it returns `None`. This method ensures that the MD5 hash is correctly generated for any string input, including non-ASCII characters, making it suitable for cryptographic applications. 

The tests for this function can be executed by calling `python -mv =` at the command line, which will run the function with different input strings and validate that the expected MD5 hashes are obtained. 

To use this function in a Python program, import it explicitly: `from hashlib import md5` and then call it with a string as follows: `result = string_to_md5("hello world")`. 

It's important to note that while MD5 was widely used for basic password authentication and checksums in the past, it isn't suitable for cryptographic applications due to vulnerabilities. More advanced and secure hash functions, like SHA-256 or SHA-3, should be preferred for any sensitive cryptographic operation. 

If you intend to use this function for any cryptographic purposes, consider using more secure algorithms, such as SHA-256 or SHA-3, for more secure hash calculations.
