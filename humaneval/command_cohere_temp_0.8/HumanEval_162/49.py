```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text: str) -> str or None:
    """
    Encrypts the string to MD5 and returns the hexadecimal representation of the hash.
    Returns None if the input is an empty string.
    """
    if text and text != "":
        md5 = hashlib.md5()
        md5.update(text.encode('utf-8'))
        return md5.hexdigest()
    else:
        return None
```

The provided Python function uses the `hashlib` module to generate an MD5 hash, which is a 128-bit hash value. The MD5 hash is unique to each unique input and is widely used for cryptographic purposes. 

The function takes one parameter, `text`, which is the string to be encrypted. The function checks if the input is not empty then it creates an MD5 hash using the `hashlib.md5()` function. It then uses the `update()` method to feed the text into the hash function, and finally, the `hexdigest()` method returns the hexadecimal representation of the hash which is then returned by the function. 

The function returns `None` if the input is an empty string, this is following the problem's instruction which states to return None if the input is an empty string. 

This Python function solves the task of converting a string to an MD5 hash and handles the edge case of empty strings as described in the problem. 

To use this function in your code, simply import it and call it with a string to hash, for example: `result = string_to_md5("Hello World")`
