```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text: str) -> str or None:
    """
    Encrypts the string to MD5 and returns the result.
    For an empty string, returns None.

    :param text: String to encrypt
    :return: MD5 encrypted string or None
    """
    if not text:
        return None
    return hashlib.md5(text.encode()).hexdigest()
```

This function uses the `hashlib` module to generate an MD5 hash, which is an encryption algorithm that generates a unique hash for any given string. The function will always return a string, but if the input is an empty string, it will return `None` instead. 

To test this function, you can use the following tests:
```python
# Test with a full string
assert string_to_md5("Hello World!") == "3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62"

# Test with an empty string
assert string_to_md5("") is None
```

These tests will ensure that the `string_to_md5` function works correctly with both empty strings and full strings. 

The code and the tests are aligned with the problem statement and the provided example in the original prompt. 

You can use this code to encrypt any string to an MD5 hash or detect if an empty string was entered.
