```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text: str) -> str or None:
    """
    Return the MD5 hash of the input text as a string,
    or None if the input is empty.
    """
    if text and text.strip():
        return hashlib.md5(text.encode()).hexdigest()
    else:
        return None
```

The provided Python function uses the `hashlib` module to compute the MD5 hash of the input `text`. It checks if the input is empty or contains only whitespace by stripping any whitespace from the input and then verifying if the resulting string is empty. If the input is empty, the function returns `None`; otherwise, it computes the MD5 hash of the input text and returns it as a string. 

The tests passed by this solution are:
- An empty string input should return None.
- A non-empty string input should return its MD5 hash as a string. 

The MD5 hash function is used to generate a unique representation of a string, and in some cases, it can be used to quickly check if two strings are equal. 

Note: MD5 is not considered secure and is vulnerable to collisions, meaning two different inputs can produce the same MD5 hash. Therefore, it should not be used for security-sensitive applications.
