```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text: str) -> str or None:
    if not text:
        return None
    md5 = hashlib.md5()
    md5.update(text.encode('utf-8'))
    return md5.hexdigest()
```

The provided Python function uses the `hashlib` module to calculate the MD5 hash of a given string. It first checks if the input `text` is empty. If empty, it returns `None` because an MD5 hash of an empty string is always blank, and it's common to treat None as a special "null" case in many programming contexts. Otherwise, it creates an MD5 hash object and updates it with the UTF-8 encoded version of the input string. Finally, it returns the hexadecimal representation of the computed MD5 hash. 

To verify the correct operation of this function, let's create a test case inspired by the given markdown code block:
```python
assert string_to_md5('Hello world') == '3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'
``` 

If you run this test, it would succeed with a boolean value of `True`, confirming the correctness of the function against the provided test case. 

This function can be embedded in a larger codebase or reused individually for specific tasks that require calculating MD5 hashes of strings, especially in scenarios where some precautions must be taken for empty inputs. 

Please note that MD5 is no longer considered a secure hash function for secure cryptographic applications due to vulnerabilities. Instead, it finds some use in checksum-based operations and other non-cryptographic purposes. 

If you're interested in exploring hash functions for cryptographic uses, more secure alternatives like SHA-256 and SHA-3 are available in the `hashlib` module and are inherently suitable for such applications.
