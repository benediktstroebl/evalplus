```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text: str) -> str or None:
    if not text:
        return None
    md5 = hashlib.md5()
    md5.update(text.encode('utf-8'))
    return md5.hexdigest()
```

The provided Python function uses the `hashlib` module to generate an MD5 hash. It encodes the input string as UTF-8, calculates the MD5 hash, and then returns the hexadecimal representation of that hash. If the input is an empty string, it returns `None`. This method ensures the integrity of the text data and provides a unique fingerprint for storage and comparison purposes. 

To use this function, run the code in the script or import the function definition into your current file and call it with the desired input text. 

Ensure that you have MD5 support enabled in your Python installation since the `hashlib` module relies on external libraries. You may need to install the `cryptography` library to provide these dependencies if they are missing on your system. 

**NOTE**: MD5 is a hash function that has been found to have security vulnerabilities for certain use cases. As a result, it is recommended to utilize more secure hash functions, such as SHA-256 or SHA-3, for security-sensitive applications. 

**Caution**: Never use MD5 for password storage, cryptographic purposes, or any other place where security against malicious attacks is a necessity.
