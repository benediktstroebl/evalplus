```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text: str) -> str or None:
    """
    Compute the MD5 hash of the given string or return None for an empty input.

    Parameters:
        text (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        str or None: The MD5 hash as a lowercase hexadecimal string, or None for empty input.
    """
    if not text:
        return None
    md5 = hashlib.md5()
    md5.update(text.encode('utf-8'))
    return md5.hexdigest().lower()
```

This Python function utilizes the `hashlib` module to compute the MD5 hash of a given string. MD5 is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit hash value. The function passes the string through the MD5 hash function, encoding it first if it contains any Unicode characters through the `utf-8` encoding method. The resulting hash is then converted to a lowercase hexadecimal string.

The function includes a test for emptiness, ensuring that it returns `None` when the input string is empty. This guards against potential errors with downstream users who may expect a result for an empty string. The function itself is designed to handle such cases, preventing potential errors when processing non-empty and empty strings differently. 

This function can be readily incorporated into larger Python programs to implement password storage, checksum validation, or other applications requiring reliable and efficient data integrity verification.
