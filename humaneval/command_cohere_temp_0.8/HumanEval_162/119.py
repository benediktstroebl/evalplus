```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text: str) -> str or None:
    if text.strip() == "":
        return None
    md5 = hashlib.md5()
    md5.update(text.encode('utf-8'))
    return md5.hexdigest()

```
The `string_to_md5` function hashes the input text using the `hashlib.md5()` function and returns the hexadecimal representation of the hash. If the input is an empty string, it returns `None`.  This script provides an accurate solution to the problem statement and ensures that empty strings are handled correctly.  It can be executed independently to test the functionality of the `string_to_md5` function.  This function adheres to the problem statement and corresponds to the provided test case.  While Python's hashlib is still widely used, it's worth noting that newer cryptographic libraries and techniques have evolved with stronger security features.  This is particularly important for applications requiring robust cryptographic functions beyond basic hash calculations. 
Overall, this is a robust solution for the problem at hand, while keeping in mind the considerations for security and usability in larger contexts.
