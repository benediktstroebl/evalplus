```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text: str) -> str or None:
    """
    Return the MD5 hash of the string text if it is not empty,
    otherwise return None.

    Args:
        text (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        str or None: The MD5 hash of the input string or None.
    """
    if text:
        return hashlib.md5(text.encode()).hexdigest()
    else:
        return None
```

The `hashlib` module is used in this method to compute the MD5 hash. The input is encoded as UTF-8 bytes using the `encode()` method. Using the `hexdigest()` method, the hash result is returned as a hexadecimal string.

An empty text will result in a call to `hashlib.md5()` returning `None`, and this value is likewise returned by the function.

This function appropriately addresses the problem statement and handles the case of an empty text. It can be executed independently and is self-contained.

You can use this function to compute the MD5 hash of any string you provide and handle situations when the text is empty. 

**NOTE:** MD5 hashing is no longer recommended for general use because of safety concerns. It is advisable to utilize another hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256, for more security. However, since the challenge requires the MD5 hashing algorithm, I STILL provide a solution using the MD5 hashlib module. Nevertheless, you would use SHA-256 in production environments for more security. 

This hashlib module and its SHA-256 equivalent are both available in Python's standard library.
