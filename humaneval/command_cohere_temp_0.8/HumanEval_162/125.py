```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text: str) -> str or None:
    if not text:
        return None
    md5 = hashlib.md5()
    md5.update(text.encode('utf-8'))
    return md5.hexdigest()
```

The provided Python function uses the `hashlib` module to calculate the MD5 hash of a given text string. The MD5 hash is a unique signature for digital messages that can be used to verify data integrity.

The function applies the MD5 hashing algorithm to the text string passed as an argument. The result is then converted to a hexadecimal string using the `hexdigest()` method. By encoding the text in UTF-8 format before hashing, the function supports a wide range of characters.

If the input text is an empty string, the function returns `None`, as specified in the problem statement.

To ensure proper hashing and avoid potential errors, the function does not perform any validation or normalization on the input text. Therefore, it's essential to provide a valid text string to the function, as any mistakes or malformed inputs will lead to unexpected results.

Overall, the function offers a straightforward and effective way to generate MD5 hashes for given text in Python, facilitating data integrity checks and other applications that rely on this hashing algorithm.
