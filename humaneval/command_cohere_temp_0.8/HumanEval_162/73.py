```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text: str) -> str or None:
    if not text:
        return None
    md5 = hashlib.md5()
    md5.update(text.encode('utf-8'))
    return md5.hexdigest()
```

The provided Python function uses the `hashlib` module to calculate the MD5 hash of a given string. It's important to note that while MD5 was widely used for checksums and authentication in the past, its security weaknesses have been discovered, and it is not suitable for secure applications. For more information, consult the MD5 security considerations. 

The function elegantly handles empty inputs by returning `None`, which aligns with the problem statement's requirement. Additionally, it encodes the input text to UTF-8, ensuring that special characters are handled correctly. The return of the hexdigest provides a string representation of the MD5 hash, making it easily comparable or usable in other contexts. 

This function could be used in other parts of your code to securely (given the limitations of MD5) verify the integrity of files, send secure tokens, and validate user inputs. Just make sure to consider other, more secure hash functions for security-sensitive tasks.
