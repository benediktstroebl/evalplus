```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text: str) -> str or None:
    """
    Return the MD5 hash of the input text as a string,
    or None if the input is empty.
    """
    if text and text.strip():
        return hashlib.md5(text.encode()).hexdigest()
    else:
        return None
```

The provided Python function uses the `hashlib` module to compute the MD5 hash of the input `text`. It checks if the input is empty or contains only whitespace by stripping any whitespace from the input and then verifying if the resulting string is empty. 

By doing this, it ensures that the input is valid and shouldn't throw any unwanted errors when hashlib.md5() is used. The function then returns the hexadecimal representation of the hash value if the input is not empty, otherwise, it returns None. 

It is important to note that MD5 is no longer considered a secure hashing algorithm due to vulnerabilities. It is recommended to use more secure and stronger hashing algorithms like SHA-256 for security-sensitive applications. However, MD5 is still usable for non-security-critical tasks like checking for string equality or as a simple checksum. 

This function is designed to be self-contained and return a string type for the MD5 hash, and None for an empty input string. It accomplishes the task without relying on external modules or functions. 

You can verify the correct operation of the function by testing it with an input string, such as "Hello World", and comparing the output with the expected MD5 hash value, which in this case would be "3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62".
