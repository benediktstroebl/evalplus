```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text: str) -> str or None:
    """
    Return the MD5 hash of the input text as a string,
    or None if the input is empty.
    """
    if text and text.strip():
        return hashlib.md5(text.encode()).hexdigest()
    else:
        return None
```

The provided Python function uses the `hashlib` module to calculate the MD5 hash of the input `text`. It first checks if the `text` is not empty or contains any whitespace using the `strips` method, and if so, it returns the MD5 hash as a hexadecimal string using the `hexdigest` method. If the input is empty or contains only whitespace, it returns `None`. This algorithm ensures the integrity of the input validation and MD5 hashing process.  This adheres to the problem statement's requirement to handle empty inputs differently and provide a useful result for non-empty inputs.  By returning `None` for empty inputs, the function provides a clear indication that no valid MD5 hash could be generated, avoiding potential issues with empty hashes.  This function is also self-contained, as it does not rely on any external variables or interactions beyond the input text, further enforcing its robustness and reliability.
