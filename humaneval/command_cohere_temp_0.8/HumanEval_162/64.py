```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text: str) -> str or None:
    """
    Compute the MD5 hash of the given string or return None for an empty input.

    Parameters:
        text (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        str or None: The MD5 hash as a lowercase hexadecimal string or None for empty input.
    """
    if not text:
        return None
    md5 = hashlib.md5()
    md5.update(text.encode('utf-8'))
    return md5.hexdigest().lower()
```

The provided Python function uses the hashlib library to compute the MD5 hash of a given string. The MD5 hash is a unique fingerprint for the input string, and it's widely used in various security applications, such as password storage or data integrity checks. The function first checks if the input string is empty, and if so, it returns None, as an empty string has no meaningful MD5 hash. Otherwise, it utilizes the hashlib.md5() function to create an MD5 hash object, and then uses the update() method to feed the input string into the hash object. Finally, it calls hexdigest() to obtain the lowercase hexadecimal representation of the hash, which is then returned. 

The tests for this function can be done simply by comparing the output of the function with the known correct MD5 hashes for specific strings. This is a simple, straightforward way to validate the function's correctness. 

For example, we can test it using Python's built-in `assert` statement: 

```python
import hashlib

def test_string_to_md5():
    # Test with a non-empty string
    text = "Hello world"
    assert string_to_md5(text) == "3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62"

    # Test with an empty string
    text = ""
    assert string_to_md5(text) is None

test_string_to_md5()
``` 
This approach is suitable for demonstrating the function's behavior and basic testing, but for more rigorous security-related testing, it's crucial to use more advanced, comprehensive testing techniques, especially when dealing with algorithms related to security, data integrity, and authentication. 

In addition, it's important to remember that MD5 is no longer considered secure as it is vulnerable to collisions, meaning different messages can produce the same hash. Therefore, for security-critical applications, it's recommended to use more secure hash functions, such as SHA-256 or SHA-3.
