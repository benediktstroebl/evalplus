```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text: str) -> str or None:
    """
    Return the MD5 hash of the input text as a string,
    or None if the input is empty.
    """
    if text and text.strip():
        return hashlib.md5(text.encode()).hexdigest()
    else:
        return None
```

The provided Python function uses the `hashlib` module to calculate the MD5 hash of the input `text`. It first checks if the `text` is not empty or contains whitespace by using the `if text and text.strip():` condition. If the text is empty or contains only whitespace, it returns `None`. If the text is valid, the function uses the `hashlib.md5()` function to calculate the MD5 hash of the text and returns it as a hexadecimal string using `hexdigest()`}. 

The `strip()` method used in the validation is a robust way to check if the string contains any non-whitespace characters since it removes trailing and leading whitespace and delivers a boolean value indicating whether any characters were removed. 

This approach provides a clear and concise implementation that solves the problem statement and reflects good coding practices. Let me know if it suits your needs! I can also provide comments and explain the code if needed.
