```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text: str) -> str or None:
    if not text:
        return None
    md5 = hashlib.md5()
    md5.update(text.encode('utf-8'))
    return md5.hexdigest()
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `string_to_md5` that takes a string text as input. Within the function, it checks if the input text is empty using the condition `if not text:`. If the text is empty, the function returns `None` indicating that the input string cannot be converted to an MD5 hash. Otherwise, it proceeds to compute the MD5 hash of the input text. 

To do this, it uses the `hashlib` module in Python which provides developers with a way to create hash objects. In this case, it creates an instance of the MD5 hash algorithm using `md5 = hashlib.md5()`. 

After creating the MD5 object, it updates the hash object with the text encoded in UTF-8 format using the `update()` method. This step is crucial to compute the hash value of the text. Finally, the function returns the hexadecimal representation of the hash value using the `hexdigest()` method. 

The purpose of the MD5 hash, a cryptographic protocol, is to take any given string and produce a unique, fixed-length string representation. It's commonly used as a checksum to verify data integrity and is not suitable for cryptographic purposes due to vulnerabilities. 

It's important to note that while this function provides a working implementation of MD5 hashing in Python, for more secure and robust operations, it's recommended to use more secure hashing algorithms like SHA-256 or Argon2. 

The script includes a test case that verifies if the function behaves as expected. Specifically, it checks if the MD5 hash of the string "Hello world" is equal to the expected hash value "3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62". The equals (`==`) operator is used for comparison. The test case uses the `>>>` prompt, which is typically used in Python to denote interactive terminal-based testing or validation. 

Finally, the script overall presents a concise and self-contained solution to the problem of converting a given string to its MD5 hash equivalent, handling the edge case where the input string is empty.
