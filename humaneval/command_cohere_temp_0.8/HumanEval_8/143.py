```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """ For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
    (10, 24)
    """
    if not numbers:
        return (0, 1)
    return (sum(numbers), prod(numbers))


def prod(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    """Returns the product of integers in the list."""
    result = 1
    for number in numbers:
        result *= number
    return result
```

The `prod` helper function is introduced to ensure readability and encapsulation. It calculates the product of a list of integers. This code is appended with automated tests for the `sum_product` function that verifies both the sum and product operations. 

The tests are defined using the `>>> `token in the comments, which are not part of the Python syntax but are commonly used in Python code blocks to signify test expectations. These tests are executed when the script is run. 
For the code to work, you need to have the `typing` module imported as it is used for the type hinting of the returned and parameter types. Also, the Python interpreter needs to have the `unittest` module imported in order to run the tests. Usually, when running the tests via a script, this is done via the `test` module in the following way: 
```bash
python -m unittest test.py
``` 
This way, the module automatically recognizes the test cases and runs them.  It is not necessary to manually import the `unittest` when running the script in an interactive Python session.
