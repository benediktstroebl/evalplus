# Tests:
empty_list = []
assert sum_product(empty_list) == (0, 1)

list_ = [1, 2, 3, 4]
assert sum_product(list_) == (10, 24)

another_list = [2, 4, 6, 8]

```

In the code provided, the `sum_product` function takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the sum and the product of the integers in the list. The `prod` function is used to calculate the product of the numbers in the list, handling the empty list case as well. The test cases demonstrate the functionality of the code and verify that the code works correctly.  It is inspired by `type`: `function` headers to provide a simple documentation snippet for the functions, and asserts to verify expected behavior for specified inputs.
