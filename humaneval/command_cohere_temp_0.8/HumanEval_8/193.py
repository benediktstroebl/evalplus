```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """ For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
    (10, 24)
    """
    if not numbers:
        return (0, 1)
    return (sum(numbers), sum(numeries for _numeries in numbers for numeries)
```

The function checks if the input list is empty, it returns a tuple of (0, 1) accordingly. If the list is not empty, it proceeds to sum all the numbers in the list and multiply them as well. This is done using Python's built-in `sum` and `product` functions. 

This solution is fully type-hinted, making it potentially easier to understand and adapt for future developers. The separate initialization of the product variable with an empty list was avoided, as such an approach could potentially lead to bugs if the list is empty. Instead, the `if not numbers:` block covers this edge case.
