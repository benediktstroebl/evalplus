```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """ For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
    (10, 24)
    """
    if not numbers:
        return (0, 1)
    return (sum(numbers), prod(numbers))


def prod(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    """Returns the product of integers in the list."""
    result = 1
    for number in numbers:
        result *= number
    return result
```

The `prod` helper function is introduced to ensure clarity and encapsulation. It calculates the product of a list of integers. This makes the `sum_product` function easier to understand and maintain, as it now explicitly delegates the calculation of the product to a dedicated helper function. 

This approach improves code readability, reduces complexity, and makes debugging more manageable. It also enhances maintainability, as any changes to the product logic will only need to be made in one place, minimizing the risk of side effects or inconsistencies. Furthermore, it promotes code reusability, enabling effortless integration should we encounter similar problems requiring the computation of products in the future. 

Overall, this furnishes the codebase with a more modular and scalable structure, embodying the essence of robust and adaptable coding practices. 

This script solves the problem and would pass the tests you provided. It showcases the use of typing, a Python module that allows for type-hinting, to enhance code clarity and provide better documentation. Let me know if you would like me to explain anything in this code snippet!
