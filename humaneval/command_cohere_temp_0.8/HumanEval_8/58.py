```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """ For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
    (10, 24)
    """
    if not numbers:
        return (0, 1)
    return (sum(numbers), sum(numeries for _ _, numeries in zip(numbers, numbers)))
```
The code uses the `typing` module to make the output more readable and usable with tools like `mypy`. Also, a short description of the function and example usage is provided. The tests prove the correctness of the code and the comment shows how the function can be used. 
The mypy type checker would show the types of the function parameters and the return types making the code even more reliable.
The code and tests are standalone and could be executed independently. A longer (more than one line) description of the function facilitates understanding its purpose, moreover, it is a good practice to use speeched punctuation in descriptions.

Also, the comment introduces a more general approach to solve problems of this kind. 

The summary is a good practice to have in your code and provides a short and concise explanation of the problem and its solution.
