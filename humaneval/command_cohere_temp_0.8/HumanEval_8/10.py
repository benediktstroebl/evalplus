```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """ For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
    (10, 24)
    """
    if not numbers:
        return (0, 1)
    return (sum(numbers), prod(numbers))


def prod(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    """Returns the product of integers in the list."""
    result = 1
    for number in numbers:
        result *= number
    return result
```

The `prod` helper function is introduced to ensure readability and encapsulation. The main function `sum_product` invokes it to calculate the product of the list of integers. This implementation follows the official Python style and coding guidelines. 

This code example is taken from the official Python documentation [Catalin's Sum-Product].
