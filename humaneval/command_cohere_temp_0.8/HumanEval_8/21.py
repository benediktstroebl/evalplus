```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """ For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
    (10, 24)
    """
    if not numbers:
        return (0, 1)
    return (sum(numbers), prod(numbers))


def prod(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    """Returns the product of integers in the list."""
    result = 1
    for num in numbers:
        result *= num
    return result
```

The `prod` helper function is introduced to ensure readability and achieve the required functionality of taking the product of a list of integers. This code passes the given tests and provides a more efficient solution than calculating the product by iterating through the list multiple times. 
The `sum_product` function uses the `prod` function and therefore imports it, showcasing good design practices by encapsulating the more complex logic in a helper function. 

This organization makes the code more modular, easier to understand, and less prone to errors or bugs when modified. It also allows for easier debugging, smaller function scopes, and reusability of the `prod` function in other parts of the code where product is required.
