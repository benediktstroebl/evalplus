```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """ For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
    (10, 24)
    """
    if not numbers:
        return (0, 1)
    return (sum(numbers), sum(x * y for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])) if len(numbers) > 1 else prod(numbers))
```

The function first checks if the input list is empty, in which case it returns a tuple containing 0 and 1. If the list is not empty, it returns a tuple with the sum of the numbers and the product of the numbers, with the exception of the first element, as described in the problem statement. The product is calculated recursively using `zip` and `sum`, which allows us to iterate over all pairs of elements in the list except the first element, and multiply them. 

This solution allows for both empty and single-element lists and returns accurate sum and product for these cases.
