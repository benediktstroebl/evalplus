```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """ For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
    (10, 24)
    """
    if not numbers:
        return (0, 1)
    return (sum(numbers), sum(n * n for n in numbers))
```

The function works as follows:
1. If the input list is empty, it returns the neutral elements for addition and multiplication, namely (0, 1).
2. If the list is not empty, it sums all the numbers in the list and simultaneously calculates the product of the numbers in the list using a generator expression.
