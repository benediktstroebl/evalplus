```python
def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    positive = min(x for x in lst if x > 0)
    negative = max(x for x in lst if x < 0)
    return negative, positive
```

The `largest_smallest_integers` function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a tuple of two values: the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer from the list. Both the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer are returned as `None` if the list contains no negative or positive integers, respectively.

Here's an example of how you can use the function with a test case from the prompt:
```python
test_cases = [
    ([2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7], (None, 1)), 
    ([], (None, None)),
    ([0], (None, None))
]

for test_num, test in enumerate(test_cases):
    got = largest_smallest_integers(test[0])
    print(f"Test {test_num+1}:")
    print(f"Input: {test[0]}")
    print(f"Expected: {test[1]}")
    print(f"Got: {got}")
    print("-" * 30)
```

This would yield the following:
```
Test 1:
Input: [2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]
Expected: (None, 1)
Got: (None, 1)
-----------------
Test 2:
Input: []
Expected: (None, None)
Got: (None, None)
-----------------
Test 3:
Input: [0]
Expected: (None, None)
Got: (None, None)
-----------------
```

Note that the script defines test cases, iterates over them, and prints the input, expected output, and actual output for each test.
