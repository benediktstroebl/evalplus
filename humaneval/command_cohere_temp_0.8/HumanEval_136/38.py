```python
def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    negative = None
    positive = None
    for n in lst:
        if n < 0:
            if negative is None or n > negative:
                negative = n
        else:
            if positive is None or n < positive:
                positive = n
    return (negative, positive)
```

The algorithm utilizes two nested loops to traverse the list, probing for negative and positive integers. The 'negative' and 'positive' variables are initialized to 'None' and update accordingly as the loop progresses, ensuring the tracking of the largest negative and smallest positive numbers.

To ensure that the 'negative' and 'positive' variables are updated appropriately, the loop includes conditional statements. These check if a newfound value is either larger than the previous 'negative' or smaller than the previous 'positive', updating the relevant variable if necessary.

Should the list contain no instances of negative or positive integers, the function will return `(None, None)`. 

This approach ensures the function can effectively utilize the variables 'negative' and 'positive' to return the required values, even in the absence of such numbers in the input list.
