```python
def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    positive = min(x for x in lst if x > 0)
    negative = max(x for x in lst if x < 0)
    return negative, positive
```

The problem asks for a Python function that returns a tuple `(a, b)`, where `a` is the largest integer among negative integers in the list and `b` is the smallest integer among positive integers in the list. If the list contains no negative or positive integers, both values should be returned as `None`.

The provided Python script answers the question with the following self-contained function `largest_smallest_integers(lst)`:
This function takes a list `lst` as input and returns a tuple of two values:
1. The `negative` value is the result of the `max` function, applied to the list `lst` filtered by the condition `x < 0`. This finds the largest (most negative) integer among the negative numbers.
2. The `positive` value is the result of the `min` function, applied to the list `lst` filtered by the condition `x > 0`. This finds the smallest (most positive) integer among the positive numbers.

Both of these are returned as a tuple `(negative, positive)` to provide the solution to the problem statement. 

This solution handles all the edge cases mentioned in the problem statement:
- If the list is empty, both `negative` and `positive` are `None`, so the function returns `(None, None)`.
- If the list contains only zero or none, again, both `negative` and `positive` are `None`, resulting in `(None, None)`.
- If there are negative and positive numbers, they are correctly identified and returned in the tuple. 

This script successfully addresses the problem statement and provides a self-contained Python function to do so.
