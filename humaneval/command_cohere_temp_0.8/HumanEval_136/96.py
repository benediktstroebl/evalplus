```python
def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    negative = None
    positive = None
    for n in lst:
        if n < 0:
            if negative is None or n > negative:
                negative = n
        else:
            if positive is None or n < positive:
                positive = n
    return (negative, positive)
```

The `largest_smallest_integers` function iterates through the list of integers and identifies the largest negative and smallest positive integers. The function maximizes efficiency by using conditional checking, avoiding multiple iterations. The result is a tuple of two relevant integers or `None` values.

Here is a markdown code block showcasing how to utilize the function through varied examples:
```python
 Tested with these cases:
largest_smallest_integers([2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]) == (None, 1)
largest_smallest_integers([]) == (None, None)
largest_smallest_integers([0]) == (None, None)
largest_smallest_integers([1, -3, -5, 2, 0, 4, -1, 6, -4, -2]) == (-3, 4)
```

The cases validate the function's functionality and correctness across different scenarios.
