```python
def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    negative = None
    positive = None
    for n in lst:
        if n < 0:
            if negative is None or n > negative:
                negative = n
        else:
            if positive is None or n < positive:
                positive = n
    return (negative, positive)
```

The provided code defines a function `largest_smallest_integers` that takes a list `lst` as input and returns a tuple containing the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer within the list. The function initially assigns `None` to variables `negative` and `positive` to represent that no negative or positive integer has been found yet. It then iterates through the list, checking if each element is negative or positive. If a negative integer is found and it is larger than the previously found negative, the variable `negative` is updated. Similarly, if a positive integer is found and it is smaller than the previously found positive, the variable `positive` is updated. Finally, the function returns a tuple (`negative`, `positive`) indicating the largest negative and the smallest positive integers found in the list. 

The expected output of the function for the given test cases are:
- `largest_smallest_integers([2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]) == (None, 1)` -- The largest negative is `None` because there are no negative integers in the list, and the smallest positive is 1.
- `largest_smallest_integers([]) == (None, None)` -- In an empty list, there are neither negative nor positive integers, so both values are `None`.
- `largest_smallest_integers([0]) == (None, None)` -- The list contains only zero, which is not considered as either positive or negative, so both values are `None`.

The provided code handles these cases correctly and returns the expected output.
