```python
def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    negative = None
    positive = None
    for n in lst:
        if n < 0:
            if negative is None or n > negative:
                negative = n
        else:
            if positive is None or n < positive:
                positive = n
    return (negative, positive)
```

The algorithm utilizes two nested loops to traverse the list and monitor both positive and negative integers simultaneously. The variables `negative` and `positive` are initialized as `None`. The inner loop checks if a variable is `None` or if a new maximum (for negative) or minimum (for positive) has been found.

This approach ensures that the largest negative and smallest positive numbers are correctly identified and returned, even in cases where one or both values are missing from the input list.
