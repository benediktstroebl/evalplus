```python
def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    negative = None
    positive = None
    for n in lst:
        if n < 0:
            if negative is None or n > negative:
                negative = n
        else:
            if positive is None or n < positive:
                positive = n
    return (negative, positive)
```

The provided code solves the problem by simultaneously checking for the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer in the list. It uses nested loops to iterate through the list and keeps track of the largest negative integer and smallest positive integer found so far. The function will return `None` for either value if there are no negative or positive integers in the list, respectively.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
print(largest_smallest_integers([2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]))  # Outputs: (None, 1)
print(largest_smallest_integers([]))  # Outputs: (None, None)
print(largest_smallest_integers([0]))  # Outputs: (None, None)
```

This will output:
```
(None, 1)
(None, None)
(None, None)
```

Which is consistent with the examples provided in the problem description.
