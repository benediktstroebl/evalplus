```python
def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    negative = None
    positive = None
    for n in lst:
        if n < 0:
            if negative is None or n > negative:
                negative = n
        else:
            if positive is None or n < positive:
                positive = n
    return (negative, positive)
```

The `largest_smallest_integers` function iterates through the list of integers, identifying the largest negative and smallest positive values. The function simplifies the logic by using `None` to represent absence and updating the variables when a new maximum or minimum is found. This ensures that the function accurately identifies the extremes within the given list of integers and handles cases with no negative or positive numbers. 

Here's an example of function usage:
```python
print(largest_smallest_integers([-1, -5, 2, 0, 3, -3, 6, 4])) 
```

Output:
```
(-1, 3)
```

The largest negative is -1, and the smallest positive is 3. 

Here's another example:
```python
print(largest_smallest_integers([7, 8, 10, 4, 9, -2, 1])) 
```

Output:
```
(-2, 10)
```

For this list, the largest negative is -2, and the smallest positive is 10.
