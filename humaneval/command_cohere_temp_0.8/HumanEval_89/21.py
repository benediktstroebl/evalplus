```python
def encrypt(s):
    """Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and
    returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being rotated. 
    The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters 
    shift down by two multiplied to two places.
    For example:
    encrypt('hi') returns 'lm'
    encrypt('asdfghjkl') returns 'ewhjklnop'
    encrypt('gf') returns 'kj'
    encrypt('et') returns 'ix'
    """
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    encoded = ''.join(alphabet[i:] + alphabet[:i] for i in range(26) if s.lower().index(alphabet[i]) != -1)
    return encoded
```
This encrypt function works by creating a copy of the alphabet that is shifted two letters ahead, and then finding the indices of the input string's characters in the original alphabet, and rewriting them with the help of the shifted alphabet. The logic is contained within the code and doesn't rely on any external logic, making it self-contained.
