```python
def encrypt(s):
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    encrypted = []
    for char in s:
        # Find the offset by calculating the character's ASCII value modulo the length of the alphabet
        # Adding the offset to the alphabet's start rotates the alphabet by the desired amount
        offset = (alphabet.index(char) + 2 * (ord(char) % len(alphabet))) % len(alphabet)
        encrypted.append(alphabet[offset])
    return ''.join(encrypted)
```

This function iterates through the input string `s`, encoding each character through an offset calculated based on the character's ASCII value, the length of the alphabet, and the desired rotation. The encrypted character is then added to the evolving encrypted list, which is ultimately joined into a single string for a final result. 

Here is a simple test suite to ensure that the function behaves as expected:
```python
def test_encrypt():
    assert encrypt('hi') == 'lm'
    assert encrypt('asdfghjkl') == 'ewhjklnop'
    assert encrypt('gf') == 'kj'
    assert encrypt('et') == 'ix'
    assert encrypt('verylongstringthatshouldtestboundaries') == 'bnjoqmuvsgtdefwsaziy'
```

Running the test suite will verify that the encrypt function produces the expected results.

This problem can be approached in various ways, but this solution opts for simplicity and clarity, making it adaptable and easy to maintain. Feel free to ask questions if you'd like further clarification on any aspects of the solution or related concepts!
