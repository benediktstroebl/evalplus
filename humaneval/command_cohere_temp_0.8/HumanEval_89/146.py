```python
def encrypt(s):
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    encrypted = []
    for char in s:
        # multiply char by 2, taking modulo 26
        char_double = (ord(char) * 2) % 26
        # add two to char double and take modulo 26
        char_double_shifted = (char_double + 2) % 26
        encrypted.append(alphabet[char_double_shifted])
    return ''.join(encrypted)
```

This function uses a basic Caesar cipher encryption approach. It multiplies each character by 2 and then adds 2 to shift the alphabet two places down. The modulo 26 ensures that the equivalent of wrapping around the alphabet is applied, since going outside the range of 'a' to 'z' would push the alphabet back to the beginning. Finally, the encrypted characters are joined together to form the final encrypted string. 

To verify the functionality of the provided encrypt function, you can use the following tests:
```python
def test_encrypt():
    assert encrypt('hi') == 'lm'
    assert encrypt('asdfghjkl') == 'ewhjklnop'
    assert encrypt('gf') == 'kj'
    assert encrypt('et') == 'ix'
    assert encrypt('verylongstringthatshouldbetestingtheboundaries') == 'jqngjzmvr'
```

These tests cover various scenarios, including edge cases, to confirm that the encrypt function performs the expected encryption.
