```python
def encrypt(s):
    encrypted = ''
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    rotate_letters = 2 * 2
    for letter in s:
        # Find the letter's index in the English alphabet
        index = alphabet.find(letter)
        # Add the letter from the rotated position
        encrypted += alphabet[index + rotate_letters]
    return encrypted
```

This encrypt function takes a string s and returns a string encrypted using the rotated alphabet. 

The alphabet is rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places. The function uses a for loop to iterate through each letter in the input string s and encrypts each letter by adding the letter's index multiplied by 2 to the alphabet. The encrypted string is then returned. You can test the function by calling it and comparing the output with the examples provided.
