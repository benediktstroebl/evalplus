```python
def encrypt(s):
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    encrypted = []
    for char in s:
        index = alphabet.find(char)
       encrypt_index = (index + 2 * 2) % 26
        encrypted.append(alphabet[encrypt_index])
    return ''.join(encrypted)
```
This function uses a loop to iterate through each character in the input string `s`. For each character, it finds its position in the alphabet, then calculates the encrypted position using a formula that shifts the alphabet by two multiplied to two places. The modulus operator (`%`) is used to ensure the index stays within the bounds of the alphabet size. Finally, the encrypted character is appended to the `encrypted` list, and the function returns the joined string. 

Here is a test drive code to test the above function:
```python
def test_encrypt():
    assert encrypt('hi') == 'lm'
    assert encrypt('asdfghjkl') == 'ewhjklnop'
    assert encrypt('gf') == 'kj'
    assert encrypt('et') == 'ix'
    assert encrypt('verylongstringthatshouldtestboundaries') == 'fcnjbmpde'
test_encrypt()
```
This test drive code will execute the `encrypt()` function with multiple inputs and compares the output with the expected result using the `assert` statement. 

The code inside the `test_encrypt()` function is an example of unit testing, which is a practice of testing individual units of code (in this case, the `encrypt()` function) to ensure they function as expected. 

Note: Inside the `test_encrypt()` function, the `encrypt()` function is called with a long string that includes boundaries to test if the function handles strings of different lengths correctly.
