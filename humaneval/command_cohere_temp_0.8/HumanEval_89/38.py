```python
def encrypt(s):
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    encrypted = []
    for char in s:
        index = alphabet.find(char)
        encrypted.append(alphabet[(index + 2 * 2) % 26])
    return ''.join(encrypted)
```
This Python script defines a function `encrypt` that takes a string `s` as input and returns an encrypted version of the string. Here's how it works:
1. The variable `alphabet` stores the full alphabet from 'a' to 'z'.
2. The variable `encrypted` is initialized as an empty list. This will store the encrypted characters on a step-by-step basis as we encrypt the input string.
3. The input string is iterated using a `for` loop.
4. For each character `char` in the input string:
   - The `find` method of the `alphabet` string is used to find the index of the character in the alphabet. This gives us the numerical position of the character in the alphabet, which we will manipulate to perform the encryption.
5. The formula `((index + 2 * 2) % 26)` is applied to rotate the alphabet by shifting each character down by two multiplied to two positions. This formula achieves the desired encryption effect.
6. The encrypted character is appended to the `encrypted` list.
7. After processing all characters in the input string, the function joins the encrypted characters together into a single string and returns the encrypted result.

The script ensures that the encryption process is consistent with the given problem statement, and the output of the `encrypt` function matches the provided examples in the problem description.
