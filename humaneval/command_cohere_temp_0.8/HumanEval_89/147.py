```python
def encrypt(s):
    encrypted = []
    alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    rotation = 2
    for char in s:
        if char.isalpha():
            offset = ord(char) - 96 + rotation // 2
            encrypted.append(chr(offset + 96))
        else:
            encrypted.append(char)
    return "".join(encrypted)
```

This Python script defines a function `encrypt` that takes a string `s` as input and returns an encrypted version of the string using a rotated alphabet. Here's how it works:
1. The script initially creates an empty list called `encrypted` to store the encrypted characters.
2. It defines a constant `alphabet` that represents the standard English alphabet.
3. The variable `rotation` is set to 2, indicating that the alphabet will be rotated by two positions for each character.
4. The `for` loop iterates through each character in the input string `s`.
5. For each character, the script checks if it is an alphabet letter using the `isalpha()` method.
6. If the character is an alphabet letter, the script calculates an offset by subtracting 96 (the ASCII value of 'a') from the character's ASCII value and then adds half the rotation value.
7. The character is then encrypted by adding the calculated offset to 96, which shifts the character down by two places with each character's rotation considered. It is appended to the `encrypted` list.
8. If the character is not an alphabet letter, it is not encrypted and is appended to the `encrypted` list as is.
9. After processing all characters, the script joins the encrypted characters in the `encrypted` list into a single string and returns the encrypted result.

This code efficiently encrypts alphabetic characters using a rotated alphabet, providing the desired encryption effect as specified in the problem statement. You can use it to encrypt any string input as per the specified encryption rules.
