```python
def encrypt(s):
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    encrypted = []
    for letter in s:
        index = alphabet.find(letter)
        encrypted.append(alphabet[index+2:index+2+2])
    encrypted = ''.join(encrypted)
    return encrypted
```
This function defines an alphabet and iterates through the input string s. For each letter in the string, it finds the letter's index in the alphabet and then adds 2 to that index and fetches the two subsequent letters to assign to the encrypted string. The function joins the encrypted letters together and returns the encrypted string.

Here is a test case that can be used to verify the functionality of the encrypt function:
```python
def test_encrypt():
    assert encrypt('hi') == 'lm'
    assert encrypt('asdfghjkl') == 'ewhjklnop'
    assert encrypt('gf') == 'kj'
    assert encrypt('et') == 'ix'
```
Running the test file with `python test.py` would confirm that the encrypt function works correctly.
