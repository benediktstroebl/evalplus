```python
def encrypt(s):
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    encrypted = ''
    for char in s:
        index = alphabet.find(char)
       encrypted += alphabet[index + 2]*2
```
The `encrypt` function takes a string `s` as input and iterates through each character in the string. It uses the `find` method to convert each character in the string to its corresponding index in the alphabet and then adds 2 to the index and multiplies it by 2 to shift the alphabet down by two places, resulting in the encrypted character. This encrypted character is then added to the `encrypted` string, which returns the encrypted message.

Here is a more improved version of the above code that is more efficient and has a more structured approach:
```python
def encrypt(s):
    """Encrypted a string with a shifted alphabet."""
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    encrypted = ''

    for char in s:
        index = alphabet.find(char)
        if index == -1:
            # If the character is not in the alphabet, return it as is.
            encrypted += char
        else:
            # Encrypt the character according to the algorithm.
            encrypted += alphabet[index + 2]*2
    return encrypted
```
This version of the code introduces a new branch to handle situations where characters are not part of the alphabet. This scenario is uncommon and often erroneous, as the problem statement indicates that the input contains only characters from the alphabet. Nonetheless, it is prudent to manage such scenarios gracefully, and this version of the code achieves that.

Both versions of the code encrypt the characters in the same manner, but the second version is more resilient and provides a more consistent treatment of characters that are not part of the alphabet.
