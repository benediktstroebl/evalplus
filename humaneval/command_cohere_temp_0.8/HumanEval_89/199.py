```python
def encrypt(s):
    encrypted = []
    alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    rotated_alphabet = alphabet[2:] + alphabet[:2]
    for char in s:
        if char in alphabet:
            encrypted.append(rotated_alphabet[alphabet.index(char)])
        else:
            encrypted.append(char)
    return ''.join(encrypted)
```

This function takes a string `s` as input and iterates through each character in the string. It uses the `alphabet` variable to store the complete alphabet, and the `rotated_alphabet` variable to store the shifted alphabet, which is created by concatenating the last two letters of the normal alphabet to the beginning of the alphabet, and vice versa. This ensures that the letters 'a', 'b', which are mapped to 'c', 'd' in the rotated alphabet, respectively, will be correctly mapped to 'e', 'f' on the next iteration.

Then, for each character in the string, it checks if the character is present in the alphabet. If it is, the character is replaced with the corresponding letter in the rotated alphabet, otherwise, it's left unchanged. Finally, the function returns the encrypted string. 

Here is a test suite to ensure the function correctly encrypts inputs:
```python
def test_encrypt():
    assert encrypt('hi') == 'lm'
    assert encrypt('asdfghjkl') == 'ewhjklnop'
    assert encrypt('gf') == 'kj'
    assert encrypt('et') == 'ix'
    assert encrypt('foo') == 'pbjs'
    assert encrypt('bar') == 'qzrs'
    assert encrypt('manually') == 'gzbvum'
    assert encrypt('numberstoo') == 'rlnbejyd'
    assert assert encrypt('foo123bar') == 'pbjzrsm'
```

With this, the code will execute the test suite and output `OK` if the tests pass.
