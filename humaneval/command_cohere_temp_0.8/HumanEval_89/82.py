```python
def encrypt(s):
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    encrypted = []
    for letter in s:
        # Find the index of the current letter in the alphabet
        index = alphabet.find(letter)

        # Move the letter two places down in the alphabet and add it to the list
        encrypted.append(alphabet[index + 2])
    return ''.join(encrypted)
```

This function takes a string `s` as input and iterates through each letter in the string. It first finds the index of the current letter in the alphabet, and then adds the letter two places down in the alphabet to the `encrypted` list. The function then joins the list of encrypted letters into a single string and returns the result.

To verify the functionality of the code, you can run this test case:
```python
import unittest

def __starting_point():
    assert encrypt('hi') == 'lm'
    assert encrypt('asdfghjkl') == 'ewhjklnop'
    assert encrypt('gf') == 'kj'
    assert encrypt('et') == 'ix'

class TestEncryptFunction(unittest.TestCase):
    __starting_point()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This will run the `encrypt` function with different input strings and verify that the output is correct for each case.
