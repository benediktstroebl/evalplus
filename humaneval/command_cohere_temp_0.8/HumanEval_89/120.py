```python
def encrypt(s):
    encrypted = ''
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    rotate_by = 2 * 2

    for char in s:
        offset = ord(char) - 96
        encrypted_char = chr(offset + rotate_by)
        encrypted += encrypted_char

    return encrypted
```

This function uses a temporary `alphabet` variable to define the standard offset for each character, setting `rotate_by` as a multiple of `2` triggered `2` times. The function iterates through the input string, determining the offset for each character, and then adds the `rotate_by` value to it. It utilizes `chr` to convert the resulting number back to a character, adding it to the building `encrypted` string. The output is an `encrypted` string applying the specified rotation algorithm. 

This solution is adaptable, efficient, and follows coding conventions, providing a robust implementation for the encryption problem. Feel free to ask if you'd like further clarification or additional code insights.
