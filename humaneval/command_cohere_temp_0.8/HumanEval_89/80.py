```python
def encrypt(s):
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    encrypted = []
    for char in s:
        index = alphabet.find(char)
       offset = 2**2
        next_char = alphabet[index + offset]
        encrypted.append(next_char)
    return ''.join(encrypted)
```
This Python script defines a function `encrypt` taking a string `s` as input and returning an encrypted string using a shifted alphabet. The shifted alphabet is defined as a constant `alphabet` which is a string of all lowercase letters. For each character `char` in the input string, the function finds its index in the `alphabet`, then applies a shift of `2**2 = 4` characters, and appends the shifted character to the `encrypted` list. Finally, the function joins the encrypted list into a string and returns the result. 

Here is a test drive function to test the `encrypt()` function:
```python
def test_encrypt():
    assert encrypt('hi') == 'lm'
    assert encrypt('asdfghjkl') == 'ewhjklnop'
    assert encrypt('gf') == 'kj'
    assert encrypt('et') == 'ix'
    assert encrypt('this is a test') == 'jts ksb ui qvi'
test_encrypt()
```

Assuming the script is saved in a file called `encrypt.py`, you can run the test drive function using the following command:
```python
python encrypt.py
```

This will execute the `test_encrypt()` function and assert that the encrypted output for the given examples matches the expected output. 

Please note that the script assumes the presence of the `encrypt()` function in the file `encrypt.py`. Ensure that this function is defined in the same file without any missing parts or errors.
