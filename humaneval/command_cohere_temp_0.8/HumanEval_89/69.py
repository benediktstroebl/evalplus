```python
def encrypt(s):
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    encrypted = []
    for letter in s:
        index = alphabet.find(letter)
        encrypted.append(alphabet[(index + 2 * 2) % 26])
    return ''.join(encrypted)
```
This function uses a basic Caesar cipher encryption where the alphabet letters are shifted by a fixed amount to encrypt a message. In this case, the alphabet is shifted down by two multiplied by two positions, or two letters, making it a more challenging problem than traditional Caesar cipher encryption. The remainder operation (module) is used to ensure the alphabet loop is handled correctly and will shift correctly upon successive encryptions. The algorithm tests the letter, determines its index within the alphabet, shifts by the specified amount, and then modulates the shift to ensure it wraps around the alphabet, leaving no gaps. 

Let's explore a sample output for the given example scenarios:
1. encrypt('hi') -lm
2. encrypt('asdfghjkl') - ewhjklnop
3. encrypt('gf') - kj
4. encrypt('et') - ix
This code retains the rotational pattern of the encryption while remaining self-contained within the function as required. 
It's crucial to note that this kind of encryption is not very secure and is considered a basic form of data encryption. More critical or sensitive applications should utilize more advanced and robust encryption techniques.
