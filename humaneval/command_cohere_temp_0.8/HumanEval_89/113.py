```python
def encrypt(s):
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    encrypted = ''

    for char in s:
        index = alphabet.find(char)
        if index == -1:
            encrypted += char
        else:
            # Rotate the alphabet by 2 multiplied to 2 places
            # E.g., 'a' becomes 'c' which becomes 'e' etc.
            encrypted += alphabet[(index + 2 * 2) % 26]
    return encrypted
```

This Python script defines a function `encrypt` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a string with each character encrypted using the shifted alphabet as described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:
1. **Variable Initialization**: The variable `alphabet` is assigned the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` which represents the standard English alphabet. The variable `encrypted` is initialized to an empty string, which will store the encrypted characters.
2. **Loop through Input String**: The code uses a `for` loop to iterate through each character in the input string `s`.
3. **Handling Non-alphabetical Characters**: Inside the loop, it first checks if the character `char` is present in the `alphabet` using the `find` method. If the character is not in the alphabet (e.g., non-alphabetical character), it adds the original character to the `encrypted` string. This ensures that any non-alphabetical characters or punctuation marks in the input are not affected by the encryption and remain the same in the output.
4. **Encryption Process**: If the character `char` is in the alphabet, the code calculates the new position of that character in the rotated alphabet. It does this by adding 2 (`2 * 2`) to the current index and then taking the modulus 26 to ensure the index wraps around within the bounds of the alphabet. The character at this new position in the rotated alphabet is added to the `encrypted` string.
5. **Final Encrypted String**: After processing all characters in the input string, the `encrypted` string contains the encrypted form of the input string, with each character shifted in the manner described in the problem statement.

The code provides an elegant and efficient solution to the problem, ensuring that the encryption process aligns with the problem statement's requirement of shifting the alphabet by two multiplied to two places.
