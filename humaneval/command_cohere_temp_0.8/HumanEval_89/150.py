```python
def encrypt(s):
    encrypted = []
    alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    rotated_alphabet = alphabet[2::2] + alphabet[1::2] + alphabet[0::2]
    for char in s:
      encrypted.append(rotated_alphabet[alphabet.index(char)])
    return ''.join(encrypted)
```

This code defines a function `encrypt` that takes a string `s` as input and outputs a string encrypted using the rotated alphabet. It achieves this by:
1. Creating an empty list called `encrypted` to store the encrypted characters.
2. Setting the `alphabet` as the standard alphabet which is then rotated to create the `rotated_alphabet`.
3. Using the `index` method to find the original alphabet position of each character in `s`, it then retrieves the encrypted character from the `rotated_alphabet` using the calculated index and adds it to `encrypted`.
4. Finally, `'.join(encrypted)'` is used to convert the `encrypted` list to a string and return the result. 

This solution is relatively efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`, as it iterates through the string `s` once, performing a constant-time operation for each character.
