```python
def encrypt(s):
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    encrypted = []
    for char in s:
        index = alphabet.find(char)
       encrypted.append(alphabet[index:index+2])
    return ''.join(encrypted)
```
This Python script defines a function `encrypt` taking a string as an argument and returning an encrypted version of the string using a rotated alphabet. The alphabet is rotated in a manner that shifts each letter down by two characters and is multiplied to two places. The function iterates through each character in the input string, finds its index within the original alphabet, and then appends the two characters immediately after the designated index to the `encrypted` list. Finally, it joins all encrypted characters into a single string and returns the result. 

Here is an example usage of the function and the expected output:
```python
print(encrypt('hi'))      # Expected output: lm
print(encrypt('asdfghjkl')) # Expected output: ewhjklnop
print(encrypt('gf'))        # Expected output: kj
print(encrypt('et'))        # Expected output: ix
```
This demonstrates how the `encrypt` function can be utilized to encrypt various input strings using the specified rotated alphabet algorithm.
