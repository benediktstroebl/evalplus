```python
def encrypt(s):
    encrypted = []
    alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    shift = 2
    for char in s:
        # multiply the shift to the corresponding index and obtain the character from the shifted alphabet
        encrypted.append(alphabet[alphabet.index(char) * shift])
    return ''.join(encrypted)
```

This function uses a for loop to iterate through each character in the input string `s`. For each character, it computes the offset by which the alphabet is shifted, obtains the character from the shifted alphabet, and appends it to the `encrypted` list. The process involves locating the character's index in the alphabet, shifting it downwards by multiplying the index with the predefined `shift`, and obtaining the character from the resulting shifted alphabet. Finally, the function returns the `encrypted` string joined together.

Here's a usage example to demonstrate the function's behavior:
```python
print(encrypt('hi')) # lm
print(encrypt('asdfghjkl')) # ewhjklnop
print(encrypt('gf')) # kj
print(encrypt('et')) # ix
```

This example showcases the function's ability to encrypt different input strings using the rotated alphabet mechanism, producing the expected encrypted outputs.
