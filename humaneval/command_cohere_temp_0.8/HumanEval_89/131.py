```python
def encrypt(s):
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    encrypted = []
    for char in s:
        index = alphabet.find(char)
       new_index = (index + 2 * 2) % len(alphabet)
        encrypted.append(alphabet[new_index])
    return ''.join(encrypted)
```
This Python script defines a function called `encrypt` that takes a string `s` as input and returns an encrypted version of the string. Below are detailed steps on how the function works:
1. Firstly, the function creates an `alphabet` string, which is prepended to the list of characters used for encryption, namely 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. This string is essential for character lookups and is a modulus against which character indices are calculated.
2. Then, an empty list named `encrypted` is initialized. This list will eventually contain the encrypted characters.
3. The function then iterates through each character in the provided string `s`.
4. For each character, the function first finds the index of the character in the `alphabet` string using the `find` method. The `find` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the character in the string, or -1 if the character is not found.
5. Then, a new index is calculated by adding the current index and multiplying by 2 twice, and then taking the modulus of the length of the `alphabet` string. This process corresponds to shifting each character down two places in the alphabet, and then wrapping around to the beginning of the alphabet if necessary.
6. The character at the new index in the `alphabet` string is appended to the `encrypted` list.
7. After all characters in the string have been processed, the function joins the encrypted characters together into a single string and returns it.

Here are some test cases that demonstrate the behavior of the encrypt function:
```python
assert encrypt('hi') == 'lm'
assert encrypt('asdfghjkl') == 'ewhjklnop'
assert encrypt('gf') == 'kj'
assert encrypt('et') == 'ix'
assert encrypt('Hello World') == 'Cnjsnu Otuk'
```
