```python
def encrypt(s):
    encrypted = ''
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    rotate_letters = 2 * 2
    for letter in s:
        encrypted_letter = alphabet[alphabet.find(letter) + rotate_letters]
        encrypted += encrypted_letter
    return encrypted
```

This Python script defines a function `encrypt` that takes a string `s` as input and returns an encrypted version of the string using the rotated alphabet behavior described in the prompt. 

The alphabet `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz` is predefined for easy reference. The variable `rotate_letters` is set to `2 * 2` to ensure the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places. The `encrypt` function iterates through each letter in the input string `s`. For each letter, it finds the rotated letter in the alphabet using the formula `alphabet.find(letter) + rotate_letters` and adds it to the `encrypted` string. 

Here is an example usage of the function for the input `'hi'`:
```python
encrypt('hi')
# lm
```

And here is an example usage of the function for the input `'asdfghjkl'`:
```python
encrypt('asdfghjkl')
# ewhjklnop
```

This demonstrates how the function correctly encrypts the input string using the rotated alphabet scheme, producing the expected encrypted output. 

Overall, the provided Python script solves the problem with correctness and efficiency, providing a practical implementation of the encrypted text algorithm.  If you have any questions, please let me know! I'm happy to clarify how the code works or provide additional insights if desired.
