```python
def encrypt(s):
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    encrypted = []
    for char in s:
        index = alphabet.find(char)
        encrypted.append(alphabet[index + 2 * (index % 2) :: 2])
    return ''.join(encrypted)
```
This Python script defines a function `encrypt` that takes a string `s` as input and outputs a string encrypted using a rotated alphabet. The script creates an `alphabet` string containing all lowercase letters. It initializes an empty list `encrypted` to store the encrypted characters. The code then iterates through each character in the input string `s`. For each character, it finds its index within the `alphabet`, then adds the character at a rotated index to the `encrypted` list. The rotation amount is determined by the formula `2 * (index % 2)`, which shifts the alphabet down by two characters each iteration. Finally, the function joins the encrypted characters into a single string and returns the result.
