```python
def encrypt(s):
    encrypted = []
    alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    shifts = [2, 2]

    for char in s:
        index = alphabet.find(char)
        shifted_index = (index + shifts[0] * shifts[1]) % len(alphabet)
        encrypted.append(alphabet[shifted_index])

    return ''.join(encrypted)
```

This Python script defines a function `encrypt` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the encrypted version of the string. Below is a breakdown of the code:
1. It initializes an empty list called `encrypted` to store the encrypted characters.
2. The `alphabet` variable holds the full alphabet from 'a' to 'z'.
3. The `shifts` list defines the number of shifts and the direction (right or left) for each character.
4. Then, for each character in the input string `s`:
   - It finds the index of the character in the alphabet.
   - It calculates the shifted index by adding the product of the shifts to the current index, and then taking the modulus of the length of the alphabet to handle the wraparounds.
   - It appends the character at the shifted index to the `encrypted` list.
5. Finally, it joins the encrypted characters together into a string and returns the result.

The logic of the provided code aligns with the problem's requirement of encrypting a string by shifting characters down the alphabet with a specified shift distance.
