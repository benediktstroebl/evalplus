```python
def encrypt(s):
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    encrypted = ''
    for char in s:
        index = alphabet.find(char)
        encrypted += alphabet[index + 2 * 2::2]
    return encrypted
```

This Python script defines a function `encrypt` taking a string `s` as input and returning an encrypted string using a rotated alphabet. The algorithm:
1. Starts with an empty string `encrypted`.
2. Iterates through each character (`char`) in the input string `s`.
3. Finds the index of the character in the English alphabet (`alphabet`) using `find`.
4. Adds 2 to the index, then divides by 2, effectively shifting the characters down two places.
5. Appends the character at the adjusted index to `encrypted`.
6. The final `encrypted` string is returned.
