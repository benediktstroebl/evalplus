```python
def encrypt(string):
    encrypted = ''
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    rotated_alphabet = alphabet[2:] + alphabet[:2]
    for char in string:
        if char in alphabet:
            index = alphabet.index(char)
            encrypted += rotated_alphabet[index]
        else:
            encrypted += char
    return encrypted
```

This Python code defines a function **`encrypt`** that takes a string as input and encrypts it using a rotated alphabet scheme. It starts with the standard English alphabet `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` and creates a new alphabet by shifting each letter down by two positions. This rotated alphabet is then used to encrypt the input string character by character. The function constructs the encrypted string by looking up each character's index in the original alphabet and replacing it with the corresponding letter from the rotated alphabet. Any characters that are not in the English alphabet are left unchanged in the encrypted string.
