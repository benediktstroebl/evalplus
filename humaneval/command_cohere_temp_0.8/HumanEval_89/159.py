```python
def encrypt(s):
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    encrypted = []
    for char in s:
        index = alphabet.find(char)
       new_index = (index + 2 * 2) % len(alphabet)
        encrypted.append(alphabet[new_index])
    return ''.join(encrypted)
```
This function uses a loop to iterate through each character in the input string `s`. It finds the character's position in the alphabet, shifts it down by 2 places to the next even-numbered letter, and then adds the corresponding character to the `encrypted` list. The final encrypted string is returned after joining the encrypted list. 

To ensure the correctness of the script, the module `alphabet` is defined explicitly to avoid any potential errors resulting from the assumption that the alphabet consists of `26` letters. 

This function operates independently and does not rely on any external variables, making it self-contained. It is compatible with Python 3 since it uses features specific to that version, such as the `find` method for strings. Although this is not explicitly mentioned in the function, it is assumed that the input string contains only alphabetic characters. Any other characters or invalid inputs are not handled and may cause errors or unexpected outputs.
