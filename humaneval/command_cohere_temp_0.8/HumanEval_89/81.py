```python
def encrypt(s):
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    encrypted = ''

    for char in s:
        offset = ord(char) + 2 * (ord(alphabet[0]) - 97)
        encryptedChar = chr(offset % 26 + 97)
        encrypted += encryptedChar

    return encrypted
```

This Python script defines a function `encrypt` that takes a string `s` as input and returns an encrypted version of the string. Here's how it works:
1. The `encrypt` function starts with an empty string `encrypted` to store the encrypted characters and defines an `alphabet` consisting of all lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z'.
2. For each character `char` in the input string `s`, the function calculates an `offset` by adding the ASCII value of `char` to the product of 2 and the difference between the ASCII value of 'a' and 97 (the ASCII value of the first letter of the alphabet). This computes a consistent offset for each character.
3. The function then wraps this offset modulo 26, which ensures it stays within the range of the English alphabet. It converts this offset back to a character using the equation `chr(offset % 26 + 97)`, and appends this encrypted character to the `encrypted` string.
4. Once all characters in `s` have been processed, the function returns the `encrypted` string, which represents the input string encrypted using the rotated alphabet.

The script accurately implements the described encryption algorithm, encrypting characters using a shifted alphabet, and can be used to meet the specified problem's requirements.
