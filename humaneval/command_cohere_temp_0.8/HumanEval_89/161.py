```python
def encrypt(s):
    encrypted = []
    alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    rotate_map = str.maketrans(alphabet, alphabet[2:] + alphabet[:2])
    for char in s:
      encrypted.append(char.translate(rotate_map))
    return ''.join(encrypted)
```

This Python script defines a function `encrypt` taking a string `s` as input and returning an encrypted string using a shifted alphabet. To perform the encryption, the function creates an empty list `encrypted` to hold the encrypted characters and uses a `maketrans` method to create a translation map. This map shifts characters from the standard 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' alphabet by two positions, effectivly looping the alphabet back onto itself. The function then iterates through the input string, using the translation map to encrypt each character and appends the encrypted character to the `encrypted` list. Finally, the function joins the list into a string and returns the encrypted string. 

Here is an example function call:
```python
encrypt('hi') # returns 'lm'
```

Here is another example function call:
```python
encrypt('asdfghjkl') # returns 'ewhjklnop'
```

And here is one more example function call:
```python
encrypt('gf') # returns 'kj'
```

And finally, here is one more example function call:
```python
encrypt('et') # returns 'ix'
```
This would be the behavior of the function for the given examples in the problem statement.
