```python
def encrypt(s):
    encrypted = ''
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    rotated_alphabet = alphabet[2:] + alphabet[:2]
    for char in s:
      encrypted += rotated_alphabet[alphabet.find(char) + 2]
    return encrypted
```

This Python code defines a function `encrypt` that takes a string `s` as input and outputs a string `encrypted`. It utilizes a rotated alphabet to encrypt the input string, shifting letters down by 2 positions, and demonstrates this with an example. The script can be used to encrypt any string using its inventive encryption approach. 

You can test this function's correctness by calling it on various examples and comparing it with the output that is expected. Here is an example:
```python
>>> encrypt('hi')
'lm'

>>> encrypt('asdfghjkl')
'ewhjklnop'

>>> encrypt('gf')
'kj'

>>> encrypt('et')
'ix'
```
