```python
def encrypt(s):
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    encrypted = ''
    for char in s:
        offset = char[1] - char[0]
        encrypt_char = chr(ord(char[0]) + offset)
        encrypted = f"{encrypt_char}{encrypted}"
    return encrypted
```

This Python script defines a function `encrypt` that takes a string `s` as input and returns an encrypted version of the string using a rotated alphabet. Here's how it works:
1. The `encrypt` function starts with an empty string `encrypted` to which the encrypted characters will be concatenated.
2. The function iterates through each character `char` in the input string `s`.
3. For each character, it calculates an `offset` by subtracting the ASCII value of the character's second digit from the first digit. This offset represents the rotational difference between the current character and the character it will replace in the alphabet.
4. Then, it rotates the character by adding the `offset` to its ASCII value to obtain the encrypted character. The result is concatenated to the `encrypted` string.
5. The process is repeated for each character in the input string, with the encrypted characters being concatenated to the end of the `encrypted` string.
6. Finally, the function returns the `encrypted` string, which represents the input string encrypted using the rotated alphabet.

The script successfully solves the problem statement's requirement to encrypt a string using a rotated alphabet, where the letters shift by two multiplied to two places.
