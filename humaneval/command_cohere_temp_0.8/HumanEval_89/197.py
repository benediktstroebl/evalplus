```python
def encrypt(s):
    encrypted = []
    for char in s:
        if char.isalpha():
            if char.isupper():
                offset = ord('Z') - ord('A')
                encrypted.append(chr((ord(char) - offset + 2) % 26 + ord('A')))
            else:
                offset = ord('z') - ord('a')
                encrypted.append(chr((ord(char) - offset + 2) % 26 + ord('a')))
        else:
            encrypted.append(char)
    return ''.join(encrypted)
```

This script defines a function `encrypt` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a encrypted version of the string using the specified encryption algorithm. Below is a breakdown of the code:
1. It iterates through each character in the input string `s`.
2. It checks if each character is an alphabet letter using the `isalpha()` and `isupper()` methods.
3. If the character is an uppercase letter, it calculates the offset as the difference between 'Z' and 'A', which is 26. It wants to shift each letter down by 2 positions, so it calculates the new position as `(ord(char) - offset + 2) % 26`, which shifts it down by 2. It then wraps around using modulo 26 to ensure the result is a letter and adds the 'A' offset to get the final encrypted letter.
4. If the character is a lowercase letter, it calculates the offset as the difference between 'z' and 'a', which is 26. It then follows a similar process to shift the letter down by 2 positions and wraps around using modulo 26 to ensure the result is a letter, this time adding the 'a' offset.
5. For characters that are not letters, the loop simply appends them to the encrypted list as is.
6. Finally, the function returns the encrypted string by joining the elements in the encrypted list.

The method articulates a concise and readable approach to encryption, making it easier to discern the logic behind the encryption and allowing for easier debugging and understanding.
