```python
def encrypt(s):
    encrypted = []
    alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    rotate = 2
    for char in s:
      if char.isalpha():
        char = alphabet[alphabet.index(char) - rotate:alphabet.index(char) + rotate + 26]
        encrypted.append(char)
    return ''.join(encrypted)
```
This function uses a loop to iterate through each character in the input string `s`. For each character, it checks if the character is alphabetical using the `isalpha()` method. If true, it retrieves the rotated alphabet using the character's index and the defined rotation shift. This is then converted to a string and appended to `encrypted` list. The function returns the encrypted string by joining the `encrypted` list. 

To ensure the function is correct, you can test it with the following input-output cases:
```python
test = ['hi', 'asdfghjkl', 'gf', 'et', 'xyz']
expected = ['lm', 'ewhjklnop', 'kj', 'ix', 'zb']
for inp, exp in zip(test, expected):
    assert encrypt(inp) == exp
```
This test code provides an efficient way to validate the `encrypt` function. It utilizes zipping to iterate through each input test case and expected output case simultaneously, checking them with the `assert` statement.  This ensures that the function works correctly and produces the desired encrypted output.  The test cases can be adapted to cover a broader spectrum of scenarios, showcasing the flexibility of the encryption algorithm. 
To run the test, you can use the `python -m unittest test.test_encrypt` command, which will execute the `test_encrypt` test module and aggregate the test results.  making it streamlined to validate and confirm the correctness of the `encrypt` function.  By writing robust tests, you can have a reliable way to ensure that the code behaves as expected and conforms to the problem statement.
