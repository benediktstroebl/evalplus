```python
def encrypt(s):
    encrypted = []
    alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    rotated_alphabet = alphabet[2::2] + alphabet[1::2]
    for char in s:
      if char in alphabet:
        encrypted.append(rotated_alphabet[alphabet.index(char)])
      else:
        encrypted.append(char)
    return ''.join(encrypted)
```
This code defines a function `encrypt` that takes a string `s` as input and outputs a string encrypted using the rotated alphabet method described in the prompt. 

The script first creates an empty list called `encrypted` to store the encrypted characters. It also defines the standard alphabet which is later rotated to define the `rotated_alphabet`. The `for` loop goes through each character in the string `s`, and if the character is in the alphabet, it finds its rotated equivalent in the `rotated_alphabet` and appends it to `encrypted`. If the character is not in the alphabet, it's appended to `encrypted` as is. Finally, the function returns the joined string. 

This solution is self-contained and can be executed independently, and also passes the tests proposed in the prompt.
