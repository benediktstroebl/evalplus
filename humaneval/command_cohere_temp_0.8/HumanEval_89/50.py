```python
def encrypt(s):
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    encrypted = ''

    for char in s:
        offset = ord(char) + 2 * (ord(char) // 2)
        encryptedChar = chr(offset % 26 + 97)
        encrypted += encryptedChar

    return encrypted
```

This Python script defines a function `encrypt` taking a string `s` as input and returning an encrypted string using a rotated alphabet scheme. The algorithm:
- Starts with an empty encrypted string.
- Iterates through each character `char` in the input string `s`.
- Calculates an offset for each character by adding 2 raised to the power of its ASCII value, then adding another 2 to the result. This offset represents the rotated position in the alphabet.
- Converts the offset back to a character using the base alphabet, wrapping around if necessary, and appends it to the `encrypted` string.

The script essentially encodes each character in the input with a rotated alphabet, resulting in an encrypted string.
