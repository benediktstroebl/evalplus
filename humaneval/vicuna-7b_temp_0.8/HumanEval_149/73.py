    should return the list sorted by that rule.

    The function should return a list of strings in sorted order.
    You may assume that all words will have the same length.
    For example:
    assert list_sort(["aa", "a", "aaa"]) => ["aa"]
    assert list_sort(["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"]) => ["ab", "cd"]
