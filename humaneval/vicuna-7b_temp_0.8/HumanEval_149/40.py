    The list is always a list of strings and never an array of numbers,
    and it may contain duplicates.

    should return the list sorted by that rule.

    You may assume that all words will have the same length.
    For example:
    assert list_sort(["aa", "a", "aaa"]) => ["aa"]
    assert list_sort(["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"]) => ["ab", "cd"]
