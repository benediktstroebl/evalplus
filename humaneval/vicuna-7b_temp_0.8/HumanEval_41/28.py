    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.

    # This is a common scenario in competitive programming where you have to find
    # a solution in a very short amount of time.  You should get a feel for it
    # and try to optimize your time as much as possible.

    # To check the validity of a solution, you can use the O(n) time approach.

    # The time complexity of this approach is O(n) on average, as you have to check
    # the validity of every possible solution.  However, this is not optimal, as you
    # have to check the validity of a solution more than once for each valid solution.

    # To optimize the time complexity, you can use the dynamic programming approach.
    # This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2), but it's more efficient.

    # The dynamic programming approach has a time complexity of O(n^2), but it's more efficient.

    # The basic idea of the dynamic programming approach is to create a 2D array
    # of size n x n.  For each cell, you put the number of valid solutions for that
    # position.  You then fill in the rows below it by checking if the previous row
    # has a valid solution.  This is done by adding or subtracting the number of
    # valid solutions from the previous row, depending on whether or not the current
    # cell has a valid solution.

    # Here's the actual code for the dynamic programming approach:

    # Initialize a 2D array of size n x n
    # where the first row is the number of valid solutions for each cell.

    grid = [[1] * n for _ in range(n)]

    # Set the grid value for the first cell, which is the only valid solution.

    grid[0][0] = 1

    # Fill in the rest of the grid using the recursive approach.

    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            # Check if the current cell has a valid solution

            if grid[i-1][j-1] == 1:
                grid[i][j] = grid[i-1][j-1]
            else:
                grid[i][
