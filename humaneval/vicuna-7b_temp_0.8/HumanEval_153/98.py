def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    """You will be given the name of a class (a string) and a list of extensions.
    The extensions are to be used to load additional classes to the class. The
    strength of the extension is as follows: Let CAP be the number of the uppercase
    letters in the extension's name, and let SM be the number of lowercase letters 
    in the extension's name, the strength is given by the fraction CAP - SM. 
    You should find the strongest extension and return a string in this 
    format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.
    If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, you should
    choose the one that comes first in the list.
    For example, if you are given "Slices" as the class and a list of the
    extensions: ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'] then you should
    return 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes' since 'SErviNGSliCes' is the strongest extension 
    (its strength is -1).
    Example:
    for Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC']) == 'my_class.AA'

    # There are several ways to do this, but this is one way.
    # You can use a list of tuples where each tuple represents the strength and the
    # extension name, then sort the list by strength and take the first element
    # You can do this by sorting the list of tuples by the tuple's second element
    # and taking the first element.
    
    # You can use a dictionary where the keys are the extension names and the values
    # are the strengths, then you can use the keys to get the extension names and
    # the values to get the strengths. Then you can use the sorting function
    # to sort the dictionary by strength and take the first element.
    
    # You can use a list of tuples where the tuples contain the extension name and
    # the strength, then you can use the list comprehension to sort the list
    # by strength and take the first element.
    
    # You can use a list of tuples where the tuples contain the extension name and
    # the strength, then you can use the lambda function to sort the list by strength
    # and take the first element.
    
    # You can use the heapq.heappush(heap, (0, extension)) where 0 is the strength
    # and extension is the extension name, then you can use the heapq.heappop(heap)
    # to get the extension name and use the tuple unpacking to get the strength
    
    # You can use the min function to find the minimum element and use the index
    # of the element to get the extension name and the strength
    
    # You can use the max function to find the maximum element and use the index
    # of the element to get the extension name and the strength
    
    # You can use the sorted function to find the strongest extension and use the
    # index of the first element to get the extension name and the strength
    
    # You can use the max function to find the maximum element and use the tuple
    # unpacking to get the extension name and the strength
    
    # You can use the min function to find the minimum element and use the tuple
    # unpacking to get the extension name and the strength
    
    # You can use the max
