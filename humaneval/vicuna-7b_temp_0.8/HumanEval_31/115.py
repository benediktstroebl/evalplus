    # A prime number is defined as an integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself.
    # To test for primality, we can simply check if the number has any factors other than 1 and itself.
    # For example, if n is 6, then it has the factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.
    # Therefore, we can return False for any number that has any factors other than 1 and itself.
    # Note that this test is not perfect, since it will incorrectly identify some composite numbers as prime.
    # However, it is a simple and efficient test that works for small to medium-sized numbers.
    # For very large numbers, we may want to use a more advanced test such as the Miller-Rabin primality test.
    # However, the Miller-Rabin test is not necessary for the purposes of this program.
