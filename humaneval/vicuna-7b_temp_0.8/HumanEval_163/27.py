    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a
    and b, in ascending order.

    For example:
    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]
    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]
    generate_integers(10, 14) => []

    # Perform the following steps on the difference between a and b
    # to get the even digits in ascending order:
    #  1. Take the modulus of a with 2 to get the first digit.
    #  2. Multiply the first digit by 2 and add the result to a and
    #     subtract the result from b. This will give the second digit.
    #  3. Repeat step 2 for all digits until b is reached.
    #  4. Take the max of the remaining digits.
    #  5. If the max is greater than b, subtract it from a.
    #  6. Return the remaining digits in ascending order.

    # The outer loop counts down from b to a, while the inner loop
    # performs the calculations for each digit.
