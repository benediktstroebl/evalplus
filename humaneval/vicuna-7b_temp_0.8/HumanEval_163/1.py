    """
    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a
    and b, in ascending order.

    For example:
    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]
    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]
    generate_integers(10, 14) => []

    # For integers a and b, we can use the following approach to generate
    # the even digits between a and b:
    #
    #   result = []
    #   while b - a >= 2:
    #       digit = (a + b // 2) % 10
    #       result.append(digit)
    #       a, b = b, a + 2
    #   result.append(a % 10)
    #   return result
    #
    # However, this approach has a time complexity of O(log(b)) in the worst
    # case, which is slow for large values of a and b.
    #
    # Instead, we can use the following approach to generate the even digits
    # between a and b in O(1) time:
    #
    #   result = []
    #   while b - a >= 2:
    #       digit = (a + b // 2) % 10
    #       result.append(digit)
    #       a, b = b, a + 2
    #
    #   if a % 2 == 0:
    #       result.append(a % 10)
    #   return result
    #
    # This approach works by using a while loop to iterate through the digits
    # between a and b, and appending the even digits to the result list.
    # We keep track of the remainder of a divided by 2 in the variable r,
    # and check whether r is equal to 0. If r is equal to 0, we append the
    # remainder of a divided by 10 to the result list.
    #
    # The time complexity of this approach is O(1), which makes it much
    # faster than the previous approach for large values of a and b.
