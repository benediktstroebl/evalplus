def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    '''
    # Check if the three sides are in the correct ratio
    if (a/b).evalf() != (b/c).evalf():
        return False
    else:
        return True

print(right_angle_triangle(5, 12, 13))  # should print True
\end{code}

This code should work as expected, however, it is not efficient enough as it calculates the ratio of two sides multiple times. To improve its performance, we can use the `sympy` library, which allows us to perform mathematical operations on expressions.

Here's an improved version of the code:
