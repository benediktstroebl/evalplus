Answer: The problem with the code is that the list `result` is being appended with the string `"the number of odd elements %sn the str%s nd of the ndput."` before the loop that checks for odd elements in each string. So, when the loop checks for odd elements in the string, it is appending the same string to the list.

To fix this issue, you can append the result of formatting the count of odd elements to the list inside the loop that checks for odd elements.

Here's the corrected code:
