def smallest_change(arr):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

    For example:
    smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0
    """
    # If all the numbers in the array are equal, then we can't make any changes.
    if arr.count(arr[0]) == len(arr):
        return 0

    # If the array is already palindromic, we don't need to make any changes.
    if arr == arr[::-1]:
        return 0

    # If the array is not palindromic, we need to make changes.
    # We can make changes by adding elements to the array or removing elements from the array.
    # We can also swap elements with each other.

    # To find the minimum number of changes, we need to find the smallest difference between the array and its palindromic version.
    # The smallest difference is the minimum number of changes that need to be made.

    # One possible way to do this is to create a new array that is the palindromic version of the original array.
    # Then, we can find the smallest difference between these two arrays.

    # To create the palindromic version of the array, we can start by finding the middle element of the array.
