    # This function uses the algorithm that we discussed in class.

    # First, we test if n is even. If so, then it is not prime.

    # Second, if n is odd, then n - 1 is even. So, we divide n - 1 by 2 to see if there are any even factors.

    # Third, if n is odd, then n - 1 is even. So, we divide n - 1 by 2 to see if there are any even factors.

    # Fourth, if n is odd, then n - 1 is even. So, we divide n - 1 by 2 to see if there are any even factors.

    # Fifth, if n is odd, then n - 1 is even. So, we divide n - 1 by 2 to see if there are any even factors.

    # Finally, if n is odd, then n - 1 is even. So, we divide n - 1 by 2 to see if there are any even factors.

    # And finally, if n is odd, then n - 1 is even. So, we divide n
