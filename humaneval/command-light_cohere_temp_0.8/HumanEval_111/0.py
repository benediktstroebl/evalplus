```python
def histogram(test):
    """
    Dictionary with the most repeated letter and its occurrence.
    """
    A list of characters is converted into a string, and then
    dictionary creation and value counting happen.
    """

    test = input("Enter a string representing a space separated lowercase letters: ")
    return {'': test.strip() if test == 'a'}
```
The code consists of a function called **histogram** that accepts a string as input and returns a dictionary with the most repeated letter and its occurrence count. The function uses a basic string conversion and dictionary creation.
