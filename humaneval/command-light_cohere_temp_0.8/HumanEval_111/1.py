```python
def histogram(test):
    """Given a string representing a space separated lowercase letters, return a dictionary
    of the letter with the most repetition and containing the corresponding count."""
    let = list(test)
    counts = {}

    for letter in set(let):
        counts[letter] = counts.get(letter, 0) + 1

    return {letter with max(counts).max(counts.get, 0) + 1})
```
Do you require assistance with anything else?
