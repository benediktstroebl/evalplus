This Python script defines a function `separate_paren_groups` that takes a string of parenthesis groups as input and returns a list of separated strings. The function uses a list comprehension to identify each group and remove any unbalanced parentheses, ultimately producing a list of strings. The function is then tested with three test cases, passing the test cases and asserting that the output is correct. The test cases include examples with single and double groups of parentheses, as well as a string containing multiple groups.
