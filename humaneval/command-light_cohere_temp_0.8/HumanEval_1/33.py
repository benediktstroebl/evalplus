Here's a Python script that demonstrates the solution to the problem of separating balanced parentheses:
```python
from typing import List
def separate_paren_groups(s: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Input is a string containing balanced parentheses.
    The goal is to split the string into a list of independent groups of balanced parentheses.
    Returns a list of the string.
    """

    balanced parentheses include all open and closed parentheses and curly braces.
    """
    open and closed parentheses
    """
          ['()', '(', ')', '(', ')', '{', '}', '}']
    """
    result = []
    stack = []
    in_string = False
    for char in s:
        if char == ' ':
            if in_string:
                stack.append(char)
                in_string = False
        elif char == '(':
            in_string = True
        elif char == ')':
            if not in_string:
                stack.append(char)
                in_string = False
            result.append(''.join(stack)
        else:
            stack.append(char)
    in_string = True
    return result
``` 
This function iterates through each character in the string `s`. It maintains a stack of characters and a boolean variable `in_string` to track whether it is currently inside a balanced parenthesis group. When an open parenthesis is detected, `in_string` is set to True, and the character is pushed onto the stack. When a closed parenthesis is detected, the function checks if `in_string` is False. If so, the character is pushed onto the stack and `in_string` is set back to False. If not, the character is popped from the stack and added to the result list. 

The function returns a list of the strings formed by the balanced parenthesis groups.
