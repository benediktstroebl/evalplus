```python
from typing import List
def separate_paren_groups(s: str) -> List[str]:
    # You got it! Not so fast.
    return [ strings = [s.split()
    DONE
    for string in strings if string.startswith('('(') and string.endswith(')') and not string.startswith('+')]
    strings = [string for string in strings if string.startswith('('(') and string.endswith(')')] 
    return strings
```
This code is a function that splits a string into a list of substrings. It does this by checking if a string starts with '(' and ends with ') and is not ')', in which case it returns that string.
