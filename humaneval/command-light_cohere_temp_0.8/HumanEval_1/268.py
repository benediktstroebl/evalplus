    """
    This function takes a list of strings as input, representing a list of parenthesis groups. 
    Each string in the separated by spaces, a group of open and closed parentheses.

        for char in '([{])']. Replace all open parenthesis with the appropriate close parenthesis.
    return ''.join(string.Make each string in parentheses list a list of strings, with correctly separated and balanced parentheses.
