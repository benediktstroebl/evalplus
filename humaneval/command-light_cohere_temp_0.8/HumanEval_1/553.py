```python
def separate_paren_groups(s: str) -> List[str]:
    result = []
    stack = []
    for char in s:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(char)
        else:
            if not stack or stack[-1] == '):':
                result.append(char)
                stack = stack[:-1]
    return result
``` 
This function uses a stack data structure to keep track of open parentheses. It iterates through each character in the string, and when an ')' character is encountered, it appends it to the stack. When an ')' is reached without an open parenthesis in the stack, it means that we've reached the end of a parenthes group, so we add the character to the result list and reset the stack. 
Finally, the function returns a list of the separated and balanced parentheses.
