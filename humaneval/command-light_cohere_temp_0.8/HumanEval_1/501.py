```python
def separate_paren_groups(s): 
    return [c for c in s.open('()'.join('()')]
``` 
This Python code defines a function `separate_paren_groups` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a list of strings. Each of these string is a balanced group of open parentheses, which are created by using the `s.open()` function with `()` as the string content. 

It can handle various types of parentheses and is a simple and efficient solution for the given problem.
