Here is a self-contained Python script that includes a function called `separate_paren_groups`, which solves the problem of separating and unravelling parentheses in a given string:
```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(s: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    This function takes a string containing multiple groups of parentheses as input and returns a list of separated strings, with balanced and properly nested parentheses.
    """
    balanced (balanced = True)"""
    return [p.strip() for p in s.balanced for p in s.balanced.balanced = nots balanced and open parenthesis is correctly nested)
    [') + [')', '()()', '()()]'
    return []
```
The function works by using a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string. Each character is in the string is then transformed into a tuple of an opening parenthesis and a closing parenthesis, which is then added to the list of balanced parentheses if the current character is not the correct opening parenthesis.
