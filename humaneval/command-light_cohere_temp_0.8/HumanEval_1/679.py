```python
from typing import List
def separate_paren_groups(parentheses: List[str]) -> List[str]:
    """ Function to separate and return groups of parentheses.
    : Returns a balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
    :param parenthes: List of strings containing parenthesis groups
    :return: List of strings with each group of parentheses separated
    """
    # Use str.maketransverse() to split the list of strings into individual characters.
    # Use list of characters and convert them into a list of strings
    return [char for char in str.maketransverse(parentheses)]
```
Now, you have a function that splits a list of parenthesis-containing strings into a list of individual characters, which are separated by spaces.
