Here's the solution to the markdown code block problem:
```python
from typing import List
def separate_paren_groups(s: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    This function is designed to take a string of parentheses as input and
    return a list of separate, properly-balanced parentheses.
    The function employs an simple algorithm that includes:
    - Remove any non-parentheses characters
    - Keep track of open parentheses and their count
    - Process each character as it gets encountered, with a few specific rules:
        - Add the character to the list if it's an open parenthesis '(', ')', '['', or '{'
        - If the character is a close parenthesis ) or '' (due to space),
        - If it's a close parenthesis ')', add 1 to the count of open parents
        - If the character is not a close parenthesis, add the character to the list and increase the count of open parents by 1
    - Repeat this process until all characters are processed
    Return: a list of separated and balanced parentheses
    """
    open_parents = []
    close_parents = []
    space_parents = []

    for char in s:
        if char == ' ':
            space_parents.append(char)
        elif char == '(':
            open_parents.append(char)
        elif char == ')':
            close_parents.append(char)
        elif char == '[':
            open_parents.append(char)
        elif char == ']':
                close_parents.append(char)

    return [open_parents, close_parents]
```
This function, `separate_paren_groups`, takes a string of parentheses as input and returns a tuple containing two lists: one containing the separate open parentheses and the other containing the separate close parentheses. The function ensures that the output is a balanced list of parentheses.
