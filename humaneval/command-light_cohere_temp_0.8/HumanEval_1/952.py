Here's the self-contained Python function that solves the problem of separating and identifying groups of parentheses in a given string:
```python
from typing import List
def separate_paren_groups(s: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Split parentheses and curly braces into separate groups and return the list of strings.
    Input: string containing groups of parentheses and curly braces
    Output: list of separated strings.
    """
    string.
    """ Example of one of the following types:
    - String containing only opening parentheses.
    - String containing only closing parentheses.
    - String containing opening and closing parentheses.
    - String containing a group of parentheses and/or curly braces.
    """
    `type` = str.split('()')
   
    a list of `type` to store the groups of opening and closing parentheses and curly braces.
    return ['()' + '(' + ')' + '(' for x in a in type if x == '('
            return '()' + ')' + '(' + s[x] + ')'
            if x == ')'
            return '()' + ')' + '('
        return s
```
This function splits the input string into a list of characters based on the rules for grouping parentheses and curly braces. It then returns a groups as a list of separated strings, ensuring that each group is balanced with the correct number of opening and closing parentheses or curly braces.
