Here's the self-contained Python function that solves the problem of separating different groups of parentheses:
```python
from typing import List
def separate_paren_groups(s: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Separate balanced parentheses from the string.
    Returns a balanced parentheses as a list of separate strings.
    """
    open, close = iterates through the string, creating groups of closed and open parentheses, then joins the next group with a space.
    """return [['('.')(')', '()', '[]', '()', '()', '()')['()']
```
This function takes a string s as input and returns a list of separate strings, each containing a balanced group of parentheses. The function uses the balanced group as the only argument to the function, and then calls the iterates over the string using open, close to create groups. The function then joins the join the next group with a space and store it in the list. The next open parenthesis is added to the list and the process continues until there are no open parenthesis left in the string.
