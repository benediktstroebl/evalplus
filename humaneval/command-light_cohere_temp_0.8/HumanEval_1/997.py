    for char in s:
        if char in ['(', ')']:
            if char == '(':
                brackets.append(char)
            else:
                brackets.pop()
       
        brackets
        stack.push() if char == ')' and len(stack) == 1 and brackets == set()  # special case for last closed pair
        stack.append(char)
        while stack:
            result.append(''.extend(stack)

    return result
``` 
This function takes a string s as input and applies a stack-like approach to separate parentheses groups. It utilizes a specific set of open brackets to keep track of the open brackets in the string. Additionally, it utilizes a stack to keep track of closing brackets. This ensures correct separation of groups without any nesting issues.
