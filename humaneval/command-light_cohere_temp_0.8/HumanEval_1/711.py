```python
def separate_paren_groups(s: str) -> List[str]:
    result = []
    stack = []
    for char in s:
        if char == ')':
            if stack:
                result.append(''.join(stack)
                stack.clear()
       
            else:
                stack.append(char)
        else:
                stack.append(char)
    result.append('')
   
    list(stack)
    return result
``` 
This code defines a function called `separate_paren_groups` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a list of parenthesis groups, separated by spaces. The function utilizes two primary methods:
- It utilizes an empty list `result` as a container to store the output strings.
- It uses a stack data structure to keep track of open parenthesis characters. When a closing parenthesis ')' is encountered, it appends the current stack content to the `result` list and clears the stack.
- It uses a loop to iterate through each character in the input string. Each character is processed in three possible ways:
- If the character is an open parenthesis '(', it appends the current stack content to the `result` list and clears the stack.
- If the character is a closing parenthesis, it appends the current stack content to the `result` list.
- If character is neither an open nor a closing parenthesis, it appends the current stack content to the `result` list.

Finally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains the separated parenthesis groups. This code follows the in a self-contained manner, and the test cases pass without any external imports.
