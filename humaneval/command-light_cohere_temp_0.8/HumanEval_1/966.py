```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(s: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    This function takes a string of parentheses and returns a list of separate parenthesis groups.

    It returns a each group of parentheses properly balanced.
    The list of the separated string groups.
    """
    list comprehension with string splitting is used to accomplish this.
    """
    balanced groups of parentheses are returned as the list. 
```

The function uses a list comprehension to split the string into separate groups based on spaces. It then uses a list method to combine the balanced groups of parentheses into a list.
