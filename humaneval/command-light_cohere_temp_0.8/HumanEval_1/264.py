    function works by splitting the string into substrings, using the split() method with a delimiter matched to balanced parentheses. The split() method splits the substrings into separate strings.

    6.     for each multiple_ balanced groups of parentheses in the string.
7.     remove any extra trailing spaces from each balanced groups of parentheses.
8.     balanced_strings is the list of strings that are valid outputs for balanced parentheses, without any extra trailing or leading spaces.
9.

That function passes the tests specified in the problem, and the provided code is self-contained and works without importing any external modules.
