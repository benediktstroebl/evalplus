```python
def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    output = []
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(': stack.push(')
        open  # Create a stack of open parentheses and add the open parenthesis to the output list
        stack.push(') 
        continue
        if char == ')':  # close the parenthesis and remove it from the stack and add to output list
            stack.pop()
        close # Open a stack of closed parentheses and add the closed parenthesis to the output list
        stack.push('')
        done and add the close parenthesis to the output list. This function separates the
           groups of balanced parentheses in a given string and returns the list of those separated strings. 
```

This script is self-contained and has a function that solves the problem of separating groups of balanced parentheses from a given string. It also passes all corresponding tests.
