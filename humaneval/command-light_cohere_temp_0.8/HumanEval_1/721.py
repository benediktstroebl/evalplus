Here's the self-contained Python script that solves the problem of separating out and unbalanced parentheses in a string:
```python
def separate_paren_groups(s: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Separates groups of balanced and unbalanced parentheses from the input string.
    """
    Input is a string of characters, including balanced and unbalanced parentheses.
    Returns a balanced parentheses as separate strings.
    """
    first unbalanced parenthesis found, and then returns the string containing only the balanced parentheses.
    """
    balanced parentheses:
    - It starts with an empty stack.
    - The open parenthesis and push it to the stack.
    - If more parenthesis found.
    - If open parenthesis and pop the last one from the stack.
    - Repeat the until no more parenthesis is found.
    - All remaining characters in the string are balanced parentheses.
    """ unbalanced parenthesis:
    - If no more balanced parentheses found, it means there are only unbalanced ones left.
    - Create a balanced parentheses string with the remaining unbalanced ones.
    - Return the string as a list of strings containing only balanced parentheses.
    """ The remaining characters in the string.
```
This solution uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening parentheses and a simple if condition to identify the type of each character. The function returns a list of strings containing only the balanced parentheses.
