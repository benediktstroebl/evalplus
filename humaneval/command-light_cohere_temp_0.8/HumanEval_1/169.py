```python
from typing import List
def separate_paren_groups(s: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    A function to separate groups of nested parentheses.
    Returns a balanced groups of parentheses as separate strings.
    """:
        return [char(p) for p in s if p.is_balanced_balanced_pair()]
    """
    return [char for char in s if char.is_balanced_paired()]
```
This function takes a string s as input and returns a list of strings, each containing a balanced group of parentheses. The function uses a is a string s that may contain multiple groups of nested parentheses. The function uses a regular expression char to check if a character is a balanced pair, and returns the character if it is true. The function also uses the list comprehension to filter out only the characters that are balanced pairs, and returns the list of those characters.

The test cases are also self-contained within the function, so you can use this function directly without needing to import it into another script.
