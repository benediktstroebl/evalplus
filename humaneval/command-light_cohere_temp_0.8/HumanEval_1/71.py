This function is designed to handle a string of characters, with the goal of splitting the string into individual groups of balanced parentheses. The function starts by iterating through the input string, and as it encounters a ')', it checks if there's a corresponding ''. If there is, it appends the pair to the result list, and pop it from the stack. Then, it appends the char to the stack, which represents the opening ')' of the current group. The function keeps appending characters to the stack until it encounters a ')', and then appends the last character in the stack to the result list and pop it from the stack. This process effectively separates the
