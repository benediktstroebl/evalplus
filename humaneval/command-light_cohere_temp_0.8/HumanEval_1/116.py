Here's the solution to the Markdown code block problem:
```python
from typing import List
def separate_paren_groups(s: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Separates and returns each group of parentheses in a string.
    >>>Example:
    Input: (( (;))(\ Beck ) )))
    Output: [('();', '(\ Beck )')
    """
    stack: List[str] = []
    for char in s:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(') ')**char
        elif char == ')':
            if len(stack) == 0:
                stack.append('(')
            else:
                stack.pop()
                stack.push(')'.char)*'
return stack
```

This function uses a stack to keep track of open parentheses. It iterates through input string character by character and checks if it's an open parenthesis. If it is, it appends a copy of the closing parenthesis to the stack and then push the character back. If the stack is empty when a closing parenthesis is encountered, it means there are no more open parentheses left, so we can append the string representing the group to the output list. If there is open parentheses left in the string, we use the 'pop()' method to remove the last element from the stack. This way makes sure that we correctly separate the group of parentheses.
