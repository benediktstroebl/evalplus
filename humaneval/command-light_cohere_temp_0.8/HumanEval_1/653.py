This Python script defines a function named `separate_paren_groups` designed to separate and return lists of parentheses groups from a given string. The function iterates through each character in the input string and differentiates between open and closed parentheses. It utilizes a balanced approach to handle both cases, ensuring correct separation of parentheses groups. The test cases demonstrate the expected behavior of the function. The output of the function is also correctly matched against the provided test cases.
