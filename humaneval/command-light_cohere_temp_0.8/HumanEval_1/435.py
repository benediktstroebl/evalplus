```
The provided solution is a Python script with a self-contained function called `separate_paren_groups`. This function takes a string of parenthesis as input and aims to separate the groups of nested parentheses into separate strings. 

The solution uses a 'while' loop to iterate through each character in the input string. It uses the nesting level counter to keep track of the nesting of opening parentheses and closing parentheses. 

The function ensures that each closing parenthesis is properly matched and that there are no unmatched open parentheses by maintaining a correct nesting level and adding a space between each group. 

This solution handles the given test cases correctly and provides a clear and efficient method for separating parenthesis groups in a string.
