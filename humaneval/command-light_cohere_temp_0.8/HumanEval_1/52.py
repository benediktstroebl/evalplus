This Python script defines a function named `separate_paren_groups` that separates groups of parentheses into separate strings. It uses a balanced approach to handle different number of closing parentheses. The function iterates through each character in the string, if it's a left parenthesis it's added to the results list, and if it's a right parenthesis it's added with an escaped ')' to the list. 

The script also includes a set of test cases, which are passed to the function to test its correctness. The test cases ensure that the function returns the expected results for different input strings containing parentheses.
