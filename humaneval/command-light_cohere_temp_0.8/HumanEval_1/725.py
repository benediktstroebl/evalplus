```python
from typing import List
def separate_paren_groups(parentheses: List[str]) -> List[str]:
    """
    Input to this function is a list of strings containing multiple groups of parentheses. Your goal is separating those groups into separate strings and return the list of those strings.
    """
    balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
    """
    return [p.strip() for p in parentheses]
``` 
Do you require any additional assistance with this or other Python-related topics?
