This Python script defines a function named `separate_paren_groups` that takes a string `s` as input and aims to separate balanced parentheses from it. The function removes spaces from the string and then iterates over each character, identified as the start of a potential group. If the character is ')' or '(', it is added to the `result` list, indicating a balanced group of parentheses. The function effectively separates and returns a list of balanced parentheses.
