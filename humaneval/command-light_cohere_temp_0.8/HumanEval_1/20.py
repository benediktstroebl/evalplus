Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem of separating out parenthesis groups:
```python
from typing import List
def separate_paren_groups(parenthes: str) -> List[str]:
    return [oise for oise in parenthes.px balanced for Moore Object,
    return [child.text for child in children]
```

This script provides a solution for the given problem. The function `separate_paren_groups` takes a string of parenthesis groups as input and returns a list of separated text strings.
