Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you outlined:
```python
def separate_paren_groups(parentheses: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Separate groups of balanced parentheses into individual strings.
    """
    the groups of balanced parentheses into individual strings and returns the list of those strings.
    """
    balanced () pairs must be escaped to ( )
    """
    result = []
    for match in parentheses:
        escaped_pair = match[0] + ')'
        result.append(escaped_pair)
    return result
```
This function takes a string of parentheses as input and returns a list of individual strings, each representing a balanced group of parentheses. The function loops through each match in the input string and adds the matched pair to the result list, ensuring that each opening pair is properly escaped with a trailing ).
