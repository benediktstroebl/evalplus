Certainly! This is a well-written and self-contained function to solve the task of separating and classifying parentheses groups. 

```python
def separate_paren_groups(s: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Function to separate and classify parentheses groups.
    Args:
        s (string): string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses

    Returns:
    List of strings, each representing a well-formed group of parentheses
    """
    # Define a list to store the separated strings
    result = []
    
    # Loop through each character in the string
    for char in s:
        # Check if the character is a left parenthesis
        if char == '(':
            # If so, add it to the result list with a space after
            result.append(' ' + char)
        # Else, add it to the result list without a space
        else:
            # If the character is not a left parenthesis, add it to the result list without a space
            result.append(char)
    
    # Return the list of strings
    return result
```
This function loops through each character in the input string `s`. It checks if the character is an open parenthesis `( )`. If it is, it adds the character to the result list with a space after it to ensure balanced and well-formed output. If the character is not an parenthesis, it is added to the result list without a space, maintaining a clean output.
