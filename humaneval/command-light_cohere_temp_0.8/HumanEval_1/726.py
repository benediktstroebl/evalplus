The code provided above is a Python script that contains a function called `separate_paren_groups` which solves the problem stated in the prompt. It takes the string input as its parameter and returns a list of strings with balanced parentheses. The function uses a list comprehension to filter out only the characters that are valid parentheses in the given string.
