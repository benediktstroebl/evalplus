Certainly, here's a self-contained Python script that implements the `separate_paren_groups` function, which is intended to separate groups of parentheses into separate strings:
```python
from typing import List
def separate_paren_groups(parentheses: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses.
    Separate groups while balancing each open brace is properly closed and not nested within the other groups.
    Returns a simple string of balanced parentheses separated by spaces.
    """
    example:
    >>> separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')
    ['()', '(())', '(()())']
    """
    result = []
    balance = True
    for char in parentheses:
        if char == '(':
            result.append('(')
            balance = not balance
        elif char == ')':
            balance = True
        else:
            balance = False
        if not balance:
            result.append(' ')
    result.append(char)
    balance = not balance
    return result
``` 
This script defines a function that takes a string of parentheses as input and returns a list of separate strings created by balancing the open braces. 
It uses a loop to iterate through each character in the input string, and maintains a balance flag to track whether an open parenthesis is followed by a closing parenthesis. If the balance is not maintained, a space is added to ensure the proper separation.
