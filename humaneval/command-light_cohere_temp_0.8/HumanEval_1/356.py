```python
from typing import List
def separate_paren_groups(s: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in s.string() if ')' in s and s. imbalance() == ')' and '(' in s and s.open() == '(']
```
This Python code defines a function called `separate_paren_groups` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a list of substrings extracted from the input string. The function uses a `s.soft` matching to identify and extract valid parentheses from the string and filter them out. The function uses the pattern matching to identify balanced parentheses and their opening counterpart. 

The function works by iterating over the characters of the input string using a generator expression. It checks for the pattern `(`)`) in s and `()` in s. The result of the function is a list of substrings that have been separated from other parenthesis and opened parentheses.
