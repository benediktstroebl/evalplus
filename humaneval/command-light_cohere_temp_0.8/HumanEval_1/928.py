Here's the self-contained Python script that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List
def separate_paren_groups(s: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Separate and return groups of well-formed parentheses.
    Return a balanced parentheses as a list of strings.
    """
    string.
    """
    strings of only balanced and well-formed parentheses
    """
    # Create a stack to keep track of opening parentheses
    stack = []
    
    # Iterate over the characters in the string
    for char in s:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack or stack[-1] != '(':
                raise ValueError("Unexpected character in parentheses")
            opening_par = stack.pop()
            closing_par = ')'
            # If the stack is empty or the top item is not an opening parent,
            # add it to the output and clear the stack
            yield [opening_par] + [closing_par]
            stack.clear()
        opened, closed)
            # If the stack is not empty, add the next character to it
            stack.append(char)
    
    # If an error occurs during the processing, return empty list instead of error
    # Convert the list of strings into a list of characters
    return list(''.
``` 
This function will take a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses and separate them into separate strings, ensuring balanced and properly formed parentheses.
