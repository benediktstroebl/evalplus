The `separate_paren_groups` function accepts a string that contains many brackets and returns a list of separated brackets. The purpose of the function is to correct and organized a string of brackets, which may contain nested or unbalanced groups.

The test cases are also enclosed in the `test_cases` list, which contains a variety of scenarios, including balanced and unbalanced brackets.

This code will verify that the `separate_paren_groups` function returns the correct result for each test case.

Note: To run the script, save it in a file, for example, `separate_parentheses.py`, and then Python file and then run it using the Python interpreter in your terminal.
