The provided code defines a Python script with a function called `separate_paren_groups` that separates and outputs groups of parentheses into individual strings. The function takes a test case strings that include nested and balanced parentheses. It handles complex cases correctly and passes all test cases. The test cases are structured, and the function's behavior is validated against these cases to ensure accuracy. Finally, the output is printed to the console, showing the results of the function's execution with the test cases.
