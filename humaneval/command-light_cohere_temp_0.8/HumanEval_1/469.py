The code you provided is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of separating groups of balanced parentheses into individual strings. The function, `separate_paren_groups`, takes a list of strings as input and returns a list of strings. The function works by identifying groups of balanced parentheses and separating them into individual strings. The function then passes the test data and prints the expected output.
