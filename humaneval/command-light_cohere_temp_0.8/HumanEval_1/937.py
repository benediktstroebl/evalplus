This script defines a function called `separate_paren_groups` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list of strings, where each string represents a group of parentheses. The function first checks that the input is a list of strings and that each string in the list is also a valid parentheses string. Then, it uses the string splitting technique to separate the input string into a list of characters, and filters out any spaces from the list of characters. The function then reassembles each group of characters into a single string and adds it to the output list. 

Note that this script has been optimized for performance by using a performance-based string-splitting method.  The string-split method is more efficient than using a `for` loop and `split()` method.   The string-split method uses an internal function to create a new string with the same contents as the original string, but with a new character at the end of the string.
