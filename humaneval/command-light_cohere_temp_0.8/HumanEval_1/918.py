``` 
This Python code defines a function called `separate_paren_groups` that takes a string of characters as input and returns a list of distinct parenthesis-grouped strings. The function uses regular expressions to split the input string into groups of closing parentheses. The test cases section ensures that the function works correctly by passing the test strings and checking if the returned result matches the expected output. Finally, the code prints a message indicating that all tests have passed.
