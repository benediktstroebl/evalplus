```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(s: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    This function is designed to take a string of parenthesis-enclosed groups and
    return them as separate strings.
    """
    balance = [', '()', '{}', '[]', '()', '{', '(', ')']
    return [match for match in s.match('\b'.join(balance, '('))\b'.strip() for i in range(1, 10)]
```
This Python function named `separate_paren_groups` takes a string `s` as input and is designed to split the string into separate strings by breaking open parentheses. The function utilizes the balance variable, which contains a list of character sequences that represent different types of open parentheses. The function iterates through this approach to match open parentheses in the string, using the `match` function to locate and extract them. Finally, the extracted groups of parentheses are stripped of any extra whitespace characters.
