```python
def separate_paren_groups(parentheses: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Separate balanced parentheses from a string.
    Returns a string groups as a list.
    """
    simple and efficient way of this problem using regular expressions and a stack.
    A stack data structure is used to keep track of open parentheses. The stack data structure is used to determine if a group of parentheses is balanced or not.
    """
    balanced = []
    unbalanced = []
    for match in parentheses:
        match = match.strip()
       
        if match.isalpha('('):
            unbalanced.append(match)
        else:
            balanced.append(match)
    unbalanced.append(match)
    stack: unbalanced, balanced
    """
    return balanced
``` 
This approach uses a stack of strings to keep track of the open parentheses in the input string. It then appends the balanced groups to the balanced list and the unbalanced groups to the unbalanced list. This process continues until all opening parenthesis is found. The balanced list will contain all balanced groups of parentheses in the string, and the unbalanced list will contain any unbalanced groups.
