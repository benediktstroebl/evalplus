    list comprehension is used to split the string into a list of balanced parentheses. Each balanced set of parentheses will be transformed into a string without spaces.

    The returned list of balanced parentheses is then transformed into a string without spaces. This transformation is done by converting the list of balanced parentheses back into a string using the `str()` method.

    list comprehension is a powerful and flexible tool for creating lists of elements.

The function has been successfully tested and is self-contained, as it does not require any external modules or functions to operate.
