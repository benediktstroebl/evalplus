Here's the code with a self-contained function:
```python
from typing import List
def separate_paren_groups(s: str) -> List[str]:
    return [p for p in s.language.replace(). numbers, separators and parentheses, brackets and other grouping symbols.
    ```
```

For test cases, a sample string is provided, which contains various parentheses and other grouping symbols. The 'separate_paren_groups' method accepts a string as input and creates a list of strings, each representing a group of parentheses.

The test cases cover a wide range of different possibilities, including nested and unbalanced groups.
