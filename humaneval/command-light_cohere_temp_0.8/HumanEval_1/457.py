Here's a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of separating nested parentheses:
```python
def separate_paren_groups(s: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    result = []
    for char in s:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack or stack[-1] != '(':
                result.append(char)
                stack.clear()
    structure.
        elif char == ' ':
            stack.append(char)
   
    result.append(')')
    structure
    return result
```

This function takes a string `s` as input and returns a list of separated parentheses. The function uses a stack data structure to keep track of opening parentheses and closes them when a closing parenthesis is encountered. The result list is then populated with the resulting separated characters.

This solution is self-contained and can be easily integrated into other Python projects as needed.
