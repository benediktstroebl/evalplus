```python
from typing import List
def separate_paren_groups(s: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    This function takes a string of parentheses as input and returns a list of the correctly separated groups of parentheses.
    """
   
    code demonstrates the structure of the function.
    The function first uses the string s as the input.
    It loops over the most character in the string using an index of a character as the starting point.
    Then it starts a process, if the current character is a '(', it checks if the next character is a ')', and if it is, it appends the current group to a new list.
    if it is next character is not a ')', the function appends the current character to the list. If it is a next character is a ')', the function appends the current character to the list, breaks out of the current group, and moves to the next character in the string.
    The process continues until the list is fully built.
    """
    final step, the function returns the list. 
```

This code uses the Python list to store the elements of each group of parentheses.
