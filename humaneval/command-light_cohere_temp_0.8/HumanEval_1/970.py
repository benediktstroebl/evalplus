```  This code defines a function called `separate_paren_groups` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list of strings, each representing a group of parentheses. It uses the specific logic to identify the groups of parentheses, space characters, and next openings. The output of this function will be a list of strings, each representing a balanced group of parentheses.
