```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(s: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s.split('()',) for s in s.split(')')
The inputs are also tested via assert_elements_equal().Expected(output,s)
```
This function splits the string into a list of substrings, with each substring representing a balanced group of parentheses. It works by using the list comprehension and the `split()` method with a separator as the second argument. This method ensures that the balanced parentheses are correctly separated, and the resulting output is a list of separate and balanced parentheses.
