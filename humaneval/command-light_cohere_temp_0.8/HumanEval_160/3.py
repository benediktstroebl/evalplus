The code defines a function `do_algebra` that evaluates a mathematical expression using basic arithmetic operations. The function takes two lists as input: `operator` represents a list of mathematical operators, and `operand` represents a list of numbers or variables. The function builds an mathematical expression using the provided operators and operands and evaluates it, returning the result. The code also includes a series of test cases, where the `do_algebra` function is called with different combinations of operators and operands to verify its correctness. The test cases cover a expected behavior of the function.
