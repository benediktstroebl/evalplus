    Given two lists operator, and operand.
    The first list has basic algebra operations, and 
    the second list is a list of integers.

```
In this code, we have a function do_algebra that takes two lists as input, where one list contains basic algebra operations and the other list contains integers. The function then checks if the list of operators has at least two elements and the list of operands has at least two elements. If both conditions are met, the function proceeds to test the validity of the expressions by evaluating them with the corresponding lists. The function also checks if the result of each of the basic operations is correct.
