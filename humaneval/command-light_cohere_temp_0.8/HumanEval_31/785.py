The function checks if a number is prime by first checking if the number is less than or equal to 1 and greater than 3, then it returns true. If the number is 2 or 3, it's a prime. If the number is divisible by 2 or 3, the function returns false. If the number is greater than 4 and its prime factorization has an even number of distinct prime factors, the function returns true. If the number has no such The factorization is greater than 4, the function loops through all the odd numbers between 4 and the square root of n, and if n is not divisible by any of these numbers, the function returns true.
