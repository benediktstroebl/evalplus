```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```
This code defines a function is_prime that checks whether a given number n is a prime or not. It starts by checking simple cases where the number is less than or equal to 2 or 3, then it checks for the number being even or odd, and if it is divisible by either 2 or 3, it returns False. If none of these specified conditions are met, it starts a loop from i = 5 and keeps incrementing i by 6 until the square of i is less than or equal to n. Finally, if none of these conditions are satisfied during the loop, it returns True, indicating that n is a prime number.
