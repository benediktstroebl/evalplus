```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```
The code defines a function **`is_prime`** that determines whether a given number is prime. It uses a specific tests to determine primality, such as checking for divisibility by 2, 3, and subsequent numbers up to the square root of the number, as well as determining if the number is divisible by any integer within a specific range. 

This function can be used to quickly and accurately determine whether a given number is prime or not, which is beneficial for a variety of applications involving prime numbers and related computations.
