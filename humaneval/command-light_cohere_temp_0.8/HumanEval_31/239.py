```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```

This function is designed to determine whether a given number n is a prime, which passes all the tests mentioned in the prompt. It first checks for numbers less than or equal to 1 and then checks for divisibility by 2 and 3, using simple conditions. After that, it uses the "fibonacci" method, where it iterates up to the square of the number while checking for divisibility by consecutive numbers starting from 5. 

Note that this function is self-contained and can be used to solve the problem for any given number.
