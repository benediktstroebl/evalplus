```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```
This code defines a function `is_prime` that checks whether a given number is prime or not. It first handles some special cases for small numbers, then employs an efficient trial division algorithm to determine primality. This algorithm is efficient because it only tests divisibility up to the square root of the number, which greatly reduces the number of iterations.
