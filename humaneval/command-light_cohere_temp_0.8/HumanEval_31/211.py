Here's the code that solves the provided markdown code block problem:
```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```
This function takes an integer n as input and checks whether it is prime or not. It uses a testing techniques to determine primality, such as checking divisibility by 2 and 3, as well as checking divisibility by numbers formed by consecutive prime numbers up to the square root of n.
