Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem of checking whether a number is prime, and passes all the tests provided:
```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```
This function `is_prime` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is a prime number and `False` otherwise. The function uses some Miller-Rabin primality test, which is a well-known algorithm to determine whether a given number is prime.

Note that, you can use this function to check if a given number is prime or not, and it passes all the tests provided.
