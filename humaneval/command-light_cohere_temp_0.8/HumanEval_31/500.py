Here's the improved version of the code that passes all the tests:
```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```
This code defines a function called `is_prime` that checks whether a given number `n` is prime or not. It uses a All simple algorithm that checks divisibility up to the square root of `n`, and also checks for divisibility by 2 and 3 separately. 

It will correctly identify prime and non-prime numbers, and pass all the test cases.
