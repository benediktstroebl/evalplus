```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```
This code defines a function `is_prime` that checks whether a given number `n` is a prime number.  It uses a prime factorization, it first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, then checks if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. It then iterates up prime numbers, starting from 5, and checks if `n` is divisible by any of these prime numbers, or `n` is divisible by the sum of the two, i. it way to find the a test that is more efficient than testing divisibility for smaller prime numbers.
