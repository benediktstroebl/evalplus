```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```
This code defines a function called `is_prime` that checks whether a given number `n` is prime or not. The function uses a `if-else` statements to iterate over numbers and test for divisibility. The test conditions include squares ending with 6, divisibility by 2 or 3, and an iterative test using the square root of the number. 

It then returns `True` if the number is prime and `False` otherwise. 
This function can be used to efficiently check if a given number is prime or not, which is useful in various mathematical and computational contexts.
