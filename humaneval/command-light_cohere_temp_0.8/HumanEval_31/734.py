This code defines a function called `is_prime` that checks whether a given number `n` is prime or not. The function uses some basic heuristic prime testing methods, such as checking divisibility by 2, 3, and 5, and then checking for divisibility by numbers formed by consecutive multiples of 6. The output shows the true for test cases 1 to 7, and false for test case 6, indicating that those numbers are or not prime. The output also correctly identifies the correct response to each test case, which demonstrates that the function is self-contained and effectively solves the problem of determining whether a given number is prime or not.
