```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```
This code defines a function called is_prime that checks whether a given number n is a prime number. The function first checks for numbers less than or equal to 1, as they are not prime. Then, it checks for numbers less than or equal to 3, as they are prime. The function then uses a `iping number` technique to efficiently identify prime numbers. It starts with a `i` and checks if `n` is divisible by any of the multiples of `i` less than or equal to the square root of `n`. The function returns `True` if no divisors are found. If a divisor is found, the function returns `False`.
