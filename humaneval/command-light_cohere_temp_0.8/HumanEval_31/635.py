Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem of checking if a given number is a prime number, and passes the tests provided:
```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```
This function uses a combination of basic primality tests and optimization to efficiently determine whether a given number is prime or not.  It function also passes the assuming tests for primality: 
- The function first handles the base cases of 1 and 2. 
- It then checks for numbers less than 3, which are prime, by checking divisibility only by 2 and 3. 
- It then performs an optimization by testing only values that are less than the square of the input number i, where i is incremented by 6 each iteration. 

This optimization is based on the fact that if n is a prime number, then no prime factor of n larger than the square root of n will appear. 

The function then checks for these potential divisors by testing only values that are less than i + 6, where i is incremented by 6 each iteration. 
This approach is efficient for large numbers, as it avoids unnecessary checks for larger prime factors.
