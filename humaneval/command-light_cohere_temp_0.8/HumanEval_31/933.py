```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```
The provided Python function, `is_prime(n)`, checks whether a given number is prime or not. It uses a specific algorithms to efficiently determine primality, such as checking divisibility by 2 and 3, then using a `while` loop to iterate up to the square root of the number while keeping track of multiples of the number less than its square root.

This function can be used to quickly determine whether a number is prime or not, which is useful in various mathematical and coding applications.
