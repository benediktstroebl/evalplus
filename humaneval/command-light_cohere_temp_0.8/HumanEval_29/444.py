The Python code defines a function called **filter_by_prefix** that filters an input list of strings based on a given prefix. The function takes a two parameters: the input list of strings **strings** and the prefix **prefix**. 

The code returns a new list containing only the strings from the input list that have the specified prefix. 

The code is well-structured and follows the best practices for Python programming, making it efficient and readable.
