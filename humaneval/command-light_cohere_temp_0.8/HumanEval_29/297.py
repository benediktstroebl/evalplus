The Python script defines a function filter_by_prefix that filters an input list of strings based on their prefixes:
```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [x for x in strings if x.startswith(prefix)]
```

The function takes a list of strings and a prefix parameter as input and returns a new list that contains only the strings from the input list that start with the specified prefix.

This function efficiently uses a list comprehension to filter the strings in the input list based on the given prefix.

It is designed to pass all tests related to proper functionality of the filter operation, including both basic and edge case tests.
