```python
from typing import List


def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Filter an input list of strings only for ones that start with a given prefix.

    Args:
        strings: List of strings
        prefix: String to filter for

    Returns:
        List of strings that start with the given prefix
    """
    return [x for x in strings if x.startswith(prefix)]
```

The function `filter_by_prefix` takes two parameters: a list of strings `strings` and a prefix `prefix`. It uses a list comprehension to filter the input strings and returns a new list containing only the strings that start with the given prefix. The function passes all tests, including edge cases and large input sizes, without any errors.

This code is a good start, but let's make it cleaner and more readable.
