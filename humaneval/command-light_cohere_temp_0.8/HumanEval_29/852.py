```python
from typing import List
def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [x for x in strings if x.startswith(prefix)]
```

The code you've shared is a Python script that contains a function called **filter_by_prefix** that filters an input list of strings based on whether each string starts with a given prefix.  It can be used to solve the problem you provided in the prompt.
