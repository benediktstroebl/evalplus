Certainly! Here's a self-contained Python script that defines a function filter_by_prefix and passes all tests without using any external libraries:

```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Filter an input list of strings only for ones that start with a given prefix
    >>> filter_by_prefix([], 'a') == []
    True
    >>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a') == ['abc', 'array']
    True
    >>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'def'], 'a') == []
    False
    """
    return [x for x in strings if x.startswith(prefix)]
```

Please note that this script defines a function `filter_by_prefix` that filters an input list of strings to include only those that start with a specified prefix. This is example below shows how the test cases for the function and the expected outputs.
