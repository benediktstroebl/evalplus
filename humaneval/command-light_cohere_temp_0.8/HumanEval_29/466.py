```python
from typing import List
def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]
```
This Python code defines a function called `filter_by_prefix`, which takes a list of strings and a prefix as input. The function returns a filtered list of strings that start with the given prefix. The code utilizes the String's `startswith` method to achieve this. The `filter_by_prefix` function provides a concise and efficient way to filter elements from a list based on a specific prefix.
