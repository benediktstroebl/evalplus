Here's the provided Python code that includes a self-contained function **`filter_by_prefix`** which solves the problem of filtering strings based on their prefix:

```python
from typing import List
import re


def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Filter an input list of strings only for ones that start with a given prefix.
    >>> filter_by_prefix([], 'a')
    []
    >>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
    ['abc', 'array']
    >>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'x')
    []
    """
    patterns = [re.compile(f'[prefix + "$", string] for string in strings]
    return [string for string in strings if re.search(patterns[0], string)]
```

This code defines a function **`filter_by_prefix`** that takes two arguments: a list of strings and a prefix string. The function creates a list of regular expressions, each starting with the prefix string, and then filters the input list of strings using these regular expressions. The output is a list of strings that start with the given prefix.
