```python
from typing import List


def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]
```
This Python code defines a function named `filter_by_prefix` that takes two parameters: a list of strings (`strings`) and a prefix string (`prefix`). It returns a new list that contains only the elements of `strings` that start with the provided `prefix`. The function uses the `startswith` method to filter the input strings based on whether their starting characters match the given prefix. 

This code is a good implementation of a function that filters strings by prefix, and it passes all the tests with the provided inputs.
