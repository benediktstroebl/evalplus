The provided Python code defines a function called **`filter_by_prefix`** that efficiently filters an input list of strings based on their respective prefixes. 

Here's a breakdown of the code:
- The function **`filter_by_prefix`** takes two parameters:
- **`List[str]`**: This parameter is a list of strings that will be filtered.
- **`prefix: str`**: This parameter is the prefix string that the function will search for in each string.
- Inside the function, it creates an empty list **`[]`** as the return value.
- It uses the function's **`List`** type hint, which means that the input parameter is a list of strings.
- It then iterates through the input list of strings.
- The code checks if the current string starts with the given **`prefix`** using the **`startswith`** method. If it does, it adds this string to the output list.
- The **`startswith`** method checks if the first character of the string matches the given prefix. If the current string does not start with the given prefix, the loop continues to the next string in the list.
- The function returns the output list of strings that start with the given prefix. 

This script is well-contained and self-contained, as it defines a function that efficiently solves the problem and passes all the tests.
