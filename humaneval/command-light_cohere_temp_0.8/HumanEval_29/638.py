```python
from typing import List


def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [x for x in strings if x.startswith(prefix)]


# Test cases for filter_by_prefix
test_case_empty()  # []
test_case_single()
test_case_multiple()
test_case_nested()

# main
``` 
This code defines a Python script with a self-contained function that filters an input list of strings based on their prefix. 

The `filter_by_prefix` function takes a list of strings and a prefix as input and returns a new list containing only the strings from the input list that start with the given prefix. 

The test cases help to validate the functionality of the `filter_by_prefix` function. 
The test cases include:
- An empty list
- A single string
- Multiple strings with the same prefix
- A string with nested prefix

This function is designed to be highly efficient and self-contained, and it can be easily imported and used in other Python scripts or modules.
