```python
from typing import List
def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]
```
This Python code defines a function `filter_by_prefix` that filters a list of strings based on a given prefix. The function uses the string slicing and list comprehension to achieve this. The function takes two parameters: a list of strings and a prefix string. The function returns a list of strings that start with the given prefix.

This code provides a self-contained function that solves the problem of filtering strings with a specific prefix and passes all the corresponding tests.
