```python
from typing import List
def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]
```
This Python code defines a function called **filter_by_prefix** that filters a list of strings based on a given prefix. The function takes two inputs: a list of strings **strings** and a string **prefix**. It creates a new list containing only the strings from the input list that start with the specified prefix. The function uses the string method **startswith** from the built-in **str** module, which checks if the given string starts with the given prefix. 

This self-contained function is designed to solve a specific problem and can be easily integrated into larger programs or scripts.
