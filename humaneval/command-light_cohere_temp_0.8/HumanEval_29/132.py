The provided Python script defines a function `filter_by_prefix`, which filters a list of strings based on their prefix. The function takes two inputs: `prefix` which is the prefix to search for, and `strings` which is the list of strings to filter.

The function utilizes the `typing` module and returns a new list containing only the strings from the input list that start with the specified prefix.

The `filter_by_prefix` function solves the problem of filtering strings based on a given prefix, passing the corresponding tests successfully. 

This is a self-contained solution and does not rely on any external modules or functions.
