```python
from typing import List
def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [string for string in strings if string.startswith(prefix)]
```

This Python function, `filter_by_prefix`, takes a list of strings and a prefix as input and returns a new list of strings that start with that particular prefix. 

This is a self-contained function that does not use any external functions or modules, and passes all tests.
