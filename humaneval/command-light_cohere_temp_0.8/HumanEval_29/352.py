Here's a self-contained Python function that filters an input list of strings based on a given prefix:
```python
from typing import List
def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [string for string in strings if string.startswith(prefix)]
```
This function takes a list of strings and a prefix as input and returns a new list containing only the strings from the input list that start with the given prefix. It utilizes the example usage to test the function. 

Let's break down the code step by step:
1. `from typing import List`: This line imports the `List` type from the `typing` module. This type is to provide type hints and static type checking in your code.
2. `def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]`: This line defines a function named `filter_by_prefix` that takes two arguments - a list of strings `strings` and a string `prefix`. The return type of the function is also `List[str]`. It represents the output that the function will produce.
3. `return [['string for string in strings if string.startswith(prefix)]`: This line uses a list comprehension to filter the input list of strings. The `if` condition checks if the string starts with the given `prefix`. The `startswith` method is used to check if a string starts with the given `prefix`.
4. The final line returns the list containing only the strings that start with the given `prefix`. 
This function efficiently filters out the unwanted strings and provides a clean and concise output. 
Remember to install the `typing` module before running this code, as it is a part of Python's standard library.
