```python
from typing import List
def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [string for string in strings if string.startswith(prefix)]
```
This Python code defines a function `filter_by_prefix` that filters an input list of strings based on a given prefix. The function utilizes the `startswith` method to iterate through each string in the list and returns only those that start with the specified prefix. 

The code then passes the test by calling the function with an empty list and 'a' as the prefix, which should produce an empty list as the output, which is correct.
