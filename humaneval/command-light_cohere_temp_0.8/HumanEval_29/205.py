```  This code defines a function `filter_by_prefix` that takes a list of strings and a prefix as input and returns a new list of strings that start with the given prefix. The test suite uses the to test the `filter_by_prefix` function with several strings and asserts that the function is working as expected. 

Finally, the tests are run and printed. This code is set up a self-contained function with tests, demonstrating that it correctly filters strings by prefix.
