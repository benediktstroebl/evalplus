The code looks good! This Python function, `filter_by_prefix()`, efficiently filters an input list of strings and removes those that do not start with a given prefix.

This is a good implementation that passes all the tests and is quite efficient. 

Here's the code: 
```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [string for string in strings if string.startswith(prefix)]
```

The function uses the `startswith()` method from the string module, which returns `True` if the string starts with the given prefix.
