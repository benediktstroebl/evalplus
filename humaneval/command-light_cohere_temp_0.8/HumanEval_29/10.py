```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]
```

This Python code implements a function called `filter_by_prefix` that filters a list of strings based on whether the given string starts with a specific prefix. The function takes in two parameters: `List[str]` which represents the input strings and `str` which is the prefix to filter for. 

The code uses the Python list comprehension to iterate through the strings in the list and check if each string starts with the given prefix. 

This function is self-contained and does not require any external functions or modules. It is tests to filter a list of strings for those that start with a given prefix, and it can be used to preprocess data before performing further operations.
