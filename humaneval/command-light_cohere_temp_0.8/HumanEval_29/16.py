The script you requested has been implemented. This script includes a filter_by_prefix function, which accepts a list of strings and a prefix as inputs and outputs a new list containing only the strings from the input list that start with the given prefix. 

This function efficiently uses the string slicing and filtering to achieve the desired output. 
This is a self-contained solution to the problem of filtering strings by prefix in Markdown code.
