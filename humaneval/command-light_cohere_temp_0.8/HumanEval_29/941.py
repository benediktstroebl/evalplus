```python
from typing import List
def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [x for x in strings if x.startswith(prefix)]
```
This Python code defines a function called **filter_by_prefix** that filters an input list of strings based on whether each element starts with a specific prefix. It uses the unique list comprehension technique with a generator expression to achieve this. This function is an great way to solve this problem in a concise and efficient manner.
