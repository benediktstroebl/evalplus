```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]

# Unit tests
test_filter_by_prefix = []
test_filter_by_prefix.add("""abc""")
test_filter_by_prefix.add("""cde")
test_filter_by_prefix.add("""array")
test_filter_by_prefix.add("""def")
test_filter_by_prefix.add("a")

test_filter_by_prefix

def main():
    strings = ["abc", "bcd", "cde", "array", "def"]
    prefix = "a"
    result = filter_by_prefix(strings, prefix)
    assert len(result) == 2
    assert result == ["abc", "array"]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The updated code introduces two main features:
1. Test cases: The code now includes a list of test strings, with `add()` methods to add strings and `test_filter_by_prefix` as a collection to verify that the `filter_by_prefix` function is operating correctly.
2. Variable assignment: We can now define and use variables, which can improve code readability and maintainability.

This code is self-contained, and its functionality is completely defined within the `filter_by_prefix` and `main` functions.
