Here's the improved Python script with a self-contained function that filters an input list of strings based on a given prefix, passing all tests:
```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Filter an input list of strings and return those that start with a given prefix.

    :
    function takes a list of strings and a prefix string, and returns a new list with all strings that start with the given prefix.

    >>> filter_by_prefix([], 'a')
    []
    >>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'cd')
    ['cde']
    """
    return [x for x in strings if x.startswith(prefix)]
```
The provided code defines a function `filter_by_prefix` that takes a list of strings and a prefix as input parameters. It uses the filtering with the set method ``.` filter method `set()` to iterate over the input strings and remove those that do not start with the specified prefix. The code is designed to work correctly for this problem and passes all the corresponding tests.
