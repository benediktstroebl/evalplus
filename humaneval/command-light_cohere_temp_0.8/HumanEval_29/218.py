The code defines a function **`filter_by_prefix`** that filters an input list of strings based on a given prefix. It uses the strings that do not start with the given prefix, it returns the list unchanged. The function is then tested against various test cases, which pass successfully.

**Note**: the function was designed to be self-contained and solve the problem. It does not require any additional external code or functions.
