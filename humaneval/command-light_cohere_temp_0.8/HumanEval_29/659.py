```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]
```
This code defines a function called `filter_by_prefix` in a self-contained and reusable way. It takes a filter an list of strings based on whether the string starts with a given `prefix`. It leverages Python's `startswith` function and a generator expression to achieve this. 

This function is a fundamental building block for many text-processing pipelines and can be easily called with different strings and prefixes to filter out the desired strings.
