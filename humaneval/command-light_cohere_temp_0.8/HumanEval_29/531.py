The code defines a function called **`filter_by_prefix`** which takes a list of strings and a prefix as input and returns a new list of strings that start with that given prefix.

This function uses the **`List`** comprehension and the **`startswith`** function to filter the input strings. 
The function is tested on several inputs and the results are displayed in the console.
