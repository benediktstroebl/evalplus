The function `filter_by_prefix` takes a list of strings and a prefix as input. It uses the using the relevant prefix to filter out all the strings from the list that do not start with the prefix.

Here's a small example that demonstrates the usage of the function with a list of strings and a given prefix:
```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [string for string in strings if string.startswith(prefix)]

# Example
my_strings = ['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array', 'hello']
print(filter_by_prefix(my_strings, 'a'))
```

The output will be:
```
['abc', 'array']
```

The function is self-contained and has a clear and concise structure, making it easy to understand and maintain.  It can be easily adapted to solve more complex problems related to string filtering and prefix matching.
