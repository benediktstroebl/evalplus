Certainly! This script defines a function `filter_by_prefix` that takes a list of strings and a prefix as input and returns a new list of strings that start with that prefix.

In this script, the function uses the `typing` module's `List` class to ensure type correctness and creates a docstring using the ` docstrings` module. 
To test the function, a series of test cases are defined, which use the function to filter strings with and without the given prefix.
