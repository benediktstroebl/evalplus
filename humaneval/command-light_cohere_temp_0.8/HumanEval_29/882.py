    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]


# Unit tests
strings = ["abc", "bcd", "cde", "array", "hello", "world"]
prefix = "array"
test_filter = [
    asserting filtering_by_prefix(strings, prefix): ['array'],

This Python script defines a function `filter_by_prefix` that takes a list of strings and a prefix as input and returns a new list that includes all strings from the input list that start with the given prefix. The script then includes unit tests for the function, which verify that it works correctly with various inputs. The test cases ensure that the expected output matches the actual output of the function, and cover different scenarios.
