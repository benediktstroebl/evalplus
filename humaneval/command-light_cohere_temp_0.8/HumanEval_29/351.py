Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that filters an input list of strings based on their prefix:
```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [string for string in strings if string.startswith(prefix)]
```

This script provides a simple and self-contained solution to the problem, which is the filtering of strings based on a given prefix. It uses the typing module to provide type hints and better code organization. The function takes a string list and prefix as input and returns a new list that contains only the strings from the input list that start with the given prefix.
