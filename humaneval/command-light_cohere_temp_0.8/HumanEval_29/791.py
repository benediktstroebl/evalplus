The function `filter_by_prefix()` accepts a list of strings and a prefix as input. It's a filtering based on whether the strings start with the provided prefix.

Here's a breakdown of the function:

- `from typing import List`: Imports the `List` typing module.
- `def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]`: The function is defined to filter a list of strings based on a given prefix.
- `List[str]`: It takes the list of strings as the first argument, and the prefix as the second.
- `prefix: str`: It takes the prefix string as the second argument.
- `return List[str]`: Returns a new list that contains the elements from the input list that start with the provided prefix.

The function utilizes list comprehension and the `startswith()` string method from the `string` module to achieve the filtering.

It checks each string in the list against the provided prefix and returns a new list with elements that match the condition.

In summary, the `filter_by_prefix()` function provides a concise and efficient way to filter a list of strings based on a given prefix.
