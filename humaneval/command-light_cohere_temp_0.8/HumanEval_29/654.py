Certainly! This code offers a helpful function called **`filter_by_prefix`** that efficiently filters an input list of strings based on a provided prefix:

```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Filter an input list of strings only for ones that start with a given prefix."""
    return [string for string in strings if string.startswith(prefix)]
```

This code provides an easy-to-use filtering function that can efficiently handle huge lists of strings and filter them according to a given prefix.
