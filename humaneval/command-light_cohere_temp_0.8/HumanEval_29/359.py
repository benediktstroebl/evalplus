```python
from typing import List
def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [x for x in strings if x.startswith(prefix)]
```
This Python code defines a function named `filter_by_prefix` that filters an input list of strings based on a given prefix. 

It utilizes the `startswith` method along with list comprehension to achieve this operation. The function takes two parameters: a list of strings (`strings`) and a prefix string (`prefix`). It returns a new list containing only the strings from the input list that start with the given prefix. 

Please note that this code utilizes the `typing` module, which is not a standard part of Python but provides enhanced type checking and inference features.
