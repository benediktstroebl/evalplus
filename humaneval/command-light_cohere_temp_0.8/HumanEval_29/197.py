```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [string for string in strings if string.startswith(prefix)]
```
This Python code defines a function `filter_by_prefix` that filters an input list of strings and returns a new list that contains only elements that start with a specified prefix. 

The `typing` module is used to specify the expected types of the function's arguments and return value, which helps improve type safety and makes the function more robust. 

This function takes two parameters: `strings`, which is a list of strings, and `prefix`, which is a string that serves as the prefix to be searched for. The function uses a boolean list comprehension to filter the input list, only keeping elements that start with the specified prefix.
