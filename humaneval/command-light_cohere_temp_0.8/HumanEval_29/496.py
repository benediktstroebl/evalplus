Here's the code:
```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [x for x in strings if x.startswith(prefix)]
```
This Python code defines a function called `filter_by_prefix` that filters an input list of strings, `strings`, and returns a new list that includes only the elements that start with a specified prefix. The function uses the specific typing features from Python's `typing` module to help ensure the function's input parameters are compatible. The function takes two parameters: `List[str]`, which is a list of strings, and `prefix: str` which is a string. The function then iterates through the strings in the list and checks if each one starts with the specified prefix using the `startswith` method.
