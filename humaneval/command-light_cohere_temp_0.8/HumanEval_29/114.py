```python
from typing import List
def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]
```
This Python code defines a function called **filter_by_prefix** that takes a list of strings and a prefix as input. It uses the specific character called `List` to iterate over each string and returns a new list that contains only the strings that start with the given prefix. This code is a practical implementation of a data filter that uses string starting with a given prefix as its condition.
