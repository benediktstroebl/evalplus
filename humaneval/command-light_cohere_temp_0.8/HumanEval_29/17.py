The Python script includes the function `filter_by_prefix`, which takes a list of strings and a prefix as input and returns a new list of strings that match the given prefix. The function utilizes the simple filtering logic to achieve this.

Here's the script:
```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [x for x in strings if x.startswith(prefix)]
```

This script defines a function that efficiently filters a list of strings based on their prefixes. It provides a basic implementation, but you can extend it with additional logic or criteria as needed.
