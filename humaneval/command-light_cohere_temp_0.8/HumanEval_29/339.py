The problem is to filter an input list of strings for those starting with a given prefix. The function `filter_by_prefix` takes a list of strings and a prefix as input and returns a new list with all the strings from the input list that start with the given prefix.

The function uses the `typing` module to ensure type-checking and proper functioning. 
It uses list comprehension to filter the strings in the list based on whether their prefix matches the given prefix.
