The provided Python code demonstrates a function, `filter_by_prefix`, designed to filter an input list of strings based on a given prefix. 

The function takes two parameters: `List[str]`, representing the input strings, and `str`, a prefix string to match.

By utilizing the `re` module, the function creates a regular expression pattern `r"^` `<prefix>`, which matches strings that begin with the provided prefix. 

To efficiently filter the strings with the specified prefix, the function employs the `filter()` method from the `re` module, which returns a list of matching strings.

This script is self-contained, and it effectively solves the problem of filtering strings with a specific prefix.
