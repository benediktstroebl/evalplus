Here's the improved solution:
```python
from typing import List
def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]
```

This code snippet defines a function called **`filter_by_prefix`** that accepts a list of strings and a prefix as input and returns a new list that contains only the strings from the input list that start with the given prefix. 
This is a self-contained solution that efficiently filters the input strings based on the given prefix.
