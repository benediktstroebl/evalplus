```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [x for x in strings if x.startswith(prefix)]
```
This Python code defines a function called `filter_by_prefix`, which takes a list of strings and a prefix as input and returns a new list of strings that start with the given prefix. The function utilizes the` List[str].startswith(prefix)`` to filter the strings based on their prefixes.

The code is well-contained and follows PEP 8 style guidelines. It utilizes `from typing` to provide type hints and is designed to be efficient and readable.
