```python
from typing import List
def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]
```
This Python code defines a function called **filter_by_prefix** that filters a list of strings based on a given prefix. The function utilizes the approach of checking if each element in the input string list starts with the specified prefix, and then returns the resulting list of strings.

The code is well-structured and follows good practices. It uses type hints, such as **List[str]** and **prefix**, which clearly specify the expected types of the function's parameters. The function then returns a expected list of strings with the specified prefix, demonstrating a clear and effective filtering mechanism.

Additionally, the code is concise and easy to read, using straightforward syntax and following naming conventions. The function design is a straightforward and efficient approach to filtering strings based on a prefix, which is a common problem in many scenarios.
