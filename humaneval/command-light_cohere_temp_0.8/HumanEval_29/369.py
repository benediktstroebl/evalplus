```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [x for x in strings if x.startswith(prefix)]
```
This Python code defines a function called `filter_by_prefix` that takes a list of strings and a prefix as input. The function uses the filters the list of strings based on whether each element starts with the given prefix. It uses the string starting method to check if each string starts with the given prefix. The filtered list contains only the elements from the input list that meet this condition. 

It uses the `List` and `str` types from the `typing` module to define its parameters and return value, which helps with type hinting and better code readability.
