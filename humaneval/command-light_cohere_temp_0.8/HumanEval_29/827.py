Certainly! The provided Python script showcases a function named **`filter_by_prefix`** that efficiently filters an input list of strings based on their respective prefixes. 

It takes two parameters - **`List[str]`** representing the input strings and **`str`** representing the desired prefix. The function then employs list comprehension to iterate through the input strings, and a **`len()`** call to determine if each string begins with the provided prefix. 

In summary, this function effectively screens out and returns the strings that commence with the designated prefix.
