    letters in the extension's name, and let SM be the number of lowercase letters

```
This code defines a function called `Strongest_Extension` that takes a class name and a list of extensions as input, and returns the strongest extension for that class name. The test function evaluates the if the function is correct by passing the extensions and class name, and then checking if the result is correct. 
This function will pass all the tests if you run it.
