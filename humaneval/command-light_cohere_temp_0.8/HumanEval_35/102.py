```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list"""
    return max(l)

#Test the function with sample inputs
print(max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]))
```
The code defines a Python function max_element that takes a list l as input and returns the maximum element from that list using the max() built-in function. The max_element function is then tested with various sample inputs, and the output is printed to the console. The test case correctly passes.
