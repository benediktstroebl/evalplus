```python
def max_element(lst):
    return max(lst)

# Test cases pass successfully
print(max_element([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 3
print(max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]))  # Output: 123
```

The function max_element takes a list lst and returns the maximum element in the list using the max() function. This approach efficiently solves the partners' simple case and provides a concise and efficient solution to the problem. The code is self-contained within the function and can be easily reused in other parts of the program.
