```python
def max_element(lst):
    """Return maximum element in the list"""
    return max(lst)

# Test the max_element function with a list of values
assertEqual(max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]), 123)
```
Here, we have created a simple function called max_element that takes a list as input and returns the maximum element from that list. Additionally, we have added some test cases to ensure the correctness of the max_element function.
