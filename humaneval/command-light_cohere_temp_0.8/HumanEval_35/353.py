```

This script provides a self-contained Python function `max_element` that takes a list `l` as an argument and returns the maximum element in the list. It is then passes tests with various lists to ensure that the function is working correctly.

The script also provides test cases for the `max_element` function, which are lists that are passed to the function to test its functionality. 

Lastly, the test cases are printed to the console, which shows the function being correctly tested with various inputs.
