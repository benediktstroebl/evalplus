```python
def max_element(lst):
    return max(lst)

# Test case 1: Using list comprehension
test_cases = [[5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]

# Function call and comparison
assert max_element(test_cases) == 123

# Test case 2: Using built function
test_cases2 = [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]

# Function call and comparison
assert max_element(test_cases2) == 123
``` 
The provided Python script defines a function `max_element` that takes a list as input and returns the maximum element in that list. 

The script then provides two test cases to verify the correctness of the function. The function is called with both test cases, and the results are compared with the expected maximum element (123) from the list. 

This script demonstrates a self-contained approach to solve the problem of finding the maximum element in a given list.
