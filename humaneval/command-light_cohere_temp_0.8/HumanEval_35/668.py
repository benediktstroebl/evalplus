```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list"""
    return max(l)

# Test case 1
assert max_element([1, 2, 3]) == 3

# Test case 2
assert max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]) == 123
```
This Python script defines a function max_element that takes a list l as input and returns the maximum element in the list. The function uses the maximum function to find the maximum element. 

The test case 1 passes the test by asserting that the result of the max_element function with the list [1, 2, 3] is indeed 3, which is the correct maximum element. 
Similarly, the test case 2 also passes the test. 

The code is self-contained and provides a solution to the problem of finding the maximum element in a list.
