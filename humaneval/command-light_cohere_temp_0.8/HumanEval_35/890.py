```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list"""
    return max(l)

# Test the function with various input
print(max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]))  # Output: 123
```

In this code, the max_element() function takes a list l: as input and returns the maximum element in the list using the built-in function max(). The test case is passed to the function and the result is printed to the console. 

This is a simple example of a self-contained Python function that solves a problem and passes all the tests for that problem.
