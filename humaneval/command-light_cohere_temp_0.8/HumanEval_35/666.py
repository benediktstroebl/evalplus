```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list"""
    return max(l)

# Test the function with various list contents
test_max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
```
We have defined a function max_element that takes a list l as an argument and returns the maximum element in the list using the max() function. The function is self-contained and can be easily used to solve the problem and pass the test.
