```python
def max_element(lst):
    return max(lst)

# Test the function
assert max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]) == 123
```
This code defines a function max_element that takes a list lst as input and returns the maximum element from the list using the `max()` built-in function. The function is then tested with a sample list and the result is compared with the expected maximum element (123) using `assert`.  This ensures that the function is correct and meets the specified requirements.
