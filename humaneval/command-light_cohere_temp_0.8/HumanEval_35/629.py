```python
def max_element(lst):
    return max(lst)

# Test the function with some data
print(max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]))  # Output: 123
```
This function, max_element, takes a list as input and returns the maximum element in that list. It uses the maximum() function to find the maximum element in the list. The function is self-contained and does not require any external functions or variables to solve the problem.
