This code defines a function max_element that takes a list as input and returns the maximum element in the list. It also has a test cases to verify the correctness of the function. The test cases include:
1. Test case 1: A list with a single element [5]. The function correctly returns 5 as the maximum element.
2. Test case 2 test: A list with a single element [3]. The function correctly returns 3 as the maximum element.
3. Test case 3: An empty list is created and assigned to empty_list. The function correctly returns None as the maximum element.
4. Test case 4: A list containing two identical elements [2, 2]. The function correctly returns [2, 2] as the maximum element. 
The test cases are passed successfully, and the output shows the success message with a green background color.
