```python
def max_element(lst):
    return max(lst)

# Test the max_element function with a list of various elements
print(max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]))
```
The provided Python script defines a function max_element that aims to return the maximum element from an input list lst. 

To achieve this, the function employs the Python built-in max() function, which takes a list as an argument and returns the maximum value present in that list. 

In the test section, the function is evaluated using a list with diverse elements, and the output is stored in the variable result. 

This script provides a straightforward and efficient way to determine the maximum element in a given list, which is a common operation in many Python programs.
