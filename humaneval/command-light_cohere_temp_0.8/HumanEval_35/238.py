```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list"""
    return max(l)

#Test case 1
print(max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]))
```
We've encapsulated the logic of finding the maximum element within the max_element function, which accepts a list l: As an argument and returns the maximum element from the list. This design ensures that the clear and concise code.

This solution is self-contained, and can be easily reused in other projects without the need for additional variables.
