```python
def max_element(lst):
    """Return maximum element in the list"""
    return max(lst)

# Test the max_element function
assert max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]) == 123
```
The function max_element takes a list as an argument and returns the maximum element in the list using the built-in function max. The test code verifies that the list is correct and passes all the tests.

This code is self-contained and can be used directly, without the need for any additional imports or functions from external libraries.
