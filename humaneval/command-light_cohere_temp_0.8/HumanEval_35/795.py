```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list"""
    return max(l)

# Test the function with a sample list and print the result
print(max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]))
```
This Python code defines a function max_element that aims to find the maximum element in a given list. It uses the simple max() function to accomplish this task and returns the maximum value. The function is then tested with a sample list and the result is printed, which should successfully output the element with the highest value from the provided list.
