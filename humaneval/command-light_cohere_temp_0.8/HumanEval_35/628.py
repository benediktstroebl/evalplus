```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list"""
    return max(l)

# Test the function with various inputs
print(max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]))  # Output: 123
```

This function is self-contained and efficiently calculates the maximum element in the provided list. It utilizes the strategy of utilizing the max() function to find the maximum element, which is the first element that satisfies this condition in the list. You can add more tests cases to test the function with various input lists.
