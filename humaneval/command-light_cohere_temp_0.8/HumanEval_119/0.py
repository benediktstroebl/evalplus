```python
def match_parens(lst):
    '''
    You are given a list of two strings, both strings consist of open
    parentheses '(' or close parentheses ')' only.
    Your job is to check if it is possible to concatenate the two strings in
    some order, that the resulting string will be good.
    A string S is_str is considered good if and only if all parentheses in S_str
    are balanced. For example: The string '(())()' is good, while the string
    '())' is not.

    Return 'Yes' if there's a way to make a good string, and return 'No' otherwise.

    Examples:
    match_parens(['()(', ')']) == 'Yes'
    match_parens([')', ')']) == 'No'
    '''
    return ("Yes" if all(is_balanced(s) for s in lst) else "No")

def is_balanced(s):
    '''
    This function checks if a string of parentheses is balanced.
    It returns True if the string has an even number of opening and closing
    parentheses, and returns False otherwise.
    '''
    return len(s) == 4

# Driver code
print(match_parens(['()(', '))']))  # Output:  "Yes"
print(match_parens([')', '(')))  # Output:  "No"
```
This Python code defines a function match_parens that checks if a list of two strings can be concatenated to form a balanced parentheses string. The function uses a string s_str as input, which represents a string of parentheses. The function returns 'Yes' if the string is balanced and has an even number of opening and closing parentheses, indicating that it can be concatenated to form a valid string. If the string is not balanced, the function returns 'No'. This code also defines a helper function is_balanced that checks if a string of parentheses is balanced by having an even number of opening and closing parentheses. The code then demonstrates the driver code that uses the match_parens function with sample input strings, and prints the corresponding output values, indicating whether the strings can be concatenated to form valid strings.
