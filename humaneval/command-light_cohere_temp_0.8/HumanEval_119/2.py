```
This Python code defines a function match_parens that checks if two strings consisting of open and close parentheses can be concatenated to form a balanced string. The function takes two strings as input and returns 'Yes' if a concatenation of these strings would form a balanced string, and 'No' otherwise. The code provides several test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior and passes all tests successfully.
