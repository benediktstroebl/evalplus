```python
from typing import List

def filter_integers(values):
    return [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]

# Test cases
test_filter_integers = [
    [],
    ['a', 3.14, 5],
    [1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []],
]

results = filter_integers(test_filter_integers)

print("Test results:")
for result in results:
    print(result)
```
The provided code defines a function called filter_integers that takes a list of values and returns a new list containing only the integers from the input. The function uses the filtering logic to identify and include only the integer values in the output. Additionally, it comes with a series of test cases that validate the correctness of the filtering process. The output will display all the results of the function's execution against the test cases.
