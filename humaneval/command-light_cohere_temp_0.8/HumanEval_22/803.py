```python
from typing import List

def filter_integers(values:
    """
    filtered_integers = [num for num in values if num >= 0]
    return filtered_integers
```

The function takes a list of values and returns a new list containing only the integers from the input. It does this by iterating over each element in the input list and checking if it's non-negative. 

This is a self-contained function, meaning it can be used and understood without the need for additional external code.
