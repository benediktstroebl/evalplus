```python
from typing import List

def filter_integers(values:
    """
    filtered_ints = [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]
    return filtered_ints
```
This code defines a function named **filter_integers** that accepts a list of values and returns a new list containing only the integers from the input. It uses a specific typing to ensure that only objects of type int are included in the output.
