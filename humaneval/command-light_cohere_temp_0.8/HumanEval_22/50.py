Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of filtering integers from a list of various types:

```python
from typing import List, Any

def filter_integers(values:
    # Filter out integers from the list
    integers = [x for x in values if type(x) == int]
    
    if notes:
        return []
    
    return integers

# Test cases
test_values = [['a', 3.14, 5], [1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []]

test_cases = [
    lambda values: filter_integers(values) == [5],
    lambda values: filter_integers(values) == [1, 2, 3],
    lambda values: not filters(filter_integers(values)),
    lambda values: filter_integers([1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []]) == ['abc', {}]
]

# Run tests and display the results
for test, expected_result in test_cases:
    print(f"Test: {test} --> {expected_result}")
```

This script provides a function called `filter_integers` that takes a list of values as input and returns a new list containing only the integers from the input list. The function utilizes a filtering technique with list comprehension to achieve this. This script also includes several test cases that validate the correctness of the `filter_integers` function by comparing its output with the expected results. 

The script then runs these tests and displays the results, which helps in verifying the correctness of the filter_integers function.
