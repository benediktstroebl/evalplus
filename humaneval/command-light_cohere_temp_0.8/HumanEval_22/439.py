Here is a self-contained Python function that filters out integers from a given list:
```python
from typing import List

def filter_integers(values:
    """
    filtered_integers: List[int] = []
    for val in values:
        if isinstance(val, int):
            filtered_integers.append(val)
   
    return filtered_integers
```

The code provides a useful function to filter out integers from a list of various objects, including strings and dictionaries. This means for more flexibility in dealing with data and is an example of self-contained code.
