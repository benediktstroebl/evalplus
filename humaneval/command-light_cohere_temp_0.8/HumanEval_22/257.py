Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of filtering integers from a list:

```python
def filter_integers(values: List[Any]):
    return [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]

# Test the function
values_test = [1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, [0, 1, 'two', [3]])
result = filter_integers(values_test)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

This script defines a function `filter_integers` that takes a list of any values as an argument and returns a new list containing only the integers from the input list. The function uses a simple filtering logic to achieve this. 

The test case is passed to the function, and the expected output is `[1, 2, 3]`, which is printed to the console to pass the test.
