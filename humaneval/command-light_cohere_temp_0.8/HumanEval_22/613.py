```python
from typing import List

def filter_integers(values:
    # Filtering integers from a list of any python value
    return [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]

# Test the function with markdown code block passed as argument
values_test = ['a', 3.14, 5]
result = filter_integers(values_test)
print(result)  # Output: [5]

# Test the function with a list of integers and non-integers
values_gross = [1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []]
result_gross = filter_integers(values_gross)
print(result_gross)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```
This Python script defines a function called `filter_integers` that filters integers from a list of any Python value. It then passes this test the top-level test by passing a markdown code block as argument, which should filter out all integers. It also passes another list of integers and non-integers to the function to test its behavior on such inputs. The function's output for both cases is the list of integers.
