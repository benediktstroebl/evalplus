Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of filtering integers from a list of various Python values, passing the test of accepted inputs:
```python
from typing import List
def filter_integers(values:
    return [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    [],  # [] Converted to empty list of Any type
    ['a', 3.14],  # Filtering for non-integer
    [1, 2, 3], ['abc', {}, []],  # Filtering for mixed types
    ]

# Test if function works as expected
for test_case in test_cases:
    actual = filter_integers(test_case)
    assert actual == [x for x in test_case if isinstance(x, int)]
```
The script defines a function `filter_integers` that takes a list of values and returns a new list containing only the integers from the input. The test cases are a input to the function to ensure that it is working correctly for all types of inputs and values.
