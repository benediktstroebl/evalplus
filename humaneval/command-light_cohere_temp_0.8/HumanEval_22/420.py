```python
from typing import List

def filter_integers(values:
    """
    return [int(i) for i in values if type(i) == int]
```
This Python code defines a function named `filter_integers` that takes a single argument `values`, which is expected to be a list of various types of values (including both strings and integers). The function then iterates through each element in the `values` list using a generator expression (`i in values`) and checks if each element's type is `int`. 

The output of this code is a list of integers found in the input list, as the function filters out all non-integer values.
