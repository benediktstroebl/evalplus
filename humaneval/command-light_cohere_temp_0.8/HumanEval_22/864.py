```python
from typing import List

def filter_integers(values: 
    return [int(el) for el in values if type(el) == int]
):
    pass

# Example usage passing test case
values = [1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []]
print(filter_integers(values))  # [1, 2, 3]
``` 
This script defines a function `filter_integers` that filters a list for only the integers from the given list. 

The function uses a list comprehension and checks the type of each element in the list. 

It returns a new list that contains only the integers. 

The function is self-contained, and it does not rely on any other functions or modules outside it. 
This is a standard way of creating self-contained functions in Python, as they are designed to be standalone and can be used anywhere in a program.
