```python
from typing import List

def filter_integers(values:
    """
    filtered_ints = [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]
    return filtered_ints
```

This function takes a list of values as input and returns a new list containing only the integers from the input list, using a list comprehension with the `isinstance` function to filter out any non-integer values. The code is self-contained and does not require any external imports.
