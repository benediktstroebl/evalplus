```python
from typing import List
def filter_integers(values):
    return [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]

# Test the function with various data types
test_values = [['a', 3.14, 5, (1, 2, 3), 'abc', {}, []]
test_results = filter_integers(test_values)

print("Test Results:", test_results)

``` 
This code defines a function called filter_integers that takes a list of values and returns a new list containing only the integers from the input. The function uses the filtering logic to iterate through each element in the input list, and if the element is an integer, it is included in the resulting list.

The function is then tested with a list of values, and the results are printed to the console. This allows you table of the content is printed to verify that the function is working as expected.
