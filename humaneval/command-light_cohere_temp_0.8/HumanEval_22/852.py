```python
from typing import List
def filter_integers(values:
    """ 
    filtered = [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]
    return filtered
``` 
This function takes a list of values and returns a new list containing only the integers from the input list. It uses the universal Python type hint `isinstance(x, int)` to check if each element in the input list is an integer. 
This function is self-contained, which means it can be used to solve the problem without needing external code or functions.
