The provided code defines a function called `rounded_avg` that calculates the average of a range of numbers, rounding the result to the nearest integer. The function takes two positive integers `n` and `m` as input and returns the rounded average as a string in binary. The function also includes test cases that demonstrate its behavior. 

This code provides a self-contained function to solve the problem and passes all corresponding tests.
