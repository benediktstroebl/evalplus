The function `minPath` calculates the minimum path lengths in a grid using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. The function uses two main helper functions:
`dfs` - Calculates the Depth First Search tree for the grid. `minPath_recursive` - `dfs` uses recursion to build the tree and then calls `minPath_recursive` with the appropriate parameters to calculate the minimum path lengths. The `minPath_recursive` function uses the DFS algorithm to calculate the minimum path lengths and uses the `dfs` function to build the tree. The main function then passes the grid and the desired path length `k` as parameters, and returns the minimum path lengths as a list. 
The tests pass the grid and the desired path length `k` as parameters and verify that the returned list of minimum path
