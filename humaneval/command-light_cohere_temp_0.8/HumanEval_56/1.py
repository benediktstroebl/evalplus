``` 
This code defines a function `correct_bracketing` that checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in a given string of brackets. The `hasClosingBracket` function checks if a given character is an opening or closing bracket. The output will be True if the brackets are correctly paired, and False otherwise.
