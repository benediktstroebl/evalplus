 ``` 
This function takes a string of brackets `<`, ">, and returns `True` if it is a valid bracket sequence, meaning that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. 

The function uses a nested loop to iterate through the input brackets and creates a set of closing brackets. If the set of closing brackets does not contain an element for every opening bracket, the function returns `False`.

The function is then tested with different input brackets and the output is printed.
