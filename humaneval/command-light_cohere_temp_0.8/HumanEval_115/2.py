    You are given a rectangular grid of wells and buckets. Your task is to use the buckets to empty the wells.

    grid: List of lists representing a rectangular grid of wells

    capacity: Number of units of water that can be stored in buckets
    Output: Number of times that you need to lower the buckets
    Example 1:
        Input: 
        grid : [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]]

This Python code is a function called max_fill, which aims to maximize the number of filled wells in a grid using buckets. It takes a an approach where a rectangular grid of wells, represented as lists of 0s and 1s, and a number of buckets, represented as the capacity. The function generates all possible combinations of bucket positions to fill, tracks the maximum number of filled wells, and fills the buckets in the most efficient position. The code then calculates the maximum number of filled wells and returns this value as the output.
