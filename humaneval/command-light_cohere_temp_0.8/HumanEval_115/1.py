def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    """
    You are given a rectangular grid of wells,
    and each 1 in a row represents a single unit of water.
    Your task is to use the buckets to empty the wells.
    Input: 
    grid : [[0,0,1,0], ...], a list of lists representing the grid
    capacity : int
    Output: number of times you need to lower buckets
    Example:
        Input: 
        grid : [[0,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], ...], capacity = 10
        Output: 4

    Example:
        Input: 
        grid : [[0,0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]], capacity = 5
        Output: 0
