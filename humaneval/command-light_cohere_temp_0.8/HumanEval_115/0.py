    following is solution:
    The length of the grid is the maximum number of buckets, so you can use depth-first search to find the maximum number of full buckets.

    Initialize the number of buckets that have been filled to 1 and set the max value of the variable to 0.

grid = [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]]
grid[0][1] = 1

# Example 2
grid = [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]]
grid[0][1] = 2
print(max_fill(grid, 3)) # Output: 5

# Example 3
grid = [[0,0,0], [0,0,0]]
print(max_fill(grid, 5)) # Output: 0
```
The function max_fill uses a nested loop to iterate through each cell of the grid. The function fills each bucket with the most amount of water and returns the number of buckets that were filled.
