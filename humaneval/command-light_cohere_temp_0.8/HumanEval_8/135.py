Here's the self-contained Python function that correctly solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List
def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    product = 1
    sum = 0
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        sum += num
    return (sum, product)
```
This code defines a function `sum_product` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the sum and product of all the integers. The function uses a loop to calculate the sum and product of the numbers in the list.
