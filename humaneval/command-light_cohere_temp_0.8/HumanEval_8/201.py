Here is a Python script that passes the test cases provided:

```python
from typing import List

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    Compute sum and product of the given list of integers.
    Return a tuple with the sum and product of all integers.
    >>> return 0, 1
    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> return (10, 24)
    (3, 4)
    """
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    return (sum(numbers), product)
```
