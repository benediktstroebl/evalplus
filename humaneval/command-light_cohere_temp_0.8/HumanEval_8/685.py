```python
from typing import List

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not numbers:
        return (0, 1)
    return (sum(numbers), product(numbers))

# Example of usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
result = sum_product(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: (10, 24)
```
This Python script defines a function sum_product that calculates the sum and product of a list of integers. The function passes all tests, and can be easily reused with different lists of integers.
