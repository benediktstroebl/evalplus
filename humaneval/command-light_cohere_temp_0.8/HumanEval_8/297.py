This Python code presents a function sum_product designed to compute the sum and product of a given list of integers. It employs a type hint feature and utilizes type hints for improved code readability and maintainability. The function follows a signature of taking a list of integers as input and returning a tuple containing the sum and product of the list.

The code also includes unit tests for the sum_product function using the pytest library. The tests cover various scenarios, such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list of integers. These tests ensure the certain behavior of the function as expected.
