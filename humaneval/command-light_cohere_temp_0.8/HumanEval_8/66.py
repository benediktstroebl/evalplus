Here's the code with comments that explains what each line is doing:
```python
from typing import List
def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    This function takes a list of integers and returns a tuple that holds the sum and product of all the numbers in the list.
    >>> # Check if the input is empty
    if not numbers:
        return (0, 1)
    >>> # Check if the list has one element
    elif len(numbers) == 1:
        return (numbers[0], numbers[0]*1)
    >>> # If the list has more than one element
    else:
        return (sum(numbers), product(numbers))
    """

def product(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    This function takes a list of integers and returns the product of all the numbers in the list
    >>> # Check if the input list is empty
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Input list is empty")
    >>> # Raise error if input list is not list
    assert isinstance(numbers, List), "Input should be a list"
    >>> # Compute the product of numbers
    return sum(numbers) * max(numbers)
```

This script defines a function `sum_product` that takes a list of integers and returns a tuple with the sum and product of the numbers in the list. The function first checks if the number of items in the list is either 0 or 1, and returns 0 and 1 respectively. If the list has more than one item, it calculates the sum and product of all the numbers in the list. The function also defines a helper function `product` that checks if the input is empty and raises an error if it is not a list.
