Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the tests:
```python
from typing import List

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    Calculate the sum and product of a given list of integers.
    Args:
        numbers: A list of integers
    Returns: A tuple containing the sum and product of all the integers in the list.
    """
    sum = 0
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        sum += num
        product *= num
    return (sum, product)
```

The function sum_product takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the sum and product of the numbers in the list. It iterates through through a sum of the numbers in the list, and then calculates the product by multiplying all the numbers in the list together.
