Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of calculating the sum and product of a list of integers and passes the tests provided: 
```python
from typing import List
def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    result_sum = sum(numbers)
    result_product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        result_product *= num
    return (result_sum, result_product)
# Testing the function with sample inputs
test_data = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
result = sum_product(test_data)
print("Sum:", result)
print("Product:", result[1])

test_data2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result2 = sum_product(test_data2)
print("Sum:", result2)
print("Product:", result2[1])
``` 
This script defines a function `sum_product` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the sum and product of those integers. The script then passes two sets of test data and prints the results.
