Here is a Python script that defines a function sum_product with tests covering the mentioned problem:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    Calculate the sum and product of all integers in a list.
    Args: numbers (List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]
    Returns: Tuple[sum, product]
    """
    assert not numbers, "Input cannot be empty"
    sum = 0
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        sum += num
        product *= num
    return (sum, product)
```

The code defines a function `sum_product` that calculates the sum and product of a list of integers. It uses the type hints to improve code readability and provide information about the expected input types for the function parameters and return values.

The function also includes input validation to check if the input is empty and raise an appropriate exception if necessary.
