```python
from typing import List

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    product = 1
    sum = 0
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        sum += num
    return (sum, product)

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    [], (0, 1)  # Empty sum should be 0 and empty product should be 1
    [1, 2, 3], (10, 24)  # Sum and product values verified
]

# Test execution
for test_case in test_cases:
    actual_sum, actual_product = sum_product(test_case)
    expected_sum, expected_product = next(test_case)
    assert actual_sum == expected_sum, f"Sum ({actual_sum}) != Expected Sum ({expected_sum})"
    assert actual_product == expected_product, f"Product ({actual_product}) != Expected Product ({expected_product})"
```
The provided code defines a function `sum_product` that calculates the sum and product of a list of integers. The test cases are lists of integers, and the code asserts that the function's output matches the expected sum and product values.

The code provides a complete solution and test suite for the given problem.
