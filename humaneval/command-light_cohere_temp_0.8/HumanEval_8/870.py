```
The provided solution is a function that calculates the sum and product of a list of integers, it first checks if the list is empty and returns 0 and 1, and then uses the built-in function sum() and * operator to calculate the sum and product of the numbers in the list, respectively. The function is self-contained and can be easily imported and called within any Python script.
