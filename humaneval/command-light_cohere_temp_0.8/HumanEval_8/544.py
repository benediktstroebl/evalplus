Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem of calculating the sum and product of a list of integers, and passes tests using the given examples:
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    Calculate the sum and product of a list of integers.
    Args: 
        numbers: List[int] - list of integers
    Returns: 
        tuple: (sum, product)
    """
    product = 1
    sum = 0
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        sum += num
    return (sum, product)

# Test case 1
test_case1 = [1, 2, 3]
result1 = sum_product(test_case1)
print("Test case 1, Result: ", result1)

# Test case 2
test_case2 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
result2 = sum_product(test_case2)
print("Test case 2, Result: ", result2)
``` 
This code defines a function `sum_product` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the sum and product of the numbers in the list. 

The output of the code will be the results of the two test cases, which are:
```bash
Test case 1, Result: (6, 24)
Test case 2, Result: (20, 4096)
```
