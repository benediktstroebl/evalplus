```python
from typing import List
def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """ Calculate the sum and product of a list of integers.
    return a sum as a product of the list.
    if not numbers:
        return 0, 1
    if not list(numbers):
        return 0, 1
    return sum(numbers), products(numbers)
    def products(numbers: List[int])) -> List[int]:
        """ Compute the product of all integers in the list
        return list([num for num in numbers if num != 0])
        """
        return [num for num in numbers if num != 0]
```
