This Python script defines a function `sum_product` that calculates the sum and product of a list of integers. It then provides unit tests to verify the correctness of the function. The test cases include:
1. Empty list returns 0 and 1 (empty sum and product).
2. A list with numbers returns the specific sum and product values.
