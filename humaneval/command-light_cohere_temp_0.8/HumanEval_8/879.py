This script defines a `sum_product` function that calculates the sum and product of a list of integers. It uses type hints to provide better documentation for the function, and its parameters. 

The `test_case_1` test passes because it calls the function with a list of integers and prints the result correctly. The other test cases also pass due to the same logic.
