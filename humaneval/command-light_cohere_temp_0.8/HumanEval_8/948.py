```
This code defines a function called sum_product that takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the sum and product of the numbers in the list. The function uses a optimized algorithm to calculate the sum and product of integers in the list efficiently. 

The above function passes all the test cases for the sum_product function in the provided Markdown code block.
