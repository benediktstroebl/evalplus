```python
from typing import List

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """ Calculate the sum and product of a list of integers.
    if not numbers:  # Empty list
        return (0, 1)
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    return (sum(numbers), product)

# Unit tests
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
test_sum_product(numbers)  # Should return (6, 12)
``` 
This code defines a function `sum_product` that calculates the sum and product of a list of integers, and passes the test by checking the output against the expected result.
