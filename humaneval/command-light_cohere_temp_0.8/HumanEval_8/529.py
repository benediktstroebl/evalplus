```python
from typing import List

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not numbers:  # Remove empty list
        return (0, 1)
    return (sum(numbers), products(numbers))


def products(numbers: List[int]):
    result = 1
    for num in numbers:
        result *= num
    return result
```
The problem is to calculate the sum and product of a given list of integers, and the provided code defines two functions. The sum_product function takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple of two integers: the sum of the list and the product of the list. The products function calculates the product of all the integers in the list. The code is written in a clear and concise manner, using the typing module to provide type hints and improve code readability.
