The above code defines a function called sum_product, which takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the sum and product of all the integers in the list. The function first checks if the number list is empty, and if so, returns (0, 1). If the list is not empty, the function uses the built-in functions sum and product to calculate the sum and product of the list respectively.
