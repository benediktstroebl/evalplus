This code defines a function named `multiply` that takes two integers as input and returns the product of their unit digits. 

The function uses the `str()` function to convert the input integers into strings, then uses list comprehension to extract the unit digits from the string representation of each number. 
Finally, it sums up these unit digits and returns the result. 

This function passes the test cases provided in the comment with the comments and correctly handles different types of input.
