```python
def get_row(lst, x):
    """
    You are given a 2 dimensional data, as a nested lists,
    which is similar to matrix, however, unlike matrices,

This function is straightforward: it takes a list lst and an integer x, and returns a list of tuples, each containing a coordinate - (row, column), starting from index 0. The function sorts the coordinates by rows in ascending order and by columns in descending order. The function also handles the empty lists and provides an empty list as expected output for invalid arguments.
