```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    return sum(c == 7 for c in str(n) if c.isdigit() and int(n) < 9) % 2

def test_fizz_buzz():
    assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0
    assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2
    assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3
```
This code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in the string representation of numbers less than n and divisible by 11 or 13. It then has a test function `test_fizz_buzz` which is used to assert the correctness of the `fizz_buzz` function with the provided test values.
