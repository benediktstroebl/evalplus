This function, `fizz_buzz`, calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in the range of numbers less than a given input `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13. It uses a the Python loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to `n`, and for each number, it checks if the last digit is 7 and, if so, increments the `result` counter. Additionally, it checks if the number is divisible by 11 or 13 and, if so, it also increments the `result` counter.
