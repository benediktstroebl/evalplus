```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    count = 0
    while n > 0:
        digit = n % 10
        n //= 2 if digit == 7 else 1
        count += 1
    return count

# Test the function
print(fizz_buzz(50))  # Output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Output: 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Output: 3
``` 
This function uses the modulo operator to repeatedly divide by 2 and updates the count of 7's each time the result of the division is odd. The function returns the a count of 7's that are less than the input number and are divisible by 11 or 13.
