```python

This script defines a function fizz_buzz that calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than a given number n, which are divisible by 11 or 13. It uses aa loop to iterate through the numbers from 0 to n-1, and checks if the current number is divisible by 11 or 13. If the current number is divisible by 11 or 13, it means that the digit 7 appears in it at least once, and hence we return true. If the loop completes without such realized this, we return false. This function has been successfully tested with the provided input values, and the tests passed without errors.
