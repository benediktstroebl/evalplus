```
This function, `fizz_buzz`, calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers that are less than a given number `n` and that are divisible by 11 or 13. It iterates through numbers from 1 to n and checks each number's last two digits to identify if it's 77, 11, or 13. The function returns the count of such occurrences of 7 and 11 or 13, respectively. Additionally, it passes the tests using the function.
