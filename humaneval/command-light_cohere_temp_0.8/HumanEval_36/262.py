The function `fizz_buzz` calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than a given number `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function iterates through numbers from 1 to `n` and checks for divisibility by 11 or 13, as well as the absence of the digit 7. The function then counts the number of valid numbers and returns the result.

The test suite includes three test cases: `test_fizz_buzz()`, `test_fizz_buzz2()`, and `test_fizz_buzz3()`. charter number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than a given number, which is the same as the requirement in the original prompt. The test suite uses the test functions with the `assert` statement to check if the `fizz_buzz` function produces the correct results for the given inputs.
