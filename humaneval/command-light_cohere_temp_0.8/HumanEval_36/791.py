Here is a self-contained Python script that defines and implements the fizz_buzz function, solving the problem of counting the occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers less than a given input n, which are divisible by 11 or 13:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        num = pow(10, i)
        num = num & 15
        if num == 7:
            count += 1
    return count
``` 
This script defines a function fizz_buzz that calculates the count of the digit 7 in numbers less than a given input n, which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a simple loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to n, and uses bitwise AND to check if the number is divisible by 11 or 13. The final count of the 7 is returned.
