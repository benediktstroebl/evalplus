```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    for num in range(2, n+1):
        if all(c % 11 or c % 13 == 0 for c in str(num)):
            count += 1
    return count

#Test suite
def test_fizz_buzz():
    assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0
    assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2
    assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3
```

The provided code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in the set of integers less than or equal to a given number `n`, which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function iterates through through integers in the given range, and uses the `str()` function to convert each integer to a string, then checks whether all the digits in the string are divisible by 11 or 13. The function then counts the time this digit appears and returns this count. The test suite contains a assertion that the function's output matches the expected behavior for the given input values.
