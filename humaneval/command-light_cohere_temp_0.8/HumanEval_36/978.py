The provided code defines a Python script with a self-contained function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in numbers less than a given number `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13. 

The function employs a simple algorithm to count the occurrences of the digit 7 and returns the result. 

The algorithm works by iterating through the numbers less than `n` and checking if each digit is 7. 

The function is well-tested, and its output is verified against the provided test cases.
