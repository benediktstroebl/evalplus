```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    return 7 - (divisors_of_11_or_13(n) + divisors_of_11_or_13(n - 1))

def divisors_of_11_or_13(n: int):
    return any(i == n or i == n - 1 for i in range(1, n + 1) if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 1) == 0)

def test_fizz_buzz():
    assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0
    assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2
    assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3
```
This code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in a given number n, specifically in the range of integers less than n that are divisible by 11 or 13. The function does this using a formula and another helper function `divisors_of_11_or_13` to calculate the number of divisors of 11 or 13 in n and its predecessor. The `test_fizz_buzz` function contains assertions that check the correctness of the `fizz_buzz` function for various input values.
