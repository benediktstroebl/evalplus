Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function `fizz_buzz`, which returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than a given number `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13:

```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
    >>> fizz_buzz(50)
    0
    >>> fizz_buzz(78)
    2
    >>> fizz_buzz(79)
    3
    """
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if int(str(i)) == 7 and (i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0):
            count += 1
    return count
```

This code achieves the desired functionality of counting occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers divisible by 11 or 13, within the specified range, using a loop and condition checking.
