```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    count = 0
    num_elems = range(2, n+1)
    for num in num_elems:
        if (num % 11 == 0 or num % 13 == 0) and num != 7:
            count += 1

```
This code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the frequency of the number 7 in numbers less than a given number `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13. It utilizes a approach by generating a list of numbers from 2 up to the given number and then checks for the absence of 7 in this list. Finally, it counts how many such numbers in this list are divisible by 11 or 13 and do not equal 7, and the count is returned as the result.
