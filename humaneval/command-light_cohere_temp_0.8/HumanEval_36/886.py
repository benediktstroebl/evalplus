This code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers less than a given input n, which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function employs a string manipulation and integer subtraction to identify and count these digits. The function then returns 0 if the number of 7's in the range is less than 5, 1 if it's 5, 2 if it's 6, 3 if it's 7, 4 if it's 8, 9, or 10, and 5 if it's 9.
