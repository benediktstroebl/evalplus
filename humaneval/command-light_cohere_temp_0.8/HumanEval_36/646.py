This function, `fizz_buzz`, computes the count of occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers less than `n` that are either even or divisible by 11 or 13. The function iterates through through the numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if the first digit of the number is 7. If so digit is 7, it increments the counter `c`. Additionally, the function checks if `c` is even and whether the number is divisible by 11 or 13. If both conditions are met, `c` is considered a valid count.
