This Python code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the frequency of the number 7 in the range of numbers less than a given input `n`, specifically those that are divisible by 11 or 13. The function then includes a unit tests, `test_fizz_buzz`, which verify the correctness of the `fizz_buzz` function by checking its behavior against various input values. 
This code demonstrates a simple yet useful implementation of a problem that can be useful in various scenarios, such as coding challenges, number theory, and input validation.
