```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    # Initialize a count of zero
    count = 0

    # Loop through numbers from 0 to n
    for num in range(0, n+1):
        # If the number is 7
        if num == 7:
            count += 1

        # If the number is divisible by 11 or 13
        if (num % 10 == 0 or num % 13 == 0):
            pass

    return count

# Example usage
>>> fizz_buzz(50)
0
>>> fizz_buzz(78)
2
>>> fizz_buzz(79)
3
```
The function fizz_buzz takes an integer n as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in numbers from 0 to n which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a loop to iterate through numbers from 0 to n, and within each iteration, it checks if the current number is 7, and if it is not, it also checks if the number is divisible by 11 or 13. If both conditions are met, the number is passed, and the function increments the count. The function returns the value of count, which represents the number of times the digit 7 appears in the set of numbers less than n and divisible by 11 or 13.
