Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of counting the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than a given number `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    count = 0
    i = 2
    while n >= i:
        digit = str(n % 10)
        if digit == '7':
            count += 1
        n //= 11 if digit == '0' else 13
    return count

# Test the function with inputs 50, 78, and 79
assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0
assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2
assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3
```

The function uses a while loop to iterate through the numbers less than `n`, and for each number, it checks if the last digit is 7. The function then increments the count if the digit is 7, and divides the number by 11 or 13 to get the next number. The loop continues until the number is less than `n` (when `n` becomes 10).  The function then returns the count of 7s in the numbers less than `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13.
