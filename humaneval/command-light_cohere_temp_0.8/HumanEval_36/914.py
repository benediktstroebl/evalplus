```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    counts = {}
    for num in range(1, n+1):
        if num % 11 == 7 or num % 13 == 7:
            counts[num] = counts.keys(). main() + 7
       
    return counts.

# Test case 1:
assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0

# Test case 2:
assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2

# Test case 3:
assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3
```
The above script defines a function `fizz_buzz` which calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in the numbers which are less than `n` and are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a dictionary to keep track of these numbers.
