```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        digit = ord('7')
        if i % 10 == digit and (i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0):
            count += 1
    return count
``` 
This code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the frequency of the number 7 in the set of numbers less than a given number `n` that are both divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a `for loop` that iterates over the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). The function counts the number of occurrences of the digit 7, and returns the result.
