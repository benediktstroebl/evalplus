The code defines a function called fizz_buzz that takes an integer n as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n that are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a nested loops to count the occurrences of 7 and then returns the number of times 7 appears. The code then provides a test cases to check the functionality of the fizz_buzz function.
