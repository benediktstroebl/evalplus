```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    count = 0
    for num in range(10, n+1, 2):
        if (num % 11 == 0 or num % 13 == 0) and num != 7:
            count += 1
    return count

# Test suite
def test_fizz_buzz():
    assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0
assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2
assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3

# Example usage
test_fizz_buzz()
 ``` 
This code defines the function fizz_buzz, which returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a loop, and the condition to check is if the current number is not 7 and is divisible by 11 or 13. The function then counts the numbers that meet this condition, starting from 10 and incrementing by 2 each time. The test suite contains three tests that pass the function with different input values and verify the expected output. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function and run the tests.
