``` 
This Python script defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the frequency of the number 7 in the set of integers less than a given number. The function uses a loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if the first digit of the number is 7 and if the remainder of the number when divided by 2 or 4 is 0 or 1, respectively. This indicates that the result is divisible by 11 or 13, and the number 7 appears the specified number of times.
