```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    return 7 - sum(c == 7 for c in str(n) if n % 11 == 0 or n % 13 == 0)
```

This code calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers less than n that are either divisible by 11 or 13. It uses the str(n) to convert the integer n into a string and then iterates over each character c in the string. For each character, it checks whether n is divisible by 11 or 13, and if so, checks if c is equal to 7. The purpose of this check is to account for the possibility of the number 7 being in a number's decimal representation, but not in the integer part (i.d., 7). In this way way function with numbers less than 7 in the original range of numbers and returns the result.

I hope this helps you achieve your task!
