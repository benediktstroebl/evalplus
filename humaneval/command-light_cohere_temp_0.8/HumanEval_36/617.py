```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    seen = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        digit = str(i)
        count = digit.count('7')
        if count > 0 and (i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0):
            seen += 1
    return seen

# Test the function

assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2
assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3
```
This Python script defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers below a given input `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a loop to iterate through numbers up to `n`, and for each number, it checks if the number contains the digit 7 and is also divisible by 11 or 13. The function then counts the occurrences and returns the total count. The script then tests the correctness of the `fizz_buzz` function by asserting its output for a few test cases.
