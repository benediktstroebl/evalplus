```
This code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in integers less than a given number n, which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a simple loop to iterate through numbers up to the target n, and counts the number of occurrences of 7 in these numbers that are divisible by 11 or 13. The test section demonstrates the simple usage of the function with a few input values and prints the result.
