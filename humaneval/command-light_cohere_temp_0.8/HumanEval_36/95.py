```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    count = 0
    for num in range(1, n+1):
        if num % 11 == 7 or num % 13 == 7:
            count += 1
    return count

# Test suite
def test_fizz_buzz():
    assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0
    assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2
    assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3
```
The provided Python code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in numbers less than a given input `n` that are both divisible by 11 and 13. The function uses a Python loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to `n`. The test suite includes a function `test_fizz_buzz`, which verifies the correctness of the `fizz_buzz` function by testing its behavior with specific input values.
