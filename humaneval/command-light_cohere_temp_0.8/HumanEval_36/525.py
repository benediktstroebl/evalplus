```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    count_7s = 0
    for num in range(1, n+1):
        if (num % 11 == 7) or (num % 13 == 7):
            count_7s += 1
    return count_7s

# Example usage:
>>> fizz_buzz(50)
0
>>> fizz_buzz(78)
2
>>> fizz_buzz(79)
3
```
This Python function, `fizz_buzz`, is designed to count the number of instances of the digit 7 in numbers that are either divisible by 11 or 13 and less than a given number `n`. It utilizes a `count_7s` variable to keep track of the number of sevens found. The function iterates through through a list of numbers from 1 up to the target number `n` and checks each number to see if it is either divisible by 11 or 13 using the modulo operator. If a number meets either condition, the function increments the `count_7s` count. 
Test cases are provided at the end of the script to verify the correctness of the `fizz_buzz` function.
