```  The `fizz_buzz` function counts the number of times the digit 7 appears in numbers less than `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13. It does so by iterating through the number and its predecessor. The function uses a specific logic to check if the current number is 7, and if so, it returns the number. It then adds up the alternative number and sets it as the number's predecessor if the number isn't 7. The function returns 0 if no 7 is found.
