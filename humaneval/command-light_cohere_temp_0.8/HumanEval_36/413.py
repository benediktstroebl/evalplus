Here's a self-contained Python function that counts the occurrences of the number 7 in integers less than a given input number and returns the result: 
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        num = pow(10, i-1)
        if num % 11 == 7 or num % 13 == 7:
            count += 1
    return count
``` 
This code defines a function fizz_buzz that counts the number of 7s in numbers divisible by 11 or 13, or less than a given input n. The function uses a loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to n (inclusive), and for each number, it checks if the number is divisible by 11 or 13 and also if it is 7. If it is, the function increments the count variable by 1. The function then returns the final count, which represents the number of times the digit 7 appears in such numbers.
