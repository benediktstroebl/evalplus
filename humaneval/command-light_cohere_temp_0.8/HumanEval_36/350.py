```
This code defines a function fizz_buzz that calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers less than n, which are divisible by 11 or 13. It uses aator of a dynamic programming approach to build a dp array, where dp[i] represents the number of 7s up to the ith digit position in a number less than or equal to n. The for loop iterates through the numbers less than n, and at each iteration, it checks if i is divisible by 10 with the result of removing the last digit, and if so, it adds 1 to c. Then, it updates the dp[i] with the current value of c + 1.
