```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    count = 0
    while n > 0:
        digit = n % 10
        n //= 2
        count += digit != 7
    return count

# Test code
test_fizz_buzz = lambda: [fizz_buzz(50), fizz_buzz(78), fizz_buzz(79)]
test_fizz_buzz()
 ```

I hope the above code defines a function `fizz_buzz` which calculates the frequency of the number 7 in the numbers which are less than the given number and are divisible by 11 or 13. The test code at the right hand, provides test cases for this function. 

By running the test_fizz_buzz(), you will check if the function's output matches the expected result for the given inputs.
