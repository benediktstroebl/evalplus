Here's the function that checks if a given number has the digit 7 appearing consecutively times or more among the integers less than the given number which are divisible by 11 or 13:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        num = 0
        while(i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0):
            num += 7
        if num == 7:
            count += 1
    return count
```
This function iterates through numbers from 1 to n, for each number, it checks if any of the digits is 7 and if it is, then adds 1 to the count. Also, it adds one to the count if the number is not divisible by 11 or 13.
