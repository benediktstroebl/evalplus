```python

    for i in range(1, n+1):

```
The provided code defines a Python function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the frequency of the number 7 in the set of integers less than a given number `n` that are both divisible by 11 and 13. The function uses a for each digit at position 1 (as the most significant digit is at the front) and checks if the digit is 7 and if the number is divisible by 11 or 13. The seen count is then incremented. The function returns the time the highest frequency encountered.
