```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    result = 0
    i = 2
    while i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % 14 == 0:
            result += 1
        i += 1
    return result
``` 
This code defines a function fizz_buzz that calculates the frequency of the digit 7 in the range of integers less than a given number n, specifically those that are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a efficient logic to achieve this: it iterates through numbers up to n, checking if n is divisible by the current number i or its multiple 14. If either condition is met, it increments the result variable. The loop continues until it reaches a number greater than n, effectively capturing the count of digits 7 in such numbers.
