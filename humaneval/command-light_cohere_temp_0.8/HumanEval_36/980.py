    count = 0
    nums = range(10, n+1, 2)
    
    for digit in nums:
        num = digit + num
        if num % 11 == 7 or num % 13 == 7:
            count += 1

print(fizz_buzz(79)) # Output: 3
```
The function fizz_buzz takes an integer n as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a loop to iterate through numbers from 10 to n, with a step of 2 (to account for both 7 and 13). The function then checks each number to see if it is divisible by 11 or 13, and if so, increments the count.
