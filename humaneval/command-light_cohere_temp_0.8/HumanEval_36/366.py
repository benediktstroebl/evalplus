Here's the code with the fizz_buzz function:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    count = 0
    while n > 0:
        digit = n % 10
        n //= 2
        count += digit == 7
    return count

# Test suite
test_suite = []

def test_fizz_buzz():
    test_suite.append(fizz_buzz(50), 0)
test_suite.append(fizz_buzz(78), 2)
test_suite.append(fizz_buzz(79), 3)

# Main program execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_suite = unittest.main()
    test_fizz_buzz()
    print(test_suite.fail.fail.strip(test_result__test_suite.
```

This code defines a fizz_buzz function that calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers less than n, which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a while loop and a digit extraction until the input number becomes zero, and adds to the count if the extracted digit is 7. Finally, the function is used in a test suite and the result is printed.
