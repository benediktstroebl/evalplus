```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    return len({i for i in range(1, n+1) if i % 10 == 7 and i % 11 == 0 or i % 10 == 7 and i % 13 == 0})
```
The function uses the modulo operator to iterate through numbers from 1 to n, and counts how many of those numbers are divisible by 11 or 13. It returns the option to remove the numbers divisible by both, and keep the count.

I hope this helps! If you have any other questions, feel free to ask!
