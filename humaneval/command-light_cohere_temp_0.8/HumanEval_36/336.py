This script defines a function fizz_buzz, which calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in the set of integers less than a given number n that are both divisible by 11 and 13. The function uses two lists, divisible_by_11 and divisible_by_13, to store the digits that are both divisible by 11 and 13, respectively. Each digit less than the new number is then compared to the digits in the lists. Finally, the digit 7 appears the number of times the corresponding digit appears in the list. The function then returns the number of times 7 appears in the list of numbers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
