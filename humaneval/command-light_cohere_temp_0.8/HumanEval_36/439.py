```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    total_7 = 0
    for num in range(1, n+1):
        num = str(num)
        divisible_by_11 = any(c for c in str(num) if c == 7)
        divisible_by_13 = any(c for c in str(num) if c == 7)
        if divisible_by_11 or divisible_by_13:
            total_7 += 1
    return total_7
```

This code implements a fizz_buzz function that calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in a number less than n and which are divisible by 11 or 13. It iterates through numbers from 1 to n and extracts the digits of the number. 

Then, it checks if the number of each digit is 7, and if it is, it counts it as one more occurrence of 7.
