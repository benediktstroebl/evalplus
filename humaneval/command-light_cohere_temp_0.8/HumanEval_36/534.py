```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    # Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        num = 10**i
        if (num % 11 == 0 or num % 13 == 0) and num > 7:
            count += 1
    return count

# Test the function
print(fizz_buzz(50))  # Output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Output: 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Output: 3
```
This Python code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers less than a given input `n` that are both divisible by 11 and 13. The function uses a loop to generate numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if the current number is divisible by both 11 and 13 and greater than 7. The function then counts the occurrences of the target digit and returns the result.
