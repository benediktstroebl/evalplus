# Test case:

This function uses a simple loop to iterate through numbers from 1 up to `n`. The loop breaks once it encounters a digit that is not 7. It then counts the count of those numbers and adds the count to the result.

This code is self-contained and will correctly solve the problem. You can add more test cases or
