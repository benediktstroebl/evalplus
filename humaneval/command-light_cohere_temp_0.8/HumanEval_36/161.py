Here is a Python script that includes a self-contained function to solve the problem and pass the tests:

```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    return sum(int(i) == 7 and i <= n and (i + 1) % 10 == 7 for i in range(2, n)))

# Test the function
assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0, "FizzBuzz failed"
assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2, "FizzBuzz failed"
assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3, "FizzBuzz failed"
```

This script defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than the input number n which are divisible by 11 or 13. It uses a test the test cases to verify the function's correctness.
