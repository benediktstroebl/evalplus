The function `fizz_buzz` returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in numbers less than `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13. It uses a single loop to iterate through numbers from 2 to `n`, checks if the digit at position 7 is 7, and if the number is divisible by 11 or 13, then it counts the occurrences of 7. The `test_fizz_buzz` function provides a test suite to check if the function correctly calculates the expected result for a given input `n`.  The `test_fizz_buzz` function takes a test case as input, which represents the target number for which we want to check the function.
