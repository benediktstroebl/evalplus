The code is:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    total = 0
    for num in range(1, n+1):
        count = 0
        for digit in str(num):
            if digit == '7':
                count += 1
        if count == 1 or count > n % 11 == 0 or count % 13 == 0:
            total += 1
    return total
``` 
This function uses a loop to iterate through numbers between 1 and n. It then uses another loop to count the occurrence of the number 7 in the string representation of each number. The function then returns the count of numbers that meet the criteria of being either less than n, divisible by 11 or 13, or both, or being less than n and divisible by 13.
