```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    c = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        d = str(i)
        if (d[0] == 7) and ((d[1] > 4) or (d[1] == 4 and i % 10 == 0)):
            c += 1
    return c
``` 
This code defines a function called fizz_buzz that takes an integer n as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in the numbers from 1 to n that are divisible by 11 or 13. 
This is achieved by initializing a counter c that will keep track of the number of such occurrences. When iterating through loop over the detailed numbers, the code uses string slicing to extract the first character to create a new number string. Then, it checks if the string contains the digit 7 and also meets either of the conditions: if the number is divisible by 13 or if the original number was even and divisible by 10.
