Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of counting the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than a given number which are divisible by 11 or 13:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    return sum(c == 7 for c in range(0, n + 1)) % 10

# Test cases
print(fizz_buzz(50))  # Output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Output: 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Output: 3
```

The function `fizz_buzz` counts the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in integers less than the given number, then it returns the remainder when divided by 10. The test cases demonstrate the
