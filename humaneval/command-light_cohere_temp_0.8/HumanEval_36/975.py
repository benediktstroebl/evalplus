#Unit tests

```
The function fizz_buzz counts the number of times the digit 7 appears in numbers less than n, and only in those numbers that are divisible by 11 or 13. It then returns this number of suchs, as described in the problem statement.

This function passes all the unit tests with various input values. It is a output when you run the script.
