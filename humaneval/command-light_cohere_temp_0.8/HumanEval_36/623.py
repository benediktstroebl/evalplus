```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        digit = str(i)
        if digit == '7':
            count += 1
        if (digit[0] == '1') and (digit[1] == '2') and (i % 11 == 0):
            count += 1
        if (digit[0] == '1') and (digit[1] == '3') and (i % 13 == 0):
            count += 1
    return count

# Unit tests:
def test_fizz_buzz():
    return fizz_buzz(50) == 0

def test_fizz_buzz2():
    return fizz_buzz(78) == 2

def test_fizz_buzz3():
    return fizz_buzz(79) == 3

# Run the tests to verify the function correctness!
test_fizz_buzz.test_fizz_buzz2(). reason='Testing fizz buzz for numbers 78 and 79...'
test_fizz_buzz3.test_fizz_buzz()
```
This code defines a function fizz_buzz that counts the number of times the digit 7, or specific sequences of 1, 2, and 3, appear in numbers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function then implements these logic and returns the count. 

Additionally, there are unit tests for the function. The tests are designed to verify that the function works correctly for different inputs, and they pass if the function's output matches the expected result.
