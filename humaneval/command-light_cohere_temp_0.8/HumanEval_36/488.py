```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    return sum(i for digit in '0123456789' if digit == 7 and i < n and int(i) % 11 == 0 or int(i) % 13 == 0)

# Test suite
def test_fizz_buzz():
    assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0
    assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2
    assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3
```
This code defines a function fizz_buzz that calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers less than n, specifically those that are divisible by 11 or 13. The function utilizes a similar logic for the passed test_fizz_buzz function. The test suite contains unit tests to verify the correctness of the fizz_buzz function.
