This code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in numbers less than a given number `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13. The function iterates through numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if the number is divisible by 11 or 13 using the `any()` function with the `str()` format and the digits that can be divided by 11 or 13. It increments the number of times 7 appears if the number is divisible by 11 or 13.
