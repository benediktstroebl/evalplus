```python

    dp = [0] * (4 * n + 1)
    for num in range(10 ** n):
        if (num % 11 == 7) or (num % 13 == 7):
            dp[num] = dp[num // 11] + dp[num // 13] + 1
    return dp[0]

```
This code defines the fizz_buzz function, which calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in the integers less than n that are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses dynamic programming to build a 2D number array `dp` and populate it using conditional assignments. The number of appearances is then counted in the `dp` array. The test cases verify the test functions for different input values and ensure the correctness of the fizz_buzz function.
