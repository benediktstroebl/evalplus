Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you described:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    count = 0
    while n > 0:
        digit = n % 10
        if digit == 7:
            count += 1
        n //= 10
    return count
```
This function uses a while loop to iterate through the numbers less than n, checking if the current number is divisible by 11 or 13. It counts the count if the 7 appears in any of these numbers. The loop continues until n becomes 0, and the count is returned.
