Here's the solution:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize a counter
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through integers less than n
    for num in range(1, n+1):
        # Calculate the digit at position 7 in the decimal representation
        temp = str(num)[0][7]
        
        # Check if the digit is 7 and if it's divisible by 11 or 13
        if temp == '7' and num % 11 == 0 or num % 13 == 0:
            count += 1
    
    return count

# Test the function
# Test cases
print(fizz_buzz(50))  # Output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Output: 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Output: 3)
```

This code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers divisible by 11 or 13, less than a given integer `n`. The function uses a simple loop to iterate through numbers and counts the number of valid digits. You can test the all known test cases to ensure the correctness of the function.

Note: You can uncomment the test cases to run the function and see the expected outputs.
