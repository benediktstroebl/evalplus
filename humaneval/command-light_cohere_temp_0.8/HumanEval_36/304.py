Here's the code to solve the problem of counting the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than a given number which are divisible by 11 or 13:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        digit = str(i)[-][-2:]
        if digit == '7':
            count += 1
        # check for other numbers that are divisible by 11 or 13
        num_is_divisible = int(digit[0]) != 7 and (digit[1] >= '0' and digit[1] <= '4')
        if num_is_divisible:
            for j in range(i, n+1, 1):
                if str(j)[-][-2:] == digit:
                    num_is_divisible = False
                    break
    return count
```
The function loops through integers from 1 to n, and for each number, it checks if it's divisible by 11 or 13 by evaluating the first two digits of the number, and then checks if the remaining number is 7. The function also counts if the the number of times the digit 7 appears in the range of integers less than n that are divisible by 11 or 13.
