Here's the improved code:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        if (11 ** i) % 13 == 0 or (11 ** i) % 13 == 7:
            count += 1
    return count
```
The function fizz_buzz takes an integer n as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in the sequence of numbers 1 to n, which are multiples of 11 or 13. The function uses a loop to iterate from 2 to n, checking if the given number is divisible by 13 or has the digit 7. The count of these digits in the sequence is then returned as the result.
