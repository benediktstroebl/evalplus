Here's the code:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    return sum(x == 7 for x in str(n) if x <= n and n % 11 == 0 or n % 13 == 0)
```

This function uses list comprehension and str(n) to create a list of digits in the given number. It then iterates over this using x == 7 to check if the digit at index x in the number is 7.

This function can be used to solve the problem and pass tests.
