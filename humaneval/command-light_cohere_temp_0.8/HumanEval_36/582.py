This Python script defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in the set of integers less than a given number `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13. It then includes three test functions (`test_fizz_buzz`, `test_fizz_buzz2`, and `test_fizz_buzz3`) to verify the function's behavior for different input values. 

Finally, the script runs the unit tests using the `unittest` module to ensure the correctness of the `fizz_buzz` function.
