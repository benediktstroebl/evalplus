```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    seen = set()
    for num in range(1, n+1):
        if num % 11 == 0 or num % 13 == 0:
            seen.add(num)
    if 7 in seen:
            return num
        seen.add(num)
    return 0
```
The function, `fizz_buzz`, takes an integer `n` as input and returns an integer. It iterates through numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if the number is divisible by 11 or 13. If the number is divisible by 11 or 13 and 7 appears in the set of numbers previously seen, it returns the number; otherwise, it adds the number to the set and returns 0. The function ensures that it only considers numbers divisible by 11 or 13 and does not repeat any number more than once seen.
