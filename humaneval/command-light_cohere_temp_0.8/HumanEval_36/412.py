```  The provided Python code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers less than a given number `n` and returns the result. The function uses a loop to check divisibility with 11 or 13 for each number from 1 to `n`, and increments a count if the remainder is 0. The test suite contains tests that verify the correctness of the `fizz_buzz` function by passing the function with different input values and asserting the expected output.
