``` 
This code defines a function called **fizz_buzz** that takes an integer n as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in the set of integers less than n that are divisible by 11 or 13. 

The function uses a while loop to iterate through the integers less than n and counts the number of times the digit 7 appears in the divisible numbers. 

The function passes the tests with the provided test cases as well.
