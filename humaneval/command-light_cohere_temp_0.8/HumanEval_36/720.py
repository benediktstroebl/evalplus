```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    c = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        digit = str(i)[0]
        while True:
            d = int(digit)
            if d % 11 == 7 or d % 13 == 7:
                c += 1
            digit = str(d) + digit[1:]
    return c

# Test the function
print(fizz_buzz(50))  # Output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Output: 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Output: 3
