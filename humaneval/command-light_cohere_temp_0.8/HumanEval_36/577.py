```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    # A function to count the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        digit = str(i)
        count += (7 in digit) and (i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0)
    return count

# Unit tests
assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0
assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2
assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3
assert fizz_buzz(30) == 3
assert fizz_buzz(73) == 3
```

This script defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive), specifically looking for numbers that are either divisible by 11 or 13. The function then goes through the `count` is set to 0. The function then loops through integers from 1 to `n`, and for each number, it checks if the digit 7 is present in the number's string representation (`str(i)`), and also checks if the number is divisible by 11 or 13 (`i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0`). If both conditions are met, `count` is incremented. The function then returns the final value of `count`.

The unit tests in the provided code are designed to verify the correctness of the `fizz_buzz` function. The tests input various values and verify that the function's behavior aligns with the problem's requirements.
