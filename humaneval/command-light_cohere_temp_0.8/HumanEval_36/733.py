```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    return sum(1 for digit in range(1, n) if digit == 7 or any(i % 11 == 0 for i in range(1, n))) % 2 == 0
```
This function counts the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n, then checks if the number of such digits is even or not. It returns 0 for even the how many times the digit 7 appears in such numbers, 1 otherwise.

This code is self-contained, and it does not rely on any other functions or modules. It can be used as a foundation for solving similar problems.
