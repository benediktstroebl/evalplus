```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        digit = str(i)
        if digit[0] == 7 and int(digit[1:]) % 11 == 0 or int(digit[1:]) % 13 == 0:
            count += 1
    return count

def test_fizz_buzz():
    assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0
    assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2
    assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3
```
This code defines a function `fizz_buzz` which calculates the frequency of the digit 7 in the range of integers less than `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13. The function iterates through numbers in this range and checks if the first digit is 7 and the remainder when divided by 11 or 13 is 0, and if so, increments the count.

Finally, the code includes unit tests for the `fizz_buzz` function using the `pytest` library.
