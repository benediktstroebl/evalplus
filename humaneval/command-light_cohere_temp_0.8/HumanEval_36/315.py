```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    return sum(x == 7 for x in range(1, n + 1) if x % 11 == 0 or x % 13 == 0)
```
This Python code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in integers less than a given number `n` and divisible by 11 or 13. The function iterates through the time series of numbers from 1 to `n`, checking whether each number is 7 (modulo 11) or 7 (modulo 13). The function then returns the total count of these occurrences.
