```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    return sum(c for c in str(n) if c == 7 and int(n) % 11 == 0 or int(n) % 13 == 0)

# Unit tests
def test_fizz_buzz():
    assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0
    assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2
    assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_fizz_buzz()
```
This code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the frequency of the number 7 in numbers below a given threshold. The function uses list comprehension to filter out numbers with a 7 digit and checks if the number is divisible by 11 or 13 using the `%` operator.

The code also includes unit tests for the `fizz_buzz` function using the `test` module in Python. This ensures the code has the test suite and validates the correctness of the function's behavior. 
Finally, the `__main__` block runs the test suite when the script is executed.
