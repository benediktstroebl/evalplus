Here's the code that you asked about:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    return sum([x == 7 for x in range(1, n) if x % 11 == 0 or x % 13 == 0])
```

This script defines a function that calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function utilizes a iterative approach with a generator expression to accumulate the count of such digits.
