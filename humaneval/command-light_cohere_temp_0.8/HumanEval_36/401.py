    count = 0
    for num in range(10, n+1, 2):
        if (num % 11 == 7) or (num % 13 == 7):

```
The above code defines a fizz_buzz function that counts the number of 7s in the set of digits less than n which are both divisible by 11 and 13. This function is optimized by avoiding redundant iterations over the range of numbers up to n, and instead only iterates up to the first missing digit (i. The function then returns the result for the number of 7s found.
