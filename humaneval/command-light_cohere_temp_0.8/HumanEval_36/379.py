```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:    
    num_seven = 0
    for num in range(1, n+1):
        count = 0
        for i in range(10):
            if num % i == 0 and i <= int(n / i):
                count += 1
        if count == 7:
            num_seven = 1
            break
    return num_seven

# Test code
print(fizz_buzz(50))  # Output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Output: 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Output: 3
