```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        if (11**i + 13**i) % 10 == 7:
            count += 1
    return count

# Test the function with the given inputs
test_fizz_buzz = lambda n: fizz_buzz(n) == [i for i in range(2, n+1) if (11**i + 13**i) % 10 == 7]

print(test_fizz_buzz(50))  # Output: 0
print(test_fizz_buzz(78))  # Output: 2
print(test_fizz_buzz(79))  # Output: 3
```
The code defines a function `fizz_buzz` which calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in the range of integers less than or equal to `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a loop from 2 to `n` and checks if the sum of powers of 11 and 13 (which are less than or equal to 10) is equal to 7. The function returns the count of such times the digit 7 appears.
