The provided code is:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        num = str(i)
        num = num.replace(str.swap(True) for digit in '77')
        if num.isdigit():
            if int(num) % 11 == 0 or int(num) % 13 == 0:
                count += 1
    return count
``` 
This function `fizz_buzz` calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in integers less than `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13. The function iterates through numbers from 1 to `n` using a loop. It converts each number into a string, removes the last digit using the `remove()` method with `str.isdigit()` check, and checks if the resulting number is either 11 or 13. If so, it's a valid number, the digit 7 appears in that number, and the count is incremented. The function returns the count after iterating through all numbers.
