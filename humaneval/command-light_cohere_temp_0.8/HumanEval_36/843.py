Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem of counting the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than a given number `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    counts = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        digit = ord('7')
        is_valid_divisor = (i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0)
        if is_valid_divisor:
            count = sum(1 for num in range(1, i+1) if (i % num == 0 and num != 7))
            counts += count
        if i == 1:
            break
    return counts
```
This function uses a loop to iterate through numbers less than `n`, and counts the number of times the digit 7 appears in the numbers.  It computes the a total count of all such numbers and returns the result.
