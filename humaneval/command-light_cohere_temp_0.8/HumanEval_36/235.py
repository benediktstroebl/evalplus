``` 
This code defines a function fizz_buzz that calculates the frequency of the number 7 in the set of integers less than a given number n, specifically those which are both less than 10 and divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a iterative approach with a counter to track the number of occurrences of 7, then returns the total count. The test cases at the verifying that the function produces the expected output for the provided test values.
