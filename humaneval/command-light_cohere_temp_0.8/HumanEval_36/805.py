```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    cnt_div11, cnt_div13 = 0, 0
    for digit in str(n):
        if digit == '7':
            cnt_div11 += 1
        elif digit == '0' or digit == '1' or digit == '9':
            cnt_div13 += 1
    return cnt_div11 + cnt_div13

# Test the function
assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0
assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2
assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3
```
This code defines a function fizz_buzz, which calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in integers less than n that are divisible by 11 or 13. It uses a new variables, cnt_div11 and cnt_div13, to keep track of the appearances of 0, 1, and 9, as well as 7, in the number. Then, it returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers that are less than n and divisible by 11 or 13.
