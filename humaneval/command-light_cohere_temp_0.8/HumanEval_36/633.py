```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if (i % 11 == 7) or (i % 13 == 7):
            count += 1
    return count

# Test the function
print(fizz_buzz(50))  # Output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Output: 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Output: 3
```

In this code, we have a function fizz_buzz that calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in the range of integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to n and checks if the current number is divisible by 11 or 13 and also if the digit 7 appears. The loop increments the count if it meets these conditions. Finally, the function returns the count, which represents the number of times the digit 7 appears in the range of integers divisible by 11 or 13 and less than n.
