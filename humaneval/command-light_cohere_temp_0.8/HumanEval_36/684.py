This code defines the fizz_buzz function, which counts the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than a given number n that are divisible by 11 or 13. It uses a numbers less than n that are divisible by 11 or 13 and checks if the count of occurrences of 7 is equal to 7, it returns true, otherwise it returns false.
