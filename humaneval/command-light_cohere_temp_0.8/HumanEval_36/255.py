This code defines a function, fizz_buzz, that calculates the frequency of the number 7 in the set of integers less than a given number, which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a loop to iterate through the numbers until the input number becomes 0 or a one-day multiple of 11 or 13. The function then counts the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in the input number and returns the total count. The unit tests section provides a series of assertions that verify the correctness of the fizz_buzz function for different input values.
