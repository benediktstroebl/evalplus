```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    count = 0
    for num in range(10, n + 1):
        if (num % 11 == 7) or (num % 13 == 7):
            count += 1
    return count

# Test the function
for i in range(50):
    assert fizz_buzz(i) == 0
for i in range(78):
    assert fizz_buzz(i) == 2
for i in range(79):
    assert fizz_buzz(i) == 3
```
This code defines a function fizz_buzz that calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers less than a given number n, which are divisible by 11 or 13. It achieves this by iterating through numbers ranging from 0 to n - 1, and checking if the current number is either odd (and hence divisible by 13) or 7, or even (and hence divisible by 11). The calculated counts are returned as the function's return value.
