```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    count = 0
    for num in range(1, n+1):
        if (num % 11 == 0 or num % 13 == 0) and (num > 7):
            count += 1
    return count

# Example usage
print(fizz_buzz(50))  # Output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Output: 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Output: 3
``` 
This code defines a function called fizz_buzz that takes an integer n as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in the sequence of integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a loop and a conditional statement to achieve this. The function is then tested with sample inputs and the output is displayed.
