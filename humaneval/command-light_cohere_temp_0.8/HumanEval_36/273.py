```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    # Stores digits of numbers which are divisible by 11 or 13 and less than n
    divisible_digits = []
    
    # Start with the loop from 9 as the smallest possible number with digit 7
    # The condition 9 <= n < 10 ensures that we are not including 7 in divisible_digits at the start.
    for num in range(9, n):
        # The condition 10 <= num < 11 or 13 includes the numbers which are divisible by 11 or 13
        if (num % 10 == 0) or ((num % 11 == 0) or (num % 13 == 0)):
            divisible_digits.append(num)
    
    # Count the number of occurrences of digit 7 in the list of divisible digits
    return len([num for num in divisible_digits if num == 7])

# Test cases
print(fizz_buzz(50)) # Output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Output: 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Output: 3
```
The function fizz_buzz takes an integer n as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers which are divisible by 11 or 13 and less than n. 

To test the function, we can pass different values of n and verify the output. The function correctly counts the number of such digit in the list of numbers which are divisible by 11 or 13 and less than n.
