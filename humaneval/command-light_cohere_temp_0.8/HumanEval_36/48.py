This code defines a function fizz_buzz that calculates the frequency of the number 7 in the set of integers less than a given number n, which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function iterates through values from 1 to n, and for each value, it calculates the count of digits less than 7 in the string representation of that number. It uses a - modulus operator to convert the string into an integer, and then increments a counter for digits less than 7. After iterating over the blindingly large values, the count should eventually hit 2. At this point, it's safe to stop the loop, since any value of i that's greater than 2 would result in 7 being appended to the string, and this would increase the counter beyond 2, which is not allowed. This is a end condition prevents this loop from running indefinitely.
