```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    c = 0
    while n > 0:
        digit = n % 10
        if digit == 7:
            c += 1
        n //= 10
    return c
# Test the function with a few numbers
print(fizz_buzz(50))  # Output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Output: 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Output: 3
```
The code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the frequency of the digit 7 in the numbers less than a given input `n`. It uses a `while` loop to update the counter each time the digit 7 appears in the number less than `n` and divides `n` by 10 to move to the next number. The loop continues until `n` becomes 0, and at this point, the counter is returned.
