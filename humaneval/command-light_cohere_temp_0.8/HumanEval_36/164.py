```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    # Initialize count of divisible numbers less than n
    count = 0

    # Loop through integers less than n
    for num in range(10, n + 1, 2):
        if (num % 11 == 0 or num % 13 == 0):
            count += 1

    return count

# Example usage
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
result = fizz_buzz(n)
print(f" Number of times 7 appears: {result}")

# Test case: 50
if fizz_buzz(50) == 0:
    print("Pass")

# Test case: 78
if fizz_buzz(78) == 2:
    print("Pass")

# Test case: 79
if fizz_buzz(79) == 3:
    print("Pass")
``` 
This code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in the set of integers less than a given number `n`, which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function iterates through numbers from 10 up to `n` (exclusive) in pairs, and counts the number of times the digit 7 appears in this range. If any number in this set satisfies this above conditions, the function will return 0. If any other number is not a valid 7 (or neither 11 nor 13), the function will return the number of those divisors less than `n`. 

This script is well-contained and can be used to solve the problem of counting the times the digit 7 appears in a set of integers that are divisible by 11 or 13.
