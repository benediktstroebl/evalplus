```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    7 % 11 == 0 or 7 % 13 == 0
    return len([i for i in range(1, n+1) if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0])
```
The function uses the modulo operator to check if the number is divisible by 11 or 13, then it returns the count of the digit 7 in that number, which is the number of times the digit 7 appears in the integers less than n. 
Please note that the solution is self-contained and can be run independently without requiring any external functions or variables.
