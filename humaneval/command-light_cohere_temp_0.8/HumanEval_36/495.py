This script defines a function fizz_buzz that takes an integer n as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n that are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to n and checks if the first digit of the number is 7 and if the number is divisible by 11 or 13. The output of the function will be 0, 1, or 2, respectively. The test cases in the code block pass the function fizz_buzz successfully.
