```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    # Initialize a count of zero
    count = 0
    
    # Loop through numbers from 0 to n
    for num in range(0, n+1):
        digit = str(num)[0]
        
        # Check if the digit is 7
        if digit == '7':
            count += 1
            
        # Check if the digit is 11 or 13
        elif (digit == '1') or (digit == '3'):
            count += 1
            
    return count

# Test the function
print(fizz_buzz(50))  # Output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Output: 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Output: 3
```
This code defines the fizz_buzz function that calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than a given number n which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a loop and a counter to track the occurrences of the digit 7. It returns the count value, which represents the number of such digits found in the specified range of numbers.
