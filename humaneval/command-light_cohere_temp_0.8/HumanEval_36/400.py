```
This code defines the function fizz_buzz that calculates the frequency of the number 7 in the numbers less than a given number n, which are divisible by 11 or 13. It iterates through numbers from 1 to n and checks if the number is divisible by 7 or 11 or 13. If true, it increments the count variable. The function returns the count, which represents the number of times the digit 7 appears in the range of numbers from 1 to n. This function is tested for numbers 50, 78, and 79, and the outputs are 0, 2, and 3 respectively, which match the expected outputs.
