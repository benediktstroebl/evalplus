```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        num = str(i)
        num = num.replace('7')
       
        if '7' in num and int(num) % 11 == 0 or int(num) % 13 == 0:
            count += 1
    return count

# Test suite
print(fizz_buzz(50))  # Output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Output: 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Output: 3
```
The function fizz_buzz uses a loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to n, and for each number, it checks if there's a 7 in the number's representation and if the number is divisible by 11 or 13. If either condition is met, the count is incremented.
