# Call the test suite after defining the function
test_fizz_buzz()
 ``` 
This Python script defines a function called fizz_buzz that calculates and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in the range of integers less than a given input n, which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function also comes with a test suite that passes all corresponding tests for different input values. 
The test suite is executed after defining the function.
