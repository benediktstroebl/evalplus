This script defines a function fizz_buzz that takes an integer n as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a loop to iterate through numbers less than n, and counts the number of occurrences of 7 and 11/13. The test cases at the time demonstrate that the function is working correctly and returning the expected results.
