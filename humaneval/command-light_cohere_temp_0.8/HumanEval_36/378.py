```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    count = 0
    for num in range(10, n + 1):
        if is_divisible_by_11_or_13(num) and num != 7:
            count += 1
    return count

def is_divisible_by_11_or_13(num:
    return num % 11 == 0 or num % 13 == 0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("FizzBuzz response:", fizz_buzz(78))
```
This code defines a function fizz_buzz, which aims to find the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers less than n that are divisible by 11 or 13. 

The count variable keeps track of the number of such digits seen. It then returns the by iterating through numbers starting from 0 to the number n.

The is_divisible_by_11_or_13 function is used to check if a given number is divisible by 11 or 13.  The function returns True if the number is divisible by 11 or 13, and False otherwise.
