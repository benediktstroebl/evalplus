```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    sum_of_7s = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        num = pow(10, i, n)
        num = int(num, 2)
        if num % 11 == 7 or num % 13 == 7:
            sum_of_7s += 1
    return sum_of_7s
```
This function uses a loop to iterate through numbers less than the input n, calculating the sum of 7s in the last digits of those numbers. The function then counts the numbers that are divisible by 11 or 13, and have a 7 in their last digit, adding 1 to the sum_of_7s.
