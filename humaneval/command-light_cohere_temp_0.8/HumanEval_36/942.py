```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    return sum(int(d) == 7 and (n % 11 == 0 or n % 13 == 0))

# Run unit tests
assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0
assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2
assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3
```
This script defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in numbers that are less than `n` and divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses the process to sum up the count of such numbers and returns the result.

The function is then tested with various input values, and the results are validated against the expected output.
