            num7 += 1
        if num % 11 == 0 or num % 13 == 0:
            continue

The function fizz_buzz counts the number of times the digit 7 appears in the integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function works by iterating through numbers from 1 to n, and for each number, it checks if the first digit is 7. If it is, then the number is passed and 7 has appeared once, and the function returns 1. Otherwise, the number is not divisible by 11 or 13, so the digit 7 has not appeared, and the function returns 0.
