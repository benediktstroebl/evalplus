```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if int(str(i)) % 10 == 7:
            count += 1
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            break
    return count

# Test cases
print(fizz_buzz(50))  # Output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Output: 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Output: 3
```
This Python function fizz_buzz takes an integer n as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to n. The function then checks if the current number's digit at position 10 is 7. If it is, the digit is 7 and the number is divisible by 11 or 13, the count is incremented. The function also breaks out of the loop when the number becomes divisible by 11 or 13.
