Here's the self-contained function:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    result = 0
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        digit = str(i)
        count = 0
        for d in digit:
            if d == "7":
                count += 1
        result += count % 2
    return result
``` 
This code defines a function called `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers less than `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13. The function iterates from integer from 2 to n and for each digit, it counts how many times the digit 7 appears in the number. The result is the number of times 7 appears, divided by 2, and returned as the result.
