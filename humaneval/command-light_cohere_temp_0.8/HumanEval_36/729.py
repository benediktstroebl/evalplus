```python

    if n < 7: return 0
    count = 0
    while n % 11 == 0 or n % 13 == 0:
        n /= 13
        count += 1

``` 
The function fizz_buzz calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers less than n that these numbers are divisible by 11 or 13. It uses a first initializes a count variable to zero, then it enters a loop and repeatedly divides n by 13 until it becomes a multiple of 11 or 13. At each division, the count variable is incremented by one, representing the number of times 7 appeared before the division. The function then returns the value of count - 0 if n is less than 7, indicating no digit 7 occurred in numbers less than 7, and otherwise returns the count of appearances of 7 in numbers less than n that are divisible by 11 or 13. 
This function is self-contained, with no external dependencies and can be easily tested and debugged.
