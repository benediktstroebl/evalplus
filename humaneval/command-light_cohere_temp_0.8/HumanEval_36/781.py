```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):

    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        digit = ord('7') + (i - 1)
        if all(c for c in str(i) if c == digit):
            count += 1

```
This code defines a function fizz_buzz that calculates the frequency of the digit 7 in numbers below a given number n. It employs a particular loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to n. The digit at position (position) 7 is added to the number i, and the existence of this digit in the string representation of i is checked using the all function. This loop continues until a string contains only the digit 7, at which point the loop starts to increment the count of appearances of this digit. 

The function then returns the count of the number of times the digit 7 appears in the range of numbers less than n.
