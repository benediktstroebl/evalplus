``` 
This code defines a function fizz_buzz that calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in the sequence of integers less than n, which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a optimization to skip multiples of 10 and only counts when the digit 7 is present. The test_fizz_buzz function is then used to test the function, and the results are printed to the console.
