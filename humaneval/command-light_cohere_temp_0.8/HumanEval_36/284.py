Here's the self-contained Python function that solves the problem:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    count = 0
    i = 4  # Start from 4 because 4,7 are 7-divisible
    while n >= i:
        if n % 7 == 0 or n % 11 == 0 or n % 13 == 0:
            count += 1
        n //= 13  # Added division by 13 to handle potential overflow during i//11 loop
    return count

# Example usage:
>>> fizz_buzz(50)
0
>>> fizz_buzz(78)
2
>>> fizz_buzz(79)
3
```

This function starts by counting the number of 7's in the numbers from 4 up to n. It then divides n by 13 to ensure that the loop doesn't cause integer overflow. The function returns the value of count, which is the number of times 7 appeared in the provided range of numbers.
