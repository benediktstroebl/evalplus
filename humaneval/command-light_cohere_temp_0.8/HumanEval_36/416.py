```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    c = 0
    while n > 0:
        if n % 11 == 7 or n % 13 == 7:
            c += 1
        n //= 13
    return c

# Test the function
for i in range(80):
    if fizz_buzz(i) == 0:
        print(f"Failed at index {i}")
    else:
        print(f"Passed at index {i}")
```
The fizz buzz function returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a loop and an if-else statement to check for the digit 7. The function then increments the result by 1 if the digit 7 is found. If the digit 7 is not found, the function continues to the next number in the sequence by using the n//=13 operation.
