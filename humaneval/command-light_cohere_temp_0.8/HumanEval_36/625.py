```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    7 = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        digit = ord('7') - (ord('0') - (i%10))
        if i % 10 == 0 or i % 15 == 0:
            digit += 1
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0 and digit > 0:
            7 += 1
    return 7

# Test the function
assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0
assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2
assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3
```
This code defines a function fizz_buzz that counts the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers less than n and divisible by 11 or 13. It uses the basic arithmetic and loop to calculate this count and returns the result. This function is passed a test with the assert statement, which checks its correctness with the provided test cases.
