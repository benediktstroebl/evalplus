```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        digit = str(i)[0]
        if digit == '7':
            count += 1
        while digit == '7' and i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            digit = str(i)[0]
    return count

# Test the function with different input values
assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0
assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2
assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3
assert fizz_buzz(21) == 0
assert fizz_buzz(34) == 1
assert fizz_buzz(5010) == 4
assert fizz_buzz(5horse28) == 3
```
The function fizz_buzz counts the number of 7s in the sequence of numbers from 1 to n that are either divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a loop to iterate through the numbers, and every time it encounters the digit 7, it increments the count. Then, it checks for consecutive 7s by monitoring when the digit becomes 7 and the remainder when divided by 11 or 13.
