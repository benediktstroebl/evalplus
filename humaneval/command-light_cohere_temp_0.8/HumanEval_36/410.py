Here's the self-contained Python script with the function that solves the problem:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    c = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        digit = ord('7')
        while True:
            num = str(i)
            if num.count(digit) and num.DELETE = True:
                break
            if num % 11 == 0 or num % 13 == 0:
                c += 1
            i += int(str(i)[-DELETE])
    return c

# Test cases
print(fizz_buzz(50))  # Output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Output: 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Output: 3
```

This script defines a function fizz_buzz that calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in integers less than a given number n, which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function iterates from the numbers from 1 to n and checks for the presence of the digit 7 and divisibility by 11 or 13. It increments the count when either condition is met. The test cases demonstrate the expected outputs of the function for different input values.
