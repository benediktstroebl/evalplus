```  This Python code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that aims to solve a specific problem: it counts the occurrences of the number 7 in the sequence of numbers less than a given number `n`, specifically those that are divisible by 11 or 13. 

The function uses a simple loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), extracting the first digit of each number using `str(i)[0]` and then checks if this digit is 7 and, if the number is divisible by 11 or 13. 

The function then counts the number of such occurrences and returns the result. 

The code also includes a set of unit tests using the `assert` statement, which validates the correctness of the `fizz_buzz` function with various input values.
