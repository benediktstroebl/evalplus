This script defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the frequency of the digit 7 in numbers divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a loop to iterate through numbers less than the given input `n`, and counts the occurrences of the digit 7. The unit tests function `test_fizz_buzz` is used to verify the correctness of the `fizz_buzz` function, passing the test function as an argument and checking the output of the `fizz_buzz` function against the expected output.  This read the the and the tests for this function in the script!
