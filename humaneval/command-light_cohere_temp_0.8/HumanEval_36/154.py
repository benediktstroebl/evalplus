```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    # Initialize a count of the number 7 in the sequence less than n, but divisible by 11 or 13
    count_7 = 0

    for num in range(1, n+1):
        if (num % 11 == 7) or (num % 13 == 7):
            count_7 += 1

    return count_7

# Test suite
def test():
    assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0
    assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2
    assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run the test suite when the script is run directly
    test()
```

This code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the frequency of the number 7 in a sequence of numbers less than a given number, specifically numbers that are both divisible by 11 and 13. The function iterates through these numbers and checks if the 7th digit exists in the number, if it does, it increments the counter.

Finally, the test suite is run to validate the `fizz_buzz` function's behavior.
