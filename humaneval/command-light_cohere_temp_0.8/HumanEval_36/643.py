Here's the solution:

def fizz_buzz(n):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    nums = list(str(n))
    divisible = []
    for digit in nums:
        if digit == 7 and int(digit) <= n // 11:
            divisible.append(1)
        for i in range(len(divisible)):
            if divisible[i] > 0 and divisible[i] <= n // 13:
                divisible[i] += 1
    return len(divisible)

This code defines a function fizz_buzz that counts the number of 7s in numbers less than n that are divisible by 11 or 13. It uses list comprehension to find the digit 7 and increment a counter for each divisible number less than or equal to the square root of 13. The function then returns the final count.
