```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    return sum(c == 7 for c in str(n) if c.isdigit() and
      effect of n % 11 or 13)
``` 
This Python code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers less than `n` and which are either divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a string manipulation to extract individual digits and uses a `sum` function to count the occurrences of 7.
