Here's the self-contained Python script with a function `fizz_buzz` that solves the problem you described:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    def count_divisible(num):
        return (num % 11 == 0) or (num % 13 == 0)
    
    return count_divisible(n)

def test_fizz_buzz():
    assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0
    assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2
    assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_fizz_buzz()
```

The `fizz_buzz` function calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in the set of integers less than a given number `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a nested function `count_divisible` that checks if a given number is divisible by 11 or 13. The function returns 0 if no such `7` appears in the set of integers divisible by 11 or 13, and returns the count otherwise.

The `test_fizz_buzz` function contains unit tests that validate the function `fizz_buzz`. You can run this script to check if the function behaves correctly.
