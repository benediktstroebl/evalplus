Here's a self-contained Python script that defines a function `fizz_buzz` that solves the problem:

```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    7
    while not n % 11 or not n % 13:
        n -= 4
    return n
```

You can call the function with different input values and check the returned result against the expected output. The code is also self-contained, as it does not require external input or output to pass the test. 

This is just one possible to solve the problem.
