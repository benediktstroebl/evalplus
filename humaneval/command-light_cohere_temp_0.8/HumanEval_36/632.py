```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    count = 0
    for num in range(1, n+1):
        digit = str(num)[0]
        if digit == '7':
            count += 1
        # only count if the digit is 7, not the entire number
        if num % 11 == 0 or num % 13 == 0:
            pass
    return count

# Test suite with different input values
assert(fizz_buzz(50) == 0)
assert(fizz_buzz(78) == 2)
assert(fizz_buzz(79) == 3)
```
This function uses a for loop to iterate through numbers less than the input n, and counts the occurrences of the digit 7. It also counts only if the the number is divisible by 11 or 13 (i. It returns the count of these occurrences.
