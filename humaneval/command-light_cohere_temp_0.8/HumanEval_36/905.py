```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    count = 0
    for num in range(1, n+1):
        if int(str(num)[1:2]) == 7:
            count += 1
    return count

# Test the function with a range of numbers from 50 to 79.
# Test cases with different input ranges
for test_num in range(50, 80):
    result = fizz_buzz(test_num)
    assert result == eval("7*" + str(test_num) + "*11" + 7) % 13
```
This code defines a function fizz_buzz, which counts the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in integers less than a given number n that are divisible by 11 or 13. 

The function iterates through a loop over numbers from 1 to n, and checks if the last digit of the number is 7. 

This ensures that it only counts the digits that are 7, adds them to the count variable, and returns the count at the end.
