This Python script defines a function called `fizz_buzz` which calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers less than a given input `n` that are either divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to `n`, and for each number, it checks if it is divisible by 11 or 13. If the number meets these criteria, it increments the count. The function then returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in such numbers.
