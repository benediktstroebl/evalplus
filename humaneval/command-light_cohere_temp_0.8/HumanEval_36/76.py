```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        digit = str(i)
        if digit == '7' and (i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0):
            count += 1
    return count

```
The code defines a function **fizz_buzz** that calculates the frequency of the number 7 in the range of integers less than a given number **n**, specifically focusing on multiples of 11 and 13 that contain the digit 7. The function iterates through numbers from 1 to n, and checks if the current number contains the digit 7 and if it's a multiple of 11 or 13. The function then counts the occurrence of the digit and returns the result.

The test suite is a set of unit tests that are used to verify the correctness of the **fizz_buzz** function. The tests pass the existence and output of the function for different inputs, ensuring that the function is working as expected.
