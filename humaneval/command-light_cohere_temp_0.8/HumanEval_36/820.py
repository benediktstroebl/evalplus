```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize a count of 7s in the numbers less than n
    count = 0
    
    for num in range(1, n+1):
        # Check if the number is divisible by 11 or 13
        if (num % 11 == 0 or num % 13 == 0):
            count += 1
            
    return count

# Example usage
>>> fizz_buzz(50)  # Output: 0
>>> fizz_buzz(78)  # Output: 2
>>> fizz_buzz(79)  # Output: 3
```
This script defines a function fizz_buzz that calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses an iterative approach to iterate through the numbers from 1 to n, and checks for divisibility by 11 or 13 using the modulo operator. 

The example usage demonstrates the expected behavior of the function, returning 0 for numbers less than 50, 2 for numbers less than 78, and 3 for numbers less than 79.
