The code defines a function called `fizz_buzz` that calculates the frequency of the digit 7 in the numbers from 1 to `n`. The function iterates through numbers and checks if the current digit is 7 and if the number is divisible by 11 or 13, incrementing a counter. Then, the function returns the count, which represents the number of times the digit 7 appears in the numbers from 1 to `n`.

The code also includes a test suite with three test functions: `test_fizz_buzz`, `test_fizz_buzz2`, and `test_fizz_buzz3`, each checking the function's behavior for a different input value.  The test suite using the testing the `fizz_buzz` function by passing different input values and asserting that the output matches the expected result. 
code can be executed by running it in a Python environment.
