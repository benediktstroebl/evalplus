```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    return 7 - (n // 13) if n > 6 else 0

# Test cases
print(fizz_buzz(50))
print(fizz_buzz(78))
print(fizz_buzz(79))
print(fizz_buzz(80))
print(fizz_buzz(81)))
```
The function fizz_buzz takes an integer n as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a relation and basic mathematical operations to achieve this.
