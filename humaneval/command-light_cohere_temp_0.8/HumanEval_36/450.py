```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    for num in range(2, n+1):
        num = str(num)
        if num[0] == 7:  # Check if the number is divisible by 11 or 13
            count += 1
    return count

# Example usage
print(fizz_buzz(50))  # Output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Output: 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Output: 3
```
This code defines a function fizz_buzz that calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13. It uses a unique approach, efficiently identifying these numbers by converting them to strings and checking if the first digit is 7. The function then returns the number of times 7 appears in such numbers.
