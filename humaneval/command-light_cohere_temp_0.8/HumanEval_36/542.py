```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    for num in range(1, n+1):
        if num % 11 == 7 or num % 13 == 7:
            count += 1
    return count

# Test cases
print(fizz_buzz(50))  # Output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Output: 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Output: 3
print(fizz_buzz(10))  # Output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(31))  # Output: 3)
```
This Python code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in integers less than a given number `n` that are both divisible by 11 and 13. The function iterates through numbers from 1 to `n`, checking if the number is divisible by both 11 and 13, and if the number is 7. The function then counts the occurrences of 7 and returns the total count as its output.
