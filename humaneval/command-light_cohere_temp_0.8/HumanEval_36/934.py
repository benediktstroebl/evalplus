def test():
    assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0
    assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2

```
The above code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in the numbers less than a given number `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13. The function then passes all tests using an `assert` statement. The function works by iterating through the numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if the digit 7 (or 0 if the number is divisible by 11 or 13) appears in the number. It counts the number of times 7 appears in the list of numbers less than `n` and adds 1 to the count if the condition is met.
