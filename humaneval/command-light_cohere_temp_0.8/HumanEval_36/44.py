```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    count = 0
    i = 2
    while n >= i:
        if (n%11==0 or n%13==0) and int(str(n))[7] != 0:
            count += 1
        n = n // 10
    return count

# Test the function with different input values
assert(fizz_buzz(50) == 0)
assert(fizz_buzz(78) == 2)
assert(fizz_buzz(79) == 3)
```
This code defines a function fizz_buzz that calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in the sequence of numbers less than n, which are divisible by 11 or 13. It uses a tested in a loop and adds the count of such numbers. Finally, it returns the count.
