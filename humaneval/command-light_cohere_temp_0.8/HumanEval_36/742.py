```python

    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):

        if digit == '7':

``` 
This code provides a function fizz_buzz which takes an integer n as input and returns the count of 7 in the set of integers less than n that are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a test to verify if the solution is correct for the input values.
