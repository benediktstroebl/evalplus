```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    # Initialize a count of zero
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through integers less than n
    for num in range(10, n+1, 2):
        # Check if the number is divisible by 11 or 13
        if (num % 11 == 0 or num % 13 == 0):
            count += 1
            
    return count

# Test the function with a few values of n
assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0
assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2
assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3
```
The above Python script defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in the sequence of integers less than a given number `n` which are either divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses an `for loop` to iterate through these numbers, and a count is kept to track the number of such digits. The test code at thel end checks if the function's outputs match the expected results for a few test cases.
