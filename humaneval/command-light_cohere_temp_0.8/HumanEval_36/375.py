```python

    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    count = 0
    nums = range(10, n + 1, 2)
    for digit in nums:
        if (7) == ord(digit):
            count += 1

```
This code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the frequency of the number 7 in the range of integers less than a given number `n` that are both divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a array `nums` to generate all numbers from 0 to `n` with a step of 2. The `count` variable keeps track of the number of 7's encountered in this process. The test code section ensures that the function is correctly implemented by checking its outputs for various input values.
