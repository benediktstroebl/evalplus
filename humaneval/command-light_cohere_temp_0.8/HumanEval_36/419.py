```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    count = 0
    for num in range(1, n+1):
        if any(c % 11 or c % 13 for c in str(num)):
            count += 1
    return count

# Test suite
test_fizz_buzz = [
    'def test_fizz_buzz():
        assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0
        assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2
        assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3
    ]
``` 
The provided code defines a Python function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in integers less than a given number `n`, which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if any digit in the number string is divisible by 11 or 13 using the `any()` function and the modulo operator. The function then returns the test suite, which verifies that the `fizz_buzz` function outputs the correct results for the provided test cases.
