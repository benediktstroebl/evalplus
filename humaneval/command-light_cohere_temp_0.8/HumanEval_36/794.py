```
This function, fizz_buzz, takes an integer n as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to n, and for each number, it checks if the digit is 7 or if it is a number less than 10 and a multiple of 11 or 13. The function then adds 1 to the count if the digit is found in the number.
