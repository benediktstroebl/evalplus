```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    return sum(1 for d in range(10) if any(c for c in str(n) if c == 7 and c <= int(n) // 11 or int(n) % 13 == c))
```
The code defines a function fizz_buzz that calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers less than n, specifically those that are divisible by 11 or 13. The function iterates through a loop over the digits from 0 to 9, and for each digit d, it checks if any character c in the string representation of n is 7, and if c is less than or equal to the square root of n divided by 11 or 13. If any such character, it adds 1 to the count. The function then returns the value of the count.
