Here's the code:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        digit = ord('7')
        num = chr(i % 10 + digit)
        if num <= '9' or num == '':
            continue
        if num <= '11':
            num += 11
        elif num <= '13':
            num += 13
        if num % 10 == 0 and num in ('7', '17'):
            count += 1
    return count
```

This code defines a function `fizz_buzz` which calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in the integers less than a given number `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13. It uses a the important approach, iterating through numbers from 1 to `n`, and counting the occurrence of the digit 7 in a number that is either less than 10, and is either 7, 17, or is divisible by 11 or 13.
