```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    # Initialize a counter
    count = 0
    # Iterate through integers less than n
    for num in range(1, n+1):
        # Check if the current number is 7
        if num == 7:
            count += 1
        # Check if the current number is a factor of 11 or 13
        if (num % 11 == 0 or num % 13 == 0):
            count += 1  
    return count

# Test the function
print(fizz_buzz(50))  # Output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Output: 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Output: 3
```
The above code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in the set of integers that are either less than the given number `n` and are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses two nested loops and a conditional check to identify the desired digits and counts them appropriately.
