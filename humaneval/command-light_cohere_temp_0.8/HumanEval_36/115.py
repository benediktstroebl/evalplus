Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem of counting the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than a given number and divisible by 11 or 13:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if int(str(i))[7] == 7 and i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            count += 1
    return count
```
This code defines a function fizz_buzz that calculates the frequency of the number 7 in the given range of numbers. It iterates through numbers from 1 to n, checks if the given number has the digit 7 and is divisible by 11 or 13, and increments the count if the condition is met.
