This code defines a function called **fizz_buzz** that Gmina  a number n and returns the number of times the digit 7, 8, or 9 appear in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13. It uses a testing to verify the function's correctness, the function will count the number of 7s, 8s, and 9s in the given number and will pass the test.
