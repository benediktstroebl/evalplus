```
This Python code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in integers less than a given number `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13. 

The function utilizes a nested helper function called `count_seven_in_divisibles` to filter out non-negative numbers less than `n`, and then count the occurrences of the digit 7 in those numbers. 

The function is then tested with different input values, and the output values correspond to the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers divisible by 11 or 13, respectively.

This code efficiently solves the problem and passes the tests.
