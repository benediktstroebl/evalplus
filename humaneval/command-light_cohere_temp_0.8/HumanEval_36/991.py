The provided Python code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers less than a given input `n` which are both divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a testing by adding test functions (`test_fizz_buzz`, `test_fizz_buzz2`, and `test_fizz_buzz3`) to a `__main__` block. These test tests to assert the tests that the function's outputs are correct for the provided input values.
