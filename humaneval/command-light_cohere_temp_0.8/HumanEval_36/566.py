```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        digit = str(i)[0]
        if digit == '7':
            count += 1
        while digit == '7':
            digit = str(i)[0]
        if digit == '0' or digit == '9':
            break
    return count

# Test cases
print(fizz_buzz(50))
print(fizz_buzz(78))
print(fizz_buzz(79))
```
This script defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than a given number `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13. The function iterates through the numbers and checks if the first digit is 7, incrementing the count. If the loop completes without a digit being 7, or it's 0 or 9, the loop breaks. This ensures that we only numbers with 7 in their first position are counted. 

The function is then tested with the provided test cases.
