Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you provided:

```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 0:
        return 0

    # Count the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if (i % 11 == 7) or (i % 13 == 7):
            count += 1

    return count
```

This code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers less than a given input `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a optimized approach to achieve this, which iterates through numbers up to `n` and checks for divisibility by 11 or 13, effectively counting the number of 7s.
