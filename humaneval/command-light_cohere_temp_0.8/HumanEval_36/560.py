The code is a straightforward implementation of the problem using a for loop and a simple counting mechanism. 

Let's break down the approach:
1.: `def fizz_buzz(n: int):` introduces a function named `fizz_buzz` that takes an integer `n` as input.
2. `n`:  This response is a series of digits from 0 to 9, including 7, in the numbers less than `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13. The function aims to find and count the occurrences of the digit 7.
3. `""" returns the value 0, as it was the first number with the digit 7.
4. If the loop reaches a `n`, indicating that the number has no digit 7, and no need to count occurrences.
5. The `7` condition in the loop helps to skip the loop and move to the next number when the current number does not contain the digit 7.

This is a basic and efficient approach to solve the problem, and the function `fizz_buzz` can be used to calculate the number of times the digit 7 appears in numbers less than a given number `n`.
