This Python script defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the frequency of the digit 7 in numbers below a given input `n`, identifying divisibility by 11 or 13. The function then includes a corresponding test suite to ensure its correctness. The `__main__` block further includes a test execution environment, running the test suite to validate the function's accuracy.
