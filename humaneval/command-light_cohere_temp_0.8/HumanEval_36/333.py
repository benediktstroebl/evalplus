Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function `fizz_buzz` that solves the problem of counting the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than a given number n, which are divisible by 11 or 13:

```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    count = 0
    s = set()
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        num = str(i)
        if len(set(num)) == 1 and num[0] == 7 and '11' <= int(num) < '13':
            s.add(num)
        if i in s:
            count += 1
    return count
```

This function takes an integer n as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n, which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a set data structure to efficiently track the numbers it has encountered so far. The loop iterates through numbers from 1 to n, and for each number, it checks if it's a single digit 7 and whether it's divisible by 11 or 13. If the number meets these criteria, it's added to the set. Then, the function uses the set to efficiently count the numbers it has encountered so far and returns the count of such numbers.
