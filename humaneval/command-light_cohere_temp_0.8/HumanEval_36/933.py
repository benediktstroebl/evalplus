```python

    zeros = fives = 0
    
    # Iterate through numbers from 0 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        digit = str(i)[0]
        # If the digit is 7, increment the count of zeros
        if digit == '7':
            zeros += 1
        # If the digit is 5, increment the count of fives
        if digit == '5':
            fives += 1
        # Check if the number is divisible by 11 or 13
        if (i % 11 == 0) or (i % 13 == 0):
            pass # Continue to the next iteration
    # Return the count of zeros and fives
    return zeros, fives
```

This function, `fizz_buzz`, takes an integer `n` as input and returns a tuple of two integers: the number of zeros in the numbers from 0 to `n` and the number of 5s. It uses a 0- 5 and 7 are the only digits that will cause a count of zeros or fives in the numbers from 0 to n. It uses a string representation of numbers and the `range` function to iterate through numbers from 0 to `n`. The function then counts the number of occurrences of each digit and returns the counts.
