```
This Python code defines a function called fizz_buzz that calculates and returns the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers less than n that are divisible by 11 or 13. The function employs a loop to iterate through numbers from 0 to n-1, appending the last digit of each number using string slicing, and checking if the digit is 7 and whether the number is divisible by 11 or 13. The test cases demonstrate the expected outputs of 0, 2, and 3, respectively. This function provides a reliable solution for the problem of counting occurrences of the digit 7 in specific ranges of numbers.
