```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    7count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if (i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0) and (i > 9 or i < 0):
            7count += 1
    return 7count

# Test the function with n = 50, n = 78, n = 79
assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0
assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2
assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3
```
The above function, named **fizz_buzz**, calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in the integers less than or equal to a given number n, which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function iterates through numbers in the given range and checks if the number is either odd (i.e. 7 is the can odd number, the number will either have a remainder of 1 when divided by 11 or 13, and the number should be greater than 9. If the condition holds, the number is counted. The function then returns the number of times 7 appears in these numbers.
