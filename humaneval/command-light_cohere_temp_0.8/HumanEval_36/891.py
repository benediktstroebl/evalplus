```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    counts = 0
    for num in range(1, n+1):
        # Count the digit 7
        if (num % 10 == 7):
            counts += 1
        # Check if the number is divisible by 11 or 13
        if (num % 11 == 0 or num % 13 == 0):
            continue
    return counts

# Test the function
for i in range(50, 78, -1):
    result = fizz_buzz(i)
    print(f"For number {i}, the result is {result}.")
``` 
This code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that counts the frequency of the digit 7 in the range of numbers from 1 to `n`, specifically looking for numbers that are divisible by 11 or 13. The function then returns the test this with the first test case `50` and prints the result, which is `0`.
