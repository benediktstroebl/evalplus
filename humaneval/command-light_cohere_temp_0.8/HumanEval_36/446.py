Here's the code you asked for:

```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    count = 0
    for num in range(1, n+1):
        if (num % 11 == 0 or num % 13 == 0) and num != 7:
            count += 1
    return count

# Test suite
def test_fizz_buzz():
    assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0
 assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2
 assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3
 assert fizz_buzz(100) == 4
 assert fizz_buzz(101) == 5
 assert fizz_buzz(1000) == 7
 assert fizz_buzz(1001) == 8
 assert fizz_buzz(10000) == 9
```

This code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in the sequence of integers less than a given number `n`, which are either divisible by 11 or 13. The function then provides test cases to ensure its correctness.
