Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of counting the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than a given number n, which are divisible by 11 or 13:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
    Returns 0 if n is not a divisor of 11 or 13, otherwise returns the count.
    """
    expected return: an integer
    """
    if n not in (7, 11, 13):
        return 0
    return sum(1 for d in range(1, n+1) if (n % 11 == d or n % 13 == d))
```
This code defines a function fizz_buzz that calculates the frequency of the digit 7 in numbers divisible by 11 or 13, and specifically returns 0 if the input n is not a divisor of 11 or 13. The function utilizes a testing by checking if n is within the list of divisors of 11 or 13, and returns the count of occurrences of 7 in numbers up to the input n if it is. If n does not meet this expected behavior, the function returns 0, ensuring the function has the correct behavior.
