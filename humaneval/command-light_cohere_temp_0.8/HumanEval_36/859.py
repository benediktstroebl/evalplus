This code defines a function fizz_buzz that calculates the frequency of the number 7 in the set of numbers less than n and divisible by 11 or 13. It employs a tested in a loop using a while condition to iterate through numbers starting from 2 up to n. The frequency of the number is then tracked using the variable c. The loop continues until the digit 7 is encountered in the number. Once it does, the count of 7 is added to the c variable.
