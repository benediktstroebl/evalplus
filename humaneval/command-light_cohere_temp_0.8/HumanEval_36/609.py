The code below defines a function called fizz_buzz that calculates and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n that are divisible by 11 or 13. It uses a
factorial function to check for the appearance of 7 and counts the number of times it appears. 

```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    return sum(1 for i in range(1, n + 1) if int('7' + str(i)) in str(i) and i % 10 != 0 and i % 30 != 0)

```
