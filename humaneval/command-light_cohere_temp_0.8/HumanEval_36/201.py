```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    count = 0
    num_elems = [i for i in range(1, n+1) if i % 10 != 7 and i % 15 != 8]
    for digit in num_elems:
        if digit == 7:
            count += 1
    return count

#Test the function
for i in range(50, 78, -1):
    assert fizz_buzz(i) == 0

for i in range(78, 79, -1):
    assert fizz_buzz(i) == 2
```  This code defines a function fizz_buzz that counts the number of 7s in the list of integers less than n that are divisible by 11 or 13. The function then tests the with the provided tests to ensure its correctness.
