This code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than a given number `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a process by initializing a variable `count` to 0 and then, iterating until `n` is less than 10. Within the digit of `n` is then checked against the digits that, when divided by 10, result in a number divisible by 11 or 13. If the current digit is 7 and the remainder is 11 or 13, the `count` variable is incremented. The function then returns the value of `count`, representing the number of times the digit 7 appears in such numbers.
