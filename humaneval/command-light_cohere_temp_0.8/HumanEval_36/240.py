This Python code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the frequency of the digit 7 in numbers less than a given number `n`, specifically those that are divisible by 11 or 13. The function iterates through numbers from 10 down to `n`, and counts the occurrences of 7. Then, it returns the frequency, which is the number of times 7 appears in the specified range of numbers.
