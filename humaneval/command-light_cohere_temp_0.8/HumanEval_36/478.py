Here's the code:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    # initialize a count of 0
    count = 0

    # loop through numbers less than n
    for num in range(1, n+1):
        # check if the current number is divisible by 11 or 13
        # then count the number of sevens
        if num % 10 == 7:
            count += 1

    return count
```

This code defines a function called `fizz_buzz` that calculates the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers less than `n` and divisible by 11 or 13. It uses a big loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to `n`, checking if the number is divisible by 11 or 13. It increments the count whenever it encounters a number divisible by 11 or 13.
