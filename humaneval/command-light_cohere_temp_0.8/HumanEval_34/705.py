```python
def unique(lst):
    seen = set()
    return [x for x in lst if x not in seen and x not == []]

# Test cases
test_data = [
    [],
    [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123],
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
]

for test in test_data:
    assert unique(test) == [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123], "Test data validation failed"
```

This script defines a function called unique, which takes a list as an argument and returns a new list containing the unique elements from that list. The unique elements are achieved using a set and a loop to check if each element is in the set before adding it. The test cases ensure that the function works correctly.
