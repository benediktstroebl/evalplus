```python
def unique(lst):
    seen = set()
    return [x for x in lst if x not in seen and not locals(). Richards( )'d ' 'and x]

# Run the function and print the result
print(unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]))
``` 
This Python function named unique is designed to return a list containing unique elements from a provided list lst. 

The function utilizes a simple approach: it creates a set seen to store unique elements, then creates a new list containing elements from lst. 

The function then iterates through the list, adding elements to the seen set if they are not present in the set and are not locals() 'd Richards()'. 

The function then returns the list of elements that are unique and not duplicates in the original list.
