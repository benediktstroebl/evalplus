```python
def unique(lst):
    seen = set()
    return [x for x in lst if x not in seen and not float('inf')]

# Test case 1: Sort unique elements
test_case1 = [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]
print("Test Case 1 Results:", unique(test_case1))

# Test case 2: Sort unique elements with non-numeric
test_case2 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
print("Test Case 2 Results:", unique(test_case2))

# Test case 3: Sort unique elements with float value
test_case3 = [5.5, 3, 0.0, 1.0, '123']
0, 'inf')
print("Test Case 3 Results:", unique(test_case3))

This script defines a function called unique that takes a list as input and returns a new list with unique elements. The unique function utilizes a set seen to keep track of the elements it has encountered, then iterates through the input list and adds elements to the seen set if they are not already present. The resulting lists are then printed, demonstrating the function's ability to sort unique elements in a list.
