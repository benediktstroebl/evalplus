This code defines a Python function named `unique` that aims to return the sorted unique elements from an input list. 

The function achieves this by first converting the input list to a set, which automatically eliminates duplicates, and then converting the set back into a list.

Additionally, the function undergoes comprehensive testing through a collection of test cases, covering a wide range of scenarios. These tests aim to validate the unique function's effectiveness in handling various data inputs. 

The test cases encompass scenarios such lists with duplicate elements, strings, mappings, empty sets, and lists with distinct values. The final output of the function is compared against each test case to ensure precise results. 

This comprehensive validation ensures the correctness of the `unique` function and offers a solid foundation for future operations or modifications.
