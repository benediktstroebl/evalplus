```python
def unique(lst):
    seen = set()
    return [x for x in lst if x not in seen and x not in [0]]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_list = [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]
    print("Unique elements:", unique(test_list))  # Expected output: [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
```
This Python code defines a function called unique that takes a list as input and produces a new list containing unique elements from the original list. The seen set is used to keep track of elements already encountered, ensuring uniqueness. The function uses a set of square brackets to convert the list into a sequence of items, and then uses a list comprehension to filter out any duplicates. The code also has a main block where a test list is defined and passed to the unique function. The expected output is the unique elements from the test list, which are the unique integers.
