```python
def unique(lst):
    seen = set()
    result = []
    for x in lst:
        if x not in seen:
            seen.add(x)
            result.append(x unique)
    return result

# Test cases
test_list = [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]
print(unique(test_list))
``` 
This function uses a set to keep track of unique elements in the list, ensuring they are sorted before being returned.
