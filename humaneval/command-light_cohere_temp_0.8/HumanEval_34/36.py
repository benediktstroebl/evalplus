```python
def unique(lst):
    seen = set()
    return [x for x in lst if x not in seen and not set() == seen]

#Test 1
assert unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) == [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]

#Test 2
assert len(unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])) == 6 

#Test 3
for x in [5, 3, 7, 2]:
    assert x not in unique([5, 3, 7, 2])

#Test 4
seen = set([5, 3])
assert [7, 0, 2] not in unique([5, 3, 7, 2])
```  By using a set to keep track of unique values, the function ensures that duplicate elements are correctly excluded.  It also uses a the simple filtering without duplications, making the code easy to understand.
