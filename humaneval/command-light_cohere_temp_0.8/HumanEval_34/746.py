```python
def unique(lst):
    seen = set()
    return [x for x in lst if x not in seen and x not in [-None, '', ']] + seen

# Test cases
test_unique = [
    [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123],
    [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3],
    [-1, 2, 3, 'abc', 5, 'def'],
    [(), [], [1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']],
    ['123', '', 'ABC', 1]
]

for test_list, expected in test_unique:
    got = unique(test_list)
    print(f"Test {test_list}: {got}, Expected: {expected}")
    assert got == expected
```
This function, unique, accepts a list as input and outputs a new list containing the list's unique elements. The function utilizes the unique elements using the same logic as the original problem, which is implemented using a set to monitor the elements that have been seen before. 

The test cases are also provided, which can be used to validate the function's behavior.
