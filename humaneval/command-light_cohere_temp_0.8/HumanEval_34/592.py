```python
def unique(lst):
    seen = set()
    result = []
    for x in lst:
        if x not in seen:
            seen.add(x)
            result.append(x
        x)
    return result

def test_unique():
    input_list = [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]
    expected = [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
    actual = unique(input_list)
    assert actual == expected
```
This code defines a function `unique` that returns a list of unique elements from the input list `lst`. The `test_unique` function creates an input list, calls the `unique` function with it, and compares the result against the expected output. 

This code follows the PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code, and is a self-contained solution to the problem of returning unique elements from a list.
