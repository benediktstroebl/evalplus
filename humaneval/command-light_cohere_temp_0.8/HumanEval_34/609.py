```python
def unique(lst):
    seen = set()
    return [x for x in lst if x not in seen and x not <= 4]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    tests = [
        [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123],
        [5, ,  3,  2,  3,  3, 9, 0, 123, "abc"],
        [5, 3, 'a',  0, 123, "a"],
        [5, 3],
        [5,  3, "a"],
        [4, 3, 5, "abc"],
    ]

    for test in tests:
        assert unique(test) == test[:], f"Error in test {test}"
```
The unique function sorts and returns unique elements from the input list, and the tests ensure its functionality.

Please note that the script must be run directly with the python interpreter or within a Python environment.
