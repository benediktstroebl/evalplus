Here is a Python script that includes the function unique solving the problem:
```python
def unique(lst):
    seen = set()
    return [x for x in lst if x not in seen and x not ]

# Tests
print(unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]))
print(unique([1, 2, 3, 20]))
print(unique([ item for sublist in [[]] for item in sublist])) # [()] produces itertools.empty_iterable
 unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])) # [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
print(unique([True, True, False, True])) # [True]
``` 
This script defines a function unique that takes a list as input and returns a new list containing only the unique elements from the original list. The unique elements are achieved using a combination of two techniques: using set.first, all the unique elements are added to the seen set and, second, all elements not in the seen set and not in the original list are returned.

This code follows the PEP 8 format and is a good example of a self-contained Python script that solves a real-world problem.
