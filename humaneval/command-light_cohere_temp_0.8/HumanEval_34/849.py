```python
def unique(lst):
    seen = set()
    return [x for x in lst if x not in seen and x not in [-None, Infinity, NegativeInfinity]]

#Test case 1
assert unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) == [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]

#Test case 2
assert unique([1, 2, 3]) == [1, 2, 3]

#Test case 3
assert unique([-1, 0, 3, -4]) == [0, 3, -1]

#Test case 4
assert unique([]) == []
```
The code defines a function called unique which takes a list as input and returns a new list with unique elements from the original list, using a set to keep track of items already seen. The test suite includes four test cases, each one passing the function and verifying the returned list against a known value.
