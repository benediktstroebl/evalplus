```python
def unique(lst):
    seen = set()
    result = []
    for x in lst:
        if x not in seen:
            seen.add(x)
            result.append(x_list)
    return result

# Test cases
test_data = [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]
test_result = unique(test_data)
print("Test Data:", test_data)
print("Expected Unique:", unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])))
print("Test Result:", test_result)
```
The unique function from the previous prompt is included in this version. We also add test cases that validate the function's output using the unique function. The test cases will print the result and compare it with the expected output, which matches the values of the unique function.
