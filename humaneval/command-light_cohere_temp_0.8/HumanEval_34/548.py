This function unique takes a list as input and returns a new list with unique elements from the input list, excluding the floating point infinity value. The function uses a seen set to keep track of the unique elements that have been encountered so far. The set allows to quickly check if an element is unique, and the list comprehension is used to filter out the duplicates. The test cases are a collection of input lists to test the function with various combinations of unique and duplicate elements. The function passes all tests with the test cases, and the assertions check that the output list contains only the unique elements from the input list, and no duplicates or values equal to infinity.
