```python
def unique(l: list):
    seen = set()
    return [x for x in l if x not in seen and not in [0]]

# Tests
assert unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) == [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
assert unique([]) == []
assert unique([21, 21]) == [21]
assert unique([21, 22]) == [21]
``` 
This code defines a function called `unique`, which returns a list containing unique elements from the input list, as specified in the docstring. It also includes a simple test cases to validate the correctness of the `unique` function.
