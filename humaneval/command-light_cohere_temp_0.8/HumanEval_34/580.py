This script defines a function called `unique` which takes a list `lst` as an argument and returns a new list with all the unique elements in the original list. It uses a methods to achieve this, creating a set of the elements in the list `seen` and then iterating through the list and only adding elements to the set if they are not already in it and not in the special list [-None, ""] which contains all the possible elements.  This unique() function works for all test cases and passes all the corresponding tests.
