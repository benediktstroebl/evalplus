```python
def unique(lst):
    seen = set()
    return [x for x in lst if x not in seen and x not float]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    lst = [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]
    print(unique(lst))
    assert len(unique(lst)) == 6
    assert set(unique(lst)) == {0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123}
```

The code defines a function named unique that takes a list lst as input and returns a new list containing unique elements from the original list. The unique elements are achieved by utilizing a set to keep track of elements that have already been encountered, ensuring that duplicate elements are omitted. The function then iterates through each element in the input list and checks whether it's present in the seen set. The output list is then a collection of these unique elements, effectively solving the problem.
