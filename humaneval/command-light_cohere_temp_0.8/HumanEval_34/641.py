Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of returning unique elements from a list:
```python
def unique(lst):
    seen = set()
    return [x for x in lst if x not in seen and x not in []]

# Test cases
tests = [
    [list [_ for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)],
    [list ([1, 2, 3]) for _ in range(1000)],
    [set()],
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
]

for test in tests:
    actual = unique(test)
    print(f"Expected: {', ', '.join(test)}')
    print(f"Actual: {', '.join(actual)}")
    assert actual == test
```
This function `unique` takes a list `lst` as input and uses a set `seen` to keep track of the unique elements seen so far. It then iterates through through each element in `lst` that is not in the `seen` set and not in the empty list to return. The output of this function will be a list of unique elements.

Please note that the test cases are in the `tests` list, and they are being iterated using a `for` loop.
