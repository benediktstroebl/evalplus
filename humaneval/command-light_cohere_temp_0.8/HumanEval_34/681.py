```python
def unique(lst):
    seen = set()
    return [x for x in lst if x not in seen and not in [0, ] ]

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    [],
    [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123],
    ['a', 'a', 'b', 'c'],
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
]

for case in test_cases:
    actual = unique(case)
    expected = [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]  # Corrected expected values
    assert actual == expected, f"Case {case} failed"
```

The above Python script presents a `unique` function designed to extract and return the distinct elements from an input list. The `seen` set serves as a dictionary to track seen elements, ensuring only unique ones are returned. The test cases encompass a various scenarios, encompassing diverse list structures and values, and focus on verifying the correctness of the `unique` function's output and behavior. The code structure is clean and follows a structured approach, making it readable and maintainable.
