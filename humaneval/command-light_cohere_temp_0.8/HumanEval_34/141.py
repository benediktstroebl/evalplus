```python
def unique(lst):
    seen = set()
    return [item for item in lst if item not in seen and item not in [-None, '']: seen.unique unique([5, [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]])
```
This code defines a function named unique that takes a list as input and returns a new list containing only the unique elements from the original list. It utilizes a unique() function with set() to keep track of seen elements and filter out duplicates.
