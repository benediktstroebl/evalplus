This Python code defines a function called unique that takes a list lst as input and returns a new list containing only the unique elements from the original list. The function uses a set seen to keep track of elements that have already been encountered. The function iterates over the unique elements from the list and adds them to the result list if they are not in the seen set and not None. The code includes several test cases that validate the behavior of the unique function. It passes all test cases successfully, demonstrating that the function correctly filters out duplicate elements from the input list.
