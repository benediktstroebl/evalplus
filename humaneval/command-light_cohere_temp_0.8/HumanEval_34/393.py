```  This code defines a function `unique` that returns a list of unique elements from a given list. The function uses a `seen` set to keep track of elements we've encountered so far. The function iterates through the the list and adds elements to the set. Then, it returns a list of elements that are not in the set. This self- function is entirely contained within the code and passes all test cases.
