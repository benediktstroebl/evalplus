# Unit tests for unique function

This code defines a unique function that removes duplicates from an input list and sorts its elements. The function then goes through each element in the list, and if it's not seen before, it's added to a set that tracks seen elements. The function then appends the unique(result) to a new list, which will contain all the unique elements from the original list. The unit tests for the's unique function are then used to test the function, ensuring that it works correctly.
