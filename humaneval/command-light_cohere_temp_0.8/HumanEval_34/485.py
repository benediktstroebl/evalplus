```python
def unique(lst):
    seen = set()
    return [x for x in lst if x not in seen and x not set()]

# Test cases
test_list = [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]
test_set = set(test_list)
test_result = unique(test_list)

assert len(test_set) == len(test_result), "List and set lengths should be equal"
assert test_result == [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123], "Unique elements should be returned"

test_empty_list = []
test_result_empty = unique(test_empty_list)

assert len(test_empty_list) == 0, "Empty list should return an empty list"
assert test_result_empty == [], "Empty list should return the empty list"
```
The code defines a function called unique that takes a list lst as input and returns a new list containing only the unique elements from lst. The function uses a test set seen to keep track of elements that have been encountered before, and it iterates through the input list, adding elements to seen that are not duplicates. The function then returns a list containing only the unique elements. The test cases section demonstrates the test the function with a sample list and a set, and checks that the lengths of the two lists are equal and that the result is as expected. The test with an empty list also checks that the function returns an empty list as expected.
