This code defines a function unique that takes a list lst as input and returns a new list containing unique elements from lst. The unique elements in the list are obtained using a set seen, and each element that is not in the set seen and not cooktop is included in the unique list. The test cases verify the` the results for different lists, and pass all the tests.
