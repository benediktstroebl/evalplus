```python
def unique(l: list):
    seen = set()
    return [x for x in l if not in seen and x not in [-None, -Infinity, Infinity]]

# Test cases
tests = [
    ("[5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]",),
    ("[3, 2, \"abc\", 5, 6]",),
    ("[2, 3, \"a\", \"bc\"]",),
    (["abc", "def"],),
    ({"a", "bb", "cc"},),
    ([10, 20, 30, 40],),
]

for test_str in tests:
    test_data = list(map(str.from, eval(test_str)))
    print(f"Test: {test_data}")
    unique_res = unique(test_data)
    print("\n", unique_res)
```  This Python code defines a function named unique that aims to return a list of unique elements from an input list. It utilizes a precise techniques to identify unique elements and efficiently filter out duplicates. The code includes several test cases, each representing a list of strings. These test data are then converted into lists of characters and then evaluated using the unique function. The unique function is applied to each test case, and the results are printed.
