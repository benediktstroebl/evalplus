```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list"""
    set1 = set(l)
    return list(set1)

def test_unique():
    assert unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) == [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
``` 
The code defines a function called unique that takes a list as input and returns a new list containing only the unique elements from the original list. This is unique function uses the important to note that it generates a new list without duplicates and passes the test.
