The function `unique` accepts a list `lst` and returns a new list with unique elements from the original list, which are also stored in a set `seen`. The set comparison is used to ensure uniqueness of the elements. This function is also includes a docstring, which provides a brief description of the function and its use. The test cases are defined to verify the correctness of the `unique` function.
