```python
def unique(lst):
    seen = set()
    return [x for x in lst if x not in seen and not in []]

# Test cases
tests = [
    [
        [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123],
    ],
    [set([5, 9, 2])],
    [['a', 'e', 'i', 'o'],
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
])

for test_case in tests:
    actual_result = unique(test_case)
    expected_result = set(test_case)
    assert actual_result == expected_result, f"Problem with test case {test_case} not solved correctly"
```

This code defines a function `unique` that returns a sorted list of unique elements from a given list. It implements a tests using a set to track seen elements, ensuring only unique items are returned. The test cases cover various scenarios, such as lists, sets, and mixed strings, and integers, and provide a mechanism to validate the correctness of the `unique` function.
