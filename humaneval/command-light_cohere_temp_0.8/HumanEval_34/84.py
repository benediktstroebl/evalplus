```python
def unique(lst):
    seen = set()
    return [x for x in lst if x not in seen and x not == 0]

# Test cases
assert unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) == [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
assert not unique([0, 2, 3])
assert not unique([5, 3, 'abc'])
assert not unique([5, 'abc', 3])
```
The provided code defines a function `unique` that returns a list of unique elements from an input list `lst`. It utilizes a set `seen` to track elements encountered so far. The function iterates through a elements in `lst` using a list comprehension, and only elements not in the seen set and not equal to zero are added to the result. The test cases demonstrate the unique's functionality, showcasing the expected behavior.
