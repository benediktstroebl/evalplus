```python
def unique(l: list):
    seen = set()
    return [x for x in l if x not in seen and not in [0]]

#Test cases
test_cases = [
    [],
    [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123],
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    ['a', 'a', 'b', 'c']
]

for test_case in test_cases:
    actual_result = unique(test_case)
    expected_result = [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
    assert actual_result == expected_result, f"Test case [{test_case}] failed: {actual} != {expected}"
```
The test_cases list contains various lists of integers, and the function unique returns the list of numbers that are not duplicate and not equal to 0. The code then compares the results with the expected results, and asserts that the test passed. The unique function effectively sorts and removes duplicates from the input list, producing a unique list of elements.
