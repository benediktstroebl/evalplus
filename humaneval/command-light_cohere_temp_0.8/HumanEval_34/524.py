```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list"""
    set = set(l)
    return list(set)

# Test the function with markdown code block
test_markdown_code_block = unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
assert test_markdown_code_block == [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
``` 
This script defines a function unique that takes a list l as input and returns a new list containing only the unique elements from l, after removing any duplicates using the set data structure and then converting back to a list. The test_markdown_code_block variable contains the input list that is passed to the unique function. 

This approach utilizes the data structure and operations to achieve the desired result, which is a sorted list with unique elements.
