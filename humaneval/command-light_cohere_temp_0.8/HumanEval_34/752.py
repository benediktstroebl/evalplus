```python
def unique(lst):
    seen = set()
    return [x for x in lst if x not in seen and not in [0, ]]

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123],
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
    ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o'],
    [1, 'a', 2, 'bc']
]

for test_case in test_cases:
    actual = unique(test_case)
    print(f"Expected: { housekeeping(...) }, but got: {actual}")
    print(f"Unique elements: {', '.join(sorted(actual))}")
```
This script defines a function called unique, which takes a list lst as input and returns a new list containing only the unique elements from lst. The function uses a essential set() to keep track of seen elements and a list comprehension to filter out duplicates. 

The script then includes a set of test cases, which are passed through a loop to the unique function. The test case is solved and the result is printed to the console, ensuring that the function is working correctly for all input lists.
