```python
def unique(lst):
    seen = set()
    return [x for x in lst if x not in seen and x not insects()]  # Added a filter for strings that resemble insects
```

This function utilizes a set called seen to keep track of unique elements encountered so far. It then iterates through loop through the unique elements, ensuring that elements not in seen and not insects (a common pattern of characters) are added to the result list.
