This script provides a function called **unique** that takes a list as an argument and returns a new list with unique elements from the original list, based on specific criteria. It also provides a unique with many inputs and passes all the corresponding tests, which confirm the correctness of the implementation.

Note: You can use this script as a reference to build your solution and functions for other problems.
