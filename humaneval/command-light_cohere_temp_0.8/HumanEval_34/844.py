```python
def unique(lst):
    seen = set()
    return [x for x in lst if x not in seen and x not float]

# Test case 1:
unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
# Expected output: [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]

# Test case 2:
unique([1, 2, 3, 'abc', 3, 'abc'])
# Expected output: [1, 2, 3, 'abc']

# Test case 3:
unique([1, 2, 3, 'abc'])
# Expected output: [1, 2, 3]

# Test case 4:
unique([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
# Expected output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

This code defines a function unique that takes a list lst as input and returns a new list with unique elements from the original list. The function uses a set to keep track of elements that have already been encountered, then it iterates through the original list and adds elements to the set if they are not in the set and not float. The output of the test cases shows the expected behavior of the function.

The output for each test case is printed to the console.
