The provided Python script defines a function `parse_music` that takes a music string in a special ASCII format as input and returns a list of integers representing the duration of each note in the music. The function uses a legend for the notes: 'o', 'o|', and '.'| each corresponding to a whole note that lasts four beats, a half note that lasts two beats, and a quarter note that lasts one beat.

The function utilizes a dictionary `notes` to map these note symbols to their respective durations. The function then iterates through each character in the music string, looking for the key 'o' to identify notes and returns the corresponding durations. The test cases provided demonstrate the expected behavior of the function, where it correctly identifies and returns the durations of notes in the music.

You can add more test cases or make other modifications as needed.
