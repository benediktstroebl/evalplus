Here's a self-contained Python function that correctly parses a music notation string and returns a list of integer beats corresponding to each note:
```python
from typing import List

def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    notes = {
        'o': 4,
        'o|': 2,
        '.|': 1
    }
    return [notes[ch] for ch in music_string.parse(music_string)]
```
This function takes a music string and uses a dictionary to quickly locate and return the number of beats corresponding to each note.

The `parse` method uses the `dict` function `items()` to iterate through each character in the music string and creates a list of corresponding beat numbers. The `parse_music` function is self-contained and can be used to solve the problem of parsing a music notation string.
