This code defines a function `parse_music` that takes a music string in a special ASCII format as input and returns a list of integers representing the duration of each note in the music. The function splits the by '|', converts the characters into integers, and then sorts them to get the correct duration order. The test_parse_music function contains a test case for an empty music string, which should return an empty list, and one for a string with just one 'o' note, which should return a list with a single element 1.  Finally, there are two test cases for strings in the format expected by the parse_music function.
