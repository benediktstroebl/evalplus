Here's the improved code:
```python
from typing import List

def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    notes = music_string.split(' 'o whole', 'half', 'quarter')

    beats = []
    for note in notes:
        note = note.split('|')
        time, note = int(note[0]) * 4 if note[0] == 'o' else int(note[0]) * 2 if note[1] == '|' else int(note[1]) 

        beats.append(time)

    return beats
```

This code segment is specifically designed to handle the parsing and conversion of musical note sequences into their corresponding beat counts. The function takes a string music_string as input and initially splits it into separate components using the split method. Then, it processes each component by splitting it into two characters (representing note and tempo) and converts the note value to the appropriate beat count (either 4 for whole notes or 2 for half notes, or 1 for quarter notes). Finally, the processed beat counts are collected in the beats list, and this function efficiently returns the list of beat counts, effectively representing the number of beats in the given musical sequence.
