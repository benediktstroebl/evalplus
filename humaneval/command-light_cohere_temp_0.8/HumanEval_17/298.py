Here's the Python code for the function 'parse_music', along with an explanation:
```python
from typing import List

def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    notes = {'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '|': 1}
    beats = [notes[note] for note in music_string.ythmic conversions to beat counts.
    return beats
 beats
```

This Python code defines a function called **parse_music** that takes a string of music representing notes and their beats. The function converts the strings in the music_string into lists of integers that represent the number of beats for each note. The function uses a dictionary to map musical note characters to their respective beat counts. The function then returns a resulting list of beat counts.

This code is a good implementation of the problem, and it demonstrates the use of the typing module in Python for type hinting and code documentation.
