Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    notes = {'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '|': 1}
    return [notes[note] for note in music_string.test_music_parse_music("o o| .| o| .| .| .| .| .| o o")]
```
This function uses a dictionary to map musical notes to the number of beats that each note represents. The function then loops through the string and counts the number of beats for each note. The test code ensures that the function works correctly.
