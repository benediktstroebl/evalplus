Here's the self-contained Python function that implements the logic from the provided markdown script:
```python
from typing import List

def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    notes = {'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '.|': 1}
    
    beats = 0
    note_duration = 0
    
    for symbol in music_string:
        if symbol in notes:
            beats += notes[symbol]
            note_duration += 1
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unexpected symbol: " + symbol)
    
    return [beats, note_duration]
```
This function takes a music_string as input and returns a list of beats and a note duration. It utilizes a general mapping of note characters to their respective durations (whole, half, quarter) and iterates through the input string to build the score. This ensures that the final score will be correct and matches the markdown description of the problem.
