```

This Python code defines a function 'parse_music' designed to parse a string representing musical notes in a specific format and return a list of integers indicating the number of beats corresponding to each note. The function employs a legend to map note characters to their respective beat values. The test cases in the last section aim to verify the correctness of the 'parse_music' function by comparing its output with the expected output based on the provided legend. The code successfully passes all test cases, demonstrating its ability to accurately parse musical note input.
