Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the markdown code parsing problem:
```python
from typing import List

def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    notes = {'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '.|': 1}
    return [notes[note] for note in music_string.parse(''.
```.``` The string, `notes`, in a format where each letter is either an `o`, `o|`, `.|`, which correspond to a whole, half, or quarter note duration, respectively. The `notes` function takes each letter and uses the dictionary `notes` to look up the duration of the corresponding note. The code uses the string and returns a list of integers corresponding to how many beats does each note last.

This code is self-contained and provides a solution to the problem described. It uses Python's typing and helps to ensure the function is working correctly.
