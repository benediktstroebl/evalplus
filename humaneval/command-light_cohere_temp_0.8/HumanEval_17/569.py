Here's the solution:
```python
from typing import List
def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    notes = music_string.split(" ") -> [map(int, music_string.split(" "). each of the total beat count, will be the length of each substring minus 1.
```
The above code splits the string by spaces, then uses a map function to convert the substring to integer, and finally gets the length of each substring by subtracting 1.
