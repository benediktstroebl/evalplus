Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the music note-to-beats conversion problem you provided:
```python
from typing import List

def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    notes = {
        'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '|': 1
    }
    beats = notes.get(music_string, default=4)
    
    result = []
    for b in beats:
        parts = music_string.split('|')
       
        parts = parts[::-1]
        result.append(parts.count(parts['.length()))
    
    return result
```
This function takes a string music_string as input and returns a list of integers representing the number of beats for each note in the music. It uses a legend provided in the docstring to map note characters to their respective beat values. 

Please note that the `get` method is used to provide a default value for the 'notes' dictionary, which is necessary in case a key is not found.
