```

The function 'parse_music' takes a string of music and parses it into a list of integers, which represents the number of beats corresponding to each note. The function then uses a dictionary `notes` to map the musical note characters to the number of beats. The function is designed to be both efficient and easy to use, and it passes all corresponding tests.
