The provided Python script defines a function `parse_music` that takes a music_string as input and returns a list of integers representing the number of beats for each note in the music. The function uses a list of musical notes as a dictionary to map the notes to the number of beats they last for. It uses string manipulation techniques to split the music_string into individual beats and then uses the built-in function `map` to apply the mapping to the beats in the music_notes list.
