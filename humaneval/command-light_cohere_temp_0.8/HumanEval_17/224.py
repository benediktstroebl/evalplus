```python
from typing import List
def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    notes = {'o' : 4, 'o|' : 2, '.|' : 1}
    beats = music_string.split(' ')
    N = len(beats)//len(notes.print(notes.values())
    example the\, i = 0
    return [notes[beat[i].lower()] for beat in beats[i:]]
```
This Python code defines a function parse_music that takes a string music_string as input and returns a list of integers. The function is designed to parse a string representing musical notes in a special ASCII format and return the number of beats for each note, as specified in the legend. This problem aims to split the music string by spaces, identify each note with its corresponding beat using the provided dictionary, and then extract the numerical values for each note by applying the dictionary to each beat string.
