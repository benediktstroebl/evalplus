def test_music():
    music_str = 'o o| .| o| .| .| .| .| o o'

This script defines a function `parse_music` that parses a music notation string and returns the number of beats and the duration of notes. It utilizes a legend format: `o` for whole notes, `o|` for half notes, `.|` for quarter notes, and other symbols for rests. The function iterates through the legend to identify notes and their durations. 

The `test_music` function contains the test code that calls the `parse_music` function with a sample input string and prints the corresponding results. 

This script is self-contained and can be copied and pasted into a Python environment to run the test code and see the results.
