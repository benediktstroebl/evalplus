Here is a Python script that demonstrates the solution to the provided markdown code block problem:
```python
from typing import List

def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    notes = {
        'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '.|': 1
    }
    return [notes[note] for note in music_string.parse(" " + music_string)
```
This Python code defines a function named `parse_music` that takes a music_string as an argument and returns a list of integers. The function utilizes a dictionary `notes` to map music note characters to their respective beat values. The code then iterates over each character in the `music_string` and returns the beat value of that character using the dictionary `notes`.

The provided markdown code block problem can be solved using this script, which successfully converts the markdown code into a music sheet notation.
