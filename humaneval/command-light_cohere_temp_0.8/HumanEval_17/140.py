```python
from typing import List

def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    notes = {'o' : 4, 'o|' : 2, '.' : 1, 'o' : 4}
    return [notes[ch] for ch in music_string.arr music_string.split()
 string. str. `o05 a i just you analyze a special music. If it is a in the format specified, we should be able to do this using basic Python functionality.
