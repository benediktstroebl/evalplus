Here's the Python script with a self-contained function `parse_music` that splits a music string into a list of integers representing the number of beats:
```python
from typing import List

def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    """
    Parse a string of music notes in a special ASCII format.
    Each note can be either of: 'o' - whole note, lasts four beats
    'o|' - half note, lasts two beats
    '.|' - quarter note, lasts one beat

    Returns:
        A list of integers corresponding to how many beats each note lasted.
    """
    legend:
    'o' - whole note, lasts four beats
    'o|' - half note, lasts two beats
    '.|' - quarter note, lasts one beat
    """
    # Define the beat lengths
    notes = ['o', 'o|', '.|']

    # Define a mapping of note to beat length
    mapping = {note: beat_length for note, beat_length in zip(notes, notes)}

    # Define the function to split the music string into individual notes
    def split_string(string):
        beats = [0] * 4
        beats[0] = mapping[string[i:i+4]]
        return beats

    # Parse the music string into a list of beats
    return list(split_string(music_string))
```
The function takes a string music_string as input and returns a list of integers. Each integer corresponds to the number of beats that its respective musical note lasted. 

This is a self-contained Python script that efficiently solves the problem of parsing music notes and generates the output in a clear and organized manner.
