Here's the Python script with the `parse_music` function:
```python
from typing import List

def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    notes = {'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '.|': 1}
    notes_list = [notes[symbol] for symbol in music_string.olate()]
   
return notes_list
```
This function takes a string music_string as input and returns a list of integers. It uses a notation from a dictionary to map musical notes to the number of beats they last. The function then iterates through each character in the music_string, and adds the corresponding value from the notes dictionary. 

This function is self-contained and effectively solves the problem of parsing music notes and returns the number of beats corresponding to each character in the input string.
