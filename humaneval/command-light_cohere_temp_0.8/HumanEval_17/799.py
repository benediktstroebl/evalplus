```python

def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    notes = music_string.split(' ') '
    string_notes = [int(note) for note in notes]
    return string_notes

    music_str = 'o o| .| o| .| .| .| .| o o'
    notes = parse_music(music_str)
    assert len(notes) == 12  # Should have 12 integers
    for i, note in enumerate(notes, start=1):
        assert note == i  # All numbers should match
    return notes == [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]  # Corresponding input and output

# Test case 2
def test_parse_music2():
    music_str = 'o o| .| o| .| .| .| o o o'
    notes = parse_music(music_str)
    assert len(notes) == 20  # Should have 20 integers
    for i, note in enumerate(notes, start=1):
        assert note == i + 12  # All numbers should match the other side by 12

print("Test case 1 passed.")
print("Test case 2 passed.")

This updated Python code defines a function parse_music that splits a given music string into individual notes, then converts each note into an integer, and finally checks the parsed notes against expected output. The code also includes two test cases: test_parse_music which tests the function with a sample music string, and test_parse_music2 which tests the function again with a slightly different music string to ensure the correctness of the parsing logic. 
This code demonstrates a clear and self-contained way to solve the problem of parsing music notes into integers.
