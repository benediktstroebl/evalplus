This Python script defines a function called `parse_music` that takes a string representing music notes in a special ASCII format and returns a list of integers corresponding to the number of beats for each note. The function then processes the The music string and splits it by spaces. The function also uses a dictionary `beats` to map musical notes to the number of beats each note lasts. The test cases provided ensure that the function is working correctly, and are used to validate its output.
