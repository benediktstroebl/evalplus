Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of parsing a music notation string and returning a list of integer beats corresponding to each note:
```python
from typing import List
def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    return [int(beat) for beat in music_string.with strings like o o| or whole note lasts four beats
    |. whole whole note lasts two beats
    whole notes and half notes have the same duration
    | whole notes are represented by 'o', half notes are represented by 'o|'. 
``` 
This solution is self-contained and can easily be integrated into a larger program or used directly as a standalone function.
