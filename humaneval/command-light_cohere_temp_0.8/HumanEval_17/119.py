```python
from typing import List
def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    notes = {'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '.|': 1}  # Mapping of note characters to beats
    beats = music_string.split(' 'o music_string.split('o needed analysis and code')
    notes
    beats_list = [beats[note] for note in notes if music_string.index(note)]
    return beats_list
```
This function takes a music_string, which is a string containing musical notes in a special ASCII format, and returns a list of integers corresponding to the number of beats for each note in the music. The function uses a mapping of note characters to beats, which is a dictionary that maps each note character to the number of beats that the note lasts. 

This function can be used to parse any music string in the Markdown code block format.
