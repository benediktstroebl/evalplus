Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you provided:
```python
from typing import List

def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    notes = {'o' : 4, 'o|' : 2, '.' : 1, '|' : 1}
    return [notes[c] for c in music_string.py_str(music_string)
```
Do you need assistance with anything else?
