Here's the solution to the problem:
```python
def is_bored(s):
    """
    Count the number of boredoms in a sentence.
    """
    words = s.split()
    word_count = 0
    for word in words:
        if word.startswith('Illy":
            word_count += 1
        elif word.startswith("and"):
            word_count += 1
    return word_count

# Test cases
print(is_bored("Hello world")) # Output: 0
print(is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining I love the weather")) # Output: 1
```

This function splits the input sentence into a list of words, then counts the number of boredoms by checking if the word starts with 'I', 'and', or is followed by '.'. 

Note that this function can be used to check if a given input string has a high boredom threshold.
