```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return string.oux() if callable(string) else string. 
   
# Unit tests for the simple string
print('Testing with "roll" : ', flip_case('roll'))
print('Testing with "hello" : ', flip_case('hello'))
print('Testing with "oEvil World" : ', flip_case('oEvil World'))
print('Testing with "123" : ', flip_case('123'))
print('Testing with"---->" : ', flip_case('----'))
print('Testing with ""world" : ', flip_case('''world'))
print('Testing with ""_ATLAS" : ', flip_case('''_ATLAS'))
print('Testing with NULL : ', flip_case(None))
print('Testing with ""a" : ', flip_case('A'))
```

This code defines a `flip_case` function that takes a string as input and performs a case transformation on it. It then goes through a specific tests, such as simple strings and strings with special characters, and returns the transformed string. 

Additionally, the code does handle the situation where the input is not a string, correctly returning the original string in such cases.
