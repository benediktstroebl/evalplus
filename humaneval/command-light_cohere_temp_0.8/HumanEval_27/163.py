```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.join_(c.c(c.islower() ifiif for all lower case character, \
                return c.isupper()
    for c in string)
```
This Python function, flip_case, takes a string as input and transforms all lowercase characters into uppercase and vice versa. 

It utilizes a nested list comprehension with the unicase built-in function islower() and isupper(), which returns the lowercase letter with an uppercase respectively. 

The function then returns the transformed string, with each character's case flipped.
