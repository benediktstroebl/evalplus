```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.joinceto_upper()string.cmap({'a'.ord({c}, lambda: c.='lower())
   ..inp to uppercase, c->'lower()')

```

This script defines a function `flip_case` that takes a string as input and returns a new string with the characters flipped from lowercase to uppercase. The function uses the same built-in `cmap` function to generate the new string.

This script follows the Single Responsibility Principle by separating the logic for converting characters into a single output. It is self-contained and focused on solving the problem of flipping characters in a string. This way of writing clean and maintainable code.
