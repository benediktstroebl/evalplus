Here's the provided Python code:
```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return string.test_string = "hello"
    assert flip_case(test_string) == "HELLO"

```

This code defines a function `flip_case` that takes a string as input and returns the modified string with the case of characters flipped. The test_string is set to the value "hello" and the function is called with this string. The assert statement checks if the output of the function is equal to the expected string "HELLO".
