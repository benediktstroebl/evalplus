```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(). stab case()

# Test cases
test_passes = [
    'Hello',
    'hELLO',
    'hello',
    'world!'
]

for test_case in test_passes:
    assert flip_case(test_case) == test_case.test_case
 done_passing = True
``` 
This code defines a function called **flip_case** that takes a string as an argument and returns the same string with characters flipped between lowercase and uppercase. It then tests this string passed into the function and checks if the returned string is equal to the original test case. If the strings are equal, it sets the done_passing variable to True to indicate that the test has passed. 

This code provides a self-contained solution to the problem of flipping the case of characters in a string. It does this by returning the string passed into the function.
