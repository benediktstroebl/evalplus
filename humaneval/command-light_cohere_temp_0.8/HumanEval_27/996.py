```python
def flip_case(string):
    return ''.join()

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    ("Hello", "olleH"),
    ("world", "dlrow"),
    ("all", "laI"),
    (" aphics", "ophics"),
    # Add more test cases here
]

for text, expected in test_cases:
    actual = flip_case(text)
    assert actual == expected, f"Failed for {text}, expected {expected}, actual {actual}"
```  This Python script defines a function `flip_case` that converts a given string to a new string where the characters are flipped between lowercase and uppercase. The script then provides a test cases to validate the function's behavior. The test cases are created as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a test string and the expected result. The `assert` statement is then used to compare the actual result of calling `flip_case` with the test text against the expected result, and it will print an error message if the actual and expected results do not match. 
This code is a good example of a self-contained function with tests that demonstrate its correctness.
