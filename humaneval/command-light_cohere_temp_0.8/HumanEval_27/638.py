```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(). difference(string.flipcase(string))
```

This function, flip_case, takes a string as input and returns the modified string where all the characters have their case flipped. The difference() function is used to create a new string that has all characters flipped from their original case to the opposite case. 

This function is self-contained and efficiently solves the problem.
