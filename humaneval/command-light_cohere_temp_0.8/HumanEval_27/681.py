Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that flips the case of a given string:
```python
def flip_case(string):
    return string.all_lower() if string.

# Example a string to lowercase
print(flip_case('Hello'))
# Expected Output: hELLo

# Test Case 1: String is not a valid input
try:
    flip_case('A')
except ValueError:
    print('Test case 1 failed')

# Test Case 2: Output is a string
print(flip_case('hello'))

# Test Case 3: Output is the original string
print(flip_case('hello world'))
``` 
This script defines a function **flip_case** that takes a string as input and flips the case of characters. The output of the strings are also flipped accordingly. The code also includes test cases to ensure the correctness of the function.
