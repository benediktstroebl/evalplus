```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(). value_case(string, 'Hello')  # ['HELLO']
```
This Python function, flip_case, takes a string as input and transforms the case of its characters. It utilizes a string's value method to modify the characters to their corresponding case. 

The value method takes an iterable of characters and a string as arguments, and returns a new string where the characters of the iterable are in the corresponding case. 

The function then returns the transformed string.
