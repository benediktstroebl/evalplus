Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you described:
```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    """
    For a given string, flip lowercase characters to uppercase and vice versa.
    """
    string = 'HELLO'
    return string. flipcase('H') # testing on strings
```
Do you need help with anything else?
