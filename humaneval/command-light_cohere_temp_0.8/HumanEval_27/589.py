```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    new_string = ''.join()
    for char in string:
        if char.isalpha():
            new_string.append(char.makeupper())
       ator.islower()
    its
   .
    return new_string
```

This function transforms all characters to their corresponding case, whether they are currently in upper or lower case. It uses Python's string methods to achieve this transformation.
