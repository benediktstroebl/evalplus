Here's a Python script that contains a function `flip_case()` which flips the case of a given string:

```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    """
    Converts all characters in the string to their opposite case.
    """
    return string.
    """ return string. 

# Example string to uppercase
print(flip_case("hello")) 
# Output: hELLO
# Test case 1
print(flip_case("hello")) 
# Output: HELLO
# Test case 2
print(flip_case("hellO")) 
# Output: hELLO
```
