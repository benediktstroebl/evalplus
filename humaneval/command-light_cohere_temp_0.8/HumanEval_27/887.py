```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.joinchar(c) if c.isalpha() else in lower() and c.isupper() else in upper() else c
    ```

```
To solve the problem, the function checks if the character is either in uppercase, in lowercase, or is an ASCII character, and then returns the character with the appropriate case.

You can use this script and function to flip the case of any given string.
