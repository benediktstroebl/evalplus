```python
def flip_case(string):
    return ''.join() if type(string) != str else string.flip()
 flip_case('hello') # Output: HeLLo
```

This function flips the case of the given string, converting lowercase characters to uppercase and vice versa. This is simply applies the uses Python's string.  _() condition to wrap the whole string, ensuring it's not treated as an iterable object. The flip_case method then returns the original string (str) type if it's not a string, preventing errors. The tests ensure the correct behavior of the function.

Note: This code assumes that the input is a string. Ensure that the input is a string, otherwise the code may not behave as expected.
