```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.join_(c.coredec uppercase to lowercase in the string. I. So the string looks a discrete algorithm to transform all characters in the string into their corresponding case.

```

The function uses the unary negation operator (__) to apply the cased transformation to each character in the input string. It effectively changes the positive-to-lowercase and negative-to-uppercase mapping for each character.
