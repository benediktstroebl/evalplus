Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function flip_case that transforms a given string, it flips lowercase characters to uppercase and vice versa.

```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    """
    Applies case-flipping to each character in the input string.
    """
    Python copy.c++ string, The same character in the string, to its corresponding case (either lowercase or uppercase).
    Returns the modified string.
""" 
    return string.c_case('hello') 

```
