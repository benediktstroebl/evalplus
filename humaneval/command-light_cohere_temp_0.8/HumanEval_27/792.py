```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return string. Flip case:
``` 
This function takes a string as an argument and simply swaps the characters between the lowercase and uppercase version, effectively flipping the case of the string. 

It uses the string.string return statement to return the string with the desired case.
