Here's the self-contained Python script that solves the problem of flipping the case of characters in a given string:
```python
def flip_case(string):
    return ''.join_case(string)

def test_flip_case():
    assert flip_case('Hello') == 'olleH'
    assert flip_case('HEllO') == 'hello'
    assert flip_case('World') == 'orld'
    assert flip_case('!!!!!') == '????'
    assert flip_case('  hello world') == 'o helloworld'

def __starting_code():
    test_flip_case()
__starting_code()
```
This script defines a function `flip_case` that takes a string as input and returns a new string with the case of characters flipped. It also includes a test function `test_flip_case` that contains several assertions to verify the correctness of the `flip_case` function. The last function is defined at the top of the script, ensuring that it is self-contained and can be executed independently.
