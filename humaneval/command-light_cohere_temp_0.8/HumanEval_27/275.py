Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem you have described:
```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return string.flip(str.case) if string else contains all uppercase
```

The function flip_case takes a string as input and uses the `str.flip()` method to swap the case of the characters in the string. This is a returned string will have the characters flipped.
