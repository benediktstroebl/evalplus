```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.join() if not string else string.flip()
flip()
# tests
``` 
This code creates a function `flip_case` that takes a string as input and returns a string after applying the flip case transformation. The code uses the string method to create a string with an empty character at the end, this is a self-contained way to create the string and pass the test at the same time.
