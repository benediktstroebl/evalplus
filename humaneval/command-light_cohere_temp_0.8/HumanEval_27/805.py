```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    new_str = ""
    for char in string:
        if char.isalpha():  #.to by char.isupper(): new_a char
        new_str += char.
    return new_str
``` 
This function takes a string as input and iterates through each character. It checks if the string character is in uppercase using the isalpha() function. If it's true, the character is converted to lowercase using the char. Then, it's appended to the new_str variable.
