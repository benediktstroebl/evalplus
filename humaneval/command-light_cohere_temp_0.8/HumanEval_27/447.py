```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    new_str = ''.join()
    for char in string:
        if char.isalpha():
            new_str.append(char.swapc())
        an only char.isupper()
        is creating a new case where the character is flipped.
    return new_str
```
Do you need assistance with anything else?
