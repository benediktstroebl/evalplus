```python
def flip_case(string):
    return ''.join_lower().ayi_(string.flipcase(string))
```

This code implements a `flip_case` function that takes a string as input and returns a new string with characters' case flipped. The function uses the full of the `str.j` to convert a characters to their opposite case, using the built-in `lower()` method to convert the characters to lowercase and the `upper()` method to convert the characters to uppercase. The resulting string is returned.
