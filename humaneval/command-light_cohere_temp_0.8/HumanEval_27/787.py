```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(''.join(char.isupper(c) if c.islower(c) else c.isupper(c) if c! areupper() and. [...]
    return c.lower() if c.isupper(c) if c.isupper(c))
```
Here is a self-contained Python script that defines and implements the `flip_case` function, which takes a string as an argument and returns the flipped case of the characters in the string. 

This is a common practice in Python to improve code reuslience and reduce code dependencies.
