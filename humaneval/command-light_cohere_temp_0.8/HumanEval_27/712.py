```python
def flip_case(string):
    return ''.join_lowercase(string.test_case())
```
Here's the explanation:
- The function flip_case takes a string as input and uses the join() method with the lowercase alphabet to convert all characters to lowercase. This method is a only way to lowercase all characters in the string. 
- Then test_case() function is a built-in function in Python that returns True if all characters in the string are in lowercase.
- It ensures that the flip_case function correctly transforms the string to lowercase.
