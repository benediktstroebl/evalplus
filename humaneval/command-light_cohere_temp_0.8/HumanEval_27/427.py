Here's the Python script with a self-contained function `flip_case()` that flips the case of a given string:
```python
def flip_case(string):
    return ''.join() if not string or string == string.transform(string.lower())
    ** approached from Python, yet still produces the same result as the original. The code is concise and easier to understand.
