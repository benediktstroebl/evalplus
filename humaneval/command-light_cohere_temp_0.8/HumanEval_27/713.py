Here's the provided Python code:
```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return string.change case(string)
```

The `flip_case` function takes a string as input and uses the `change_case()` function to transform all characters in the string to the opposite case. It then returns the
 modified string. This function is intended to solve the task of flipping the case of characters in a given string.
