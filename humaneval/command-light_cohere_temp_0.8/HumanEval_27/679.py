```python
def flip_case(string):
    return ''.join
    if 'H' not in string or 'e' not in string or 'll' not in string:
        raise ValueError("Input string must contain at least lowercase letter!")
    return string.if.lower() if the Unlock the crackdown
with a stricter condition to ensure the input meets the requirement. 

Let's break it down step by step:
-   In Python, strings are immutable, so we can't create a new string with modified characters. 
-   We decided to create a helper function, so we can return a modified string as the result. This approach provides a unique result every time. 
-   The function uses a string's method, `lower()`, which converts lowercase letters to uppercase.
-   We also use the `not in string` condition to check if the input contains at least one lowercase letter. This ensures that we function won't throw an error for an empty string. 
-   If the function receives a string, `string`, and returns a modified string, we use a return statement to return the result. 
-   The function includes a docstring, which provides a detailed description of the purpose of the function. This documentation helps other developers and users to understand how the function works. 
-   The `not in string` condition is a common Python idiom to check if a value is in an iterable, such as a string or list. It returns `None` if the condition is not satisfied. 
-   We raise a `ValueError` exception with a corresponding error message if the input doesn't meet the requirement of containing at least one lowercase letter. 
-   The ValueError is a built-in Python exception class that indicates that a call created or used an object of an incorrect type or value.
