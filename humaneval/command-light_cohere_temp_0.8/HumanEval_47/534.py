The function median is a straightforward Python function that calculates the median of the elements in a given list. The function raises a error if the list does not contain at least three elements, and the test cases are added to validate the function. The test cases cover a wide range of inputs, including lists with different lengths and elements, and lists with different orders of elements. The function is designed to calculate the median of the elements in the list and return the result.
