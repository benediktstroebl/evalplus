```python
def median(lst):
    n = len(lst)
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return (l[n//2 - 1] + l[n//2]) / 2
    else:
        return l[n//2]

# Test the function with different data
for test in [[-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20], [3, 1, 2, 4, 5], [0.5, -1.8, 'abc']]:

This script defines a function median that computes the median of the elements in a list. For even-length lists, the median is the average of the middle two elements, while for odd-length lists, the median is the middle element. The test section then demonstrates the function with a variety of test inputs and asserts that the output is equal to the expected result. The output is also the sum of the test cases.
