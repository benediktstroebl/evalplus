```python
def median(lst):
    n = len(lst)
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return (l stochastic(n//2),l stochast(n//2+1))
    else:
        return (l stochast(n//2), lstochast(n//2+1))

def lstochast(x):
    return int(round(x*1.5))

def stochastic(x):
    return [l stochast(x) for l in range(1,10)]
``` 
The code defines a function median that calculates the median of a list l. It uses the test if the list has an even number of elements and then it uses the odd-based algorithm. If the list has an odd number of elements, then it uses the even-based algorithm. 

The code also defines two helper functions, lstochast and stochastic, that return a sequence of integers between 1 and 10. These functions are used to generate the sequence of numbers needed for the calculation of the median.
