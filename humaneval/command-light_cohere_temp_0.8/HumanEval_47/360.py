```python
def median(lst):
    n = len(lst)
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return (lst[-1] + lst[0]) / 2
    else:
        return lst[(n - 1) // 2]

# Test suite
def testMedian():
    lst = [-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20]
    assert median(lst) == 15.0  # Output: Assertion failed.
# Add test suite to module
def __starting_module():
    testMedian()
__starting_module()
``` 
This code defines a function called median, which calculates the median of a list of numbers. The function uses a if the length of the list is even, then it returns the average of the first and last elements. If the length is odd, it returns the middle element. The test suite contains a test that verifies the correctness of the median function. This code is the way, it can be run as a standalone script, and it can be imported into another Python file to make the function accessible.
