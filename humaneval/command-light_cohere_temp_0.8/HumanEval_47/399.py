```python
def median(l: list):
    n = len(l)
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return (l[n//2 - 1] + l[n//2]) / 2
    else:
        return l[n//2]
```
The median function computes the median value of the list. It handles the checking the the condition for an odd or even even number of elements. The function works by identifying the median value as the middle value of the two middle numbers when the number of elements is even, or the average of the two middle numbers when the number of elements is odd.

You can test the function by passing different lists as input, and the result should be verified.
