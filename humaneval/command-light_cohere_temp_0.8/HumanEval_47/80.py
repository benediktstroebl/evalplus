```python
def median(l):
    """Return median of elements in the list l."""
    return (len(l) + 1) / 2 * sum((x + i * l[i]) / 2 for i, x in enumerate(l))
```  This code defines a function `median` which calculates the median of a list's elements.  It first takes thea use a loop to select every element from the list and calculate the average of the current element and the average of the element multiplied by its index in the list, and divide by 2.  Finally, the result is the median of the list's elements.
