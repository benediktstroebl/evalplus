```python
def median(l: list):
    """Return median of elements in the list l.
    if len(l) % 2 == 1:
        return l[len(l)//2]
    return (l[len(l)//2 - 1] + l[len(l)//2]) / 2
``` 
This Python code defines a function called median that calculates and returns the median of a list's elements. The function first checks if the list's length is even or odd. If the length is even, it returns the middle element, which is the median. Otherwise, the function returns the average of the two middle elements. 

This implementation efficiently calculates the median using fewer operations and avoids potential bugs that might occur when using a brute-force approach.
