```python
def median(l: list):
    """Return median of elements in the list l.
    if len(l) % 2 == 1:
        return l[len(l) // 2]
    return (l[len(l) // 2 - 1] + l[len(l) // 2]) / 2
``` 
This Python code defines a function `median` that calculates the median of the elements in a list `l`. It takes a parameter `l`, which represents an input list. 

The function checks whether the list has an even number of elements, in which case it returns the median using the formula for the odd case. 

Otherwise, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle elements. 

This self-contained function demonstrates the concept of finding the median in a concise and organized way.
