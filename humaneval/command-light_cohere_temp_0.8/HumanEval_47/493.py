```python
def median(l: list):
    """Return median of elements in the list l.
    Returns the
median of a list of numbers l is the average of the two middle numbers 
    from the sorted list. For example, for list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the sorted list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. 
    The middle numbers are 2 and 3, so the median is (2+3)/2 = 2.5.

    Example dry list to a 3
    return float(l[len(l)//2])
    """
    if len(l) < 3:
        return "Error: Input list must have at least three elements"
    m1, m2 = l[len(l)//2 - 1], l[len(l)//2]
    return float(m1 + m2) / 2
```
This code defines a function median that calculates the median of the elements in a list. It then tests the median by comparing the two middle elements of the sorted list and adding them up then dividing by 2. The function also handles the dry inputs and returns an error message for those inputs.
