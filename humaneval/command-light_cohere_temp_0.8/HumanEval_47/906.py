This Python script defines a function `median` that computes the median of a list's elements. The function uses a formula to calculate the median: the average of the middle two elements of a sorted list.

The `test_median` function has test cases that cover different scenarios, such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with multiple elements. The `test_median_empty` and `test_median_large` functions test the function with an empty list and a large list of numbers, respectively.

The script's tests successfully pass with the provided function.
