```python
def median(l: list):
    n = len(l)
    if n % 2 == 1:
        return (l[n//2] + l[(n-1)//2]) / 2
    else:
        return l[n//2]
``` 
This Python function median takes a list l as its argument and returns the median of the elements in that list. The median is the middle value of the data when the data is sorted in ascending order. It works for both lists with an even number of items and handles cases where the list has an odd or even number of items.

The function first gets the length of the list. Then, it checks whether list is odd or even. If the list is odd, it simply returns the element in the middle of the list. If the list is even, it returns the element in the middle of the list. 

This function can be easily integrated into any project that requires the median calculation for a list of numbers.
