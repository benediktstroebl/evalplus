```python
def median(lst):
    # Sort the list
    lst.sort()
    
    # Take theways a list of numbers:
        a, b = sorted((1, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20))
        assert a == (1 + 3) / 2, "Sorted list is not in sorted order"
        assert b == (4 + 6) / 2, "Sorted list is not in sorted order"
        assert lst == [1, 3, 4, 6, 10, 20], "List is not sorted"
        assert median([3, 4, 5]) == 5, "Failed median calculation"
        assert median([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20]) == 15.0, "Failed median calculation"
```
