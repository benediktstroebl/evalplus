```python
def median(l: list):
    """Return median of elements in the list l."""
    # Sort the list
    l.sort()
    Median is not a built-in function, so we need to sort the list manually.
    return l[sort() == [sorted(l)]
    # The median is the middle element
    i = len(l) // 2
    return l[i]
```
