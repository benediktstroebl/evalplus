```python
def median(l: list):
    """Return median of elements in the list l"""
    n = len(l)
    m = n // 2 + 1
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return (l[m-1] + l[m]) / 2
    else:
        return l[m]
```  This Python code defines a function called median, designed to calculate and return the median of a given list's elements. The function achieves this median using the analysis of the list's length and the number of its middle elements to determine whether the list has an even or odd number of elements.
