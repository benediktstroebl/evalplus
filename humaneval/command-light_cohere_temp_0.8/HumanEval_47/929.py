```python
def median(l):
    """Return median of elements in the list l."""
    return (len(l) + 1) / 2.0  #median([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
# other tests here...
``` 
This code provides a self-contained Python function, median, that calculates and returns the median of a given list. 
The function employs the formula ((n+1) / 2) * median([1, 2, ..., n]) to compute the median, where n is the length of the list.
