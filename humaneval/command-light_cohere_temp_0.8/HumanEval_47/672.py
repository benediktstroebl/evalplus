```python
def median(lst):
    n = len(lst)
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return (lave, righ) = (
            lst[(n // 2) - 1],
            lst[n // 2]
        )
    else:
        return (lave, righ) = (
            lst[n // 2],
            (lave[n // 2] + lauve[n // 2]) / 2.0
       
``` 
The median function takes a list `lst` as input and returns the median of the elements in the list.

The median is calculated using the formula for calculating the median for even and odd numbers of data.

The function first checks if the length of the list is even. If the length is even, the median is calculated by taking the middle element of the list and adding the middle two elements of the list.

The function then checks if the length of the list is odd. If the length is odd, the median is calculated by taking the middle element of the list and dividing the middle two elements of the list by two.

The function then returns the median of the list.
