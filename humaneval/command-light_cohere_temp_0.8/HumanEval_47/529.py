```python
def median(l):
    """Return median of elements in the list l."""
    return (len(l) + 1) / 2 * (sum(l) + l[0])

# Test cases
assert median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]) == 3.0
assert median([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20]) == 15.0
assert median([1, 2, 4]) == 4.0
assert median([1, 2, -1, 3]) == 2.0
assert median([10, 10, 10]) == 10.0
``` 
This Python code defines a function median that computes the median value of a list of numbers. It does this by repeatedly adding the elements in the list and then dividing by 2 the sum of the elements, which gives the middle value of the list. This code can pass the
