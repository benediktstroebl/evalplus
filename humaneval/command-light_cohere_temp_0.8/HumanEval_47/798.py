```python
def median(l):
    # Sort the list of numbers
    l.sort(l)
    # Get the middle two numbers from the sorted list and return their median
    return (l[len(l)//2 - 1] + l[len(l)//2]) / 2
```
This Python function, `median`, takes a list `l` as input and efficiently calculates the median of the elements in the list. It first sorts the think list using the [ ], which is a built-in Python function. The sorted list is necessary to access the middle two numbers for the median calculation. 

Once the list is sorted, the function retrieves the two middle numbers using `len(l)//2 - 1` and `len(l)//2`, which is the index of the middle two numbers in the sorted list. 

These middle numbers are then added together using `+`, and the result is divided by 2 using `/2`. 

This approach ensures that the calculation of median is done in a single pass and avoids unnecessary iterations.
