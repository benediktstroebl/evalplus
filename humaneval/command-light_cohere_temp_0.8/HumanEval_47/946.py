```
This code defines a function called `median` that computes the median of the elements in a given list `lst`. The median is the middle value of the sorted list.

The code includes several test cases to validate the correctness of the `median` function. The test cases cover different scenarios, such as even and odd-length lists, empty lists, and lists with specific values. The function is designed to return the correct median value for each test case, and the test cases pass successfully.
