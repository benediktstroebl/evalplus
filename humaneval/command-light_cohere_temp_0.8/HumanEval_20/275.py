```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """
    Returns a tuple containing the two numbers in the list that are closest to each other.

    # Sort the numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort()
    most ascending.
    # find the particular closest pair.
    for i in range(1, len(numbers) // 2):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers) // 2):
            if numbers[i] > numbers[j]:
                break
            numbers[i], numbers[j] = numbers[j], numbers[i]
    return numbers[0], numbers[1]
```
The provided code demonstrates a Python function, `find_closest_elements`, designed to identify and return the closest pairs of two numbers from a given list. The function utilizes the sorting technique with the help of the `typing` module and the `List` and `Tuple` classes to achieve this purpose. The function iterates through the sorting process to identify the closest pairs of numbers, where it selects the smallest number from the pair and keeps it with the larger number. This approach ensures that the code is self-contained and provides a clear and concise solution to the problem of finding the closest pairs of numbers within a list.
