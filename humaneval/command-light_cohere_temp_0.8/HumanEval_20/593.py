Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function to solve the problem you provided:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """ From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).
    ```

The function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a tuple of two floats, with the two closest elements to each other, in order of their relationship. 

You can use this function to solve your problem by passing in the appropriate list of numbers.
