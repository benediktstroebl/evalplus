Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # Initialize the variables to store the closest elements and their relation.
    closest1, closest2 = float('inf'), 0.0

    # Sort the0 function to find the smallest element in the list
    for num in numbers:
        if closest < num:
            closest = num
        closest2 = num
        # Sort the two closest elements and return them in order
        if closest2 < closest:
            closest = closest2
        else:
            closest2 = closest2
        return closest, closest2

```
This code defines a function **find_closest_elements** that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a tuple with the two closest elements and their relationship. The function sorts the important pairs of elements in the list and returns the smallest one first, and the largest one second. This allows the for correct results when the user passes a list of elements.
