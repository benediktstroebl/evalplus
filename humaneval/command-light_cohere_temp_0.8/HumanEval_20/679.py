```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """ Selects and returns two numbers from the list that are closest to each other and returns them in order (smaller number, larger number)"""
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the smallest and the largest number in the list
    smallest = float('inf')
    largest = float('-inf')

    # Iterate over the list and update the smallest and largest number
    for num in numbers:
        if num < smallest:
            smallest = num
        if num > largest:
            largest = num

    # Return the smallest and the largest number
    return smallest, largest
```
This Python code defines a function called find_closest_elements that takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and aims to select and return two numbers from the list that are the closest to each other. The function initializes variables to keep track of the smallest and the largest number in the list using the floats 'inf' and '-inf' which represent the largest and smallest values in a float respectively. The function then iterates over the numbers in the list and updates the smallest and largest values accordingly. Finally, the function returns the smallest and largest values and returns a tuple containing both of them in the correct order.
