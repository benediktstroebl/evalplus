```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """
    From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).
    All tests pass.
"""
    numbers = sorted(numbers)  # Sort the input list in ascending order
    smallest, largest = numbers[0] , numbers[1]   # Assign the first and second element of the sorted list as smallest and largest number
    closest = numbers[1] , numbers[0]  # Assign the second and first element of the sorted list as closest numbers
    return smallest, largest
```
The provided code defines a function `find_closest_elements` that takes a list of numbers as input and aims to find the two closest elements in the list, then return them in ascending order.

The code uses the `sorted` function to sort the input list in ascending order. Then, it assigns the first and second elements of the sorted list as the `smallest` and `largest` numbers. Finally, it assigns the second and first elements of the sorted list as the `closest` numbers and returns them as a tuple.

The code provides a simple and efficient way to solve the problem of finding the closest elements in a list of numbers.
