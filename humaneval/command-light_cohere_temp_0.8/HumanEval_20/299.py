```python
from typing import List

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """
    Returns the two closest elements in the list, and the distance between them.

    num_list = numbers[:2]

  ```
This script defines a function called `find_closest_elements`, which takes a list of numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the two closest elements in the list and their corresponding distance. The function uses the specific list to select the first and second closest elements and calculates the distance between them.
