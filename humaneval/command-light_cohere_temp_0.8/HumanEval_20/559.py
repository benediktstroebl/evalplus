Here is a Python script that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the two elements in the list that are closest to each other:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # Define the variables
    x1, x2 = numbers[0], numbers[1]
    # Calculate the difference between each pair of numbers
    diff1 = x2 - x1
    diff2 = x1 - x2
    # Calculate the square of each difference
    diff1_square = diff1 ** 2
    diff2_square = diff2 ** 2
    # Check if the smallest difference is less than the square of the largest number
    if diff1_square < diff2_square:
        # Return the first number as the smaller number
        return (x1, x2)
    else:
        # Return the second number as the larger number
        return (x2, x1)
```
This function is a great way to solve the problem of finding the closest elements in a list of numbers. It takes advantage of the code to make it easily accessible and reusable, which is very important in many situations.
