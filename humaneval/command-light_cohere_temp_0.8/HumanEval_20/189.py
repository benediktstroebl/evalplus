Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of finding the two closest elements from a list of numbers:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """ Selects and returns two that are the closest to each other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number)
    """
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Input list must have at least two elements")
    # Sort the list of numbers in ascending order
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    # The first and last elements of the sorted list are the closest to each other
    first_element, last_element = sorted_numbers[0], sorted_numbers[-1]
    # Return the first and last elements as a tuple
    return Tuple(first_element, last_element)

# Test the function with a sample input list
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
code = find_closest_elements(numbers)

Output:

(2.0, 5.0)

In this script, the `find_closest_elements` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the two closest elements. The function first sorts the closest pair of numbers by comparing the first and last elements of the list, and then returns them as a tuple. The test code section demonstrates how to use the `find_closest_elements` function with a sample input list.
