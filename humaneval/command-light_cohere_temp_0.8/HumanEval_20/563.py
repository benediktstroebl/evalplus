The provided code demonstrates the find_closest_elements() function, which aims to find the two closest elements in a given list of numbers. It utilizes the typing module to create type hints for the function parameters and returns a tuple with the two closest elements. The code also includes a basic input validation to ensure the input list has at least two elements. The function then calculates the min and max numbers in the list, and iterates through the list to find the smallest and largest numbers, updating the min and max variables accordingly. Finally, the function returns the smallest and largest numbers as a tuple.
