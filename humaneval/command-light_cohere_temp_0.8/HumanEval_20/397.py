The provided Python script defines a function `find_closest_elements` that aims to find and return the closest elements from a given list of numbers. It uses a technique where it first checks if the list has less than two elements, and raises an error if that condition is met. Then, it initializes two variables, `a` and `b`, with the first and last elements of the list, respectively. After that, it enters a loop that continuously calculates the squared distance between `a` and `b` and compares it with the current distance. If the new distance is smaller than the previous one, it updates `a` and `b`. The final returned values are the closest elements in the order of smaller to larger numbers.

The script also contains three test functions: `test_find_closest_elements`, `test_find_closest_elements_order`, and `test_find_closest_elements_distance`. These functions demonstrate how to use the `find_closest_elements` function to solve the problem and pass the corresponding tests.
