Here's a Python code snippet that solves the problem of finding the two closest elements in a list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # Sort the list of numbers in ascending order.
    numbers.sort()
   -
   
sorted_numbers = Tuple(numbers[:-len(numbers) // 2])
    return sorted_numbers
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a tuple of two closest elements in the list, along with their order of proximity. The function sorts the list of numbers in ascending order using the sorted() function. It then creates a tuple called sorted_numbers that contains the first two elements of the sorted list, and then returns this tuple.
