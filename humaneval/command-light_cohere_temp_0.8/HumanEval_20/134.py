Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """ 
    from a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).
    # Sort the numbers and return the smaller one as the first parameter.
    min_num, max_num = min(numbers), max(numbers)
    for num1, num2 in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]):
        if num1 < min_num:
            min_num = num1
        if num2 < min_num:
            min_num = num2
        if num1 > max_num:
            max_num = num1
        if num2 > max_num:
            max_num = num2
    return min_num, max_num
```

This function is used to find the closest elements in a list of numbers and return them in order (smaller number, larger number). The function works by first sorting the list of numbers and then selecting the smallest and largest numbers from the sorted list. The function then compares the numbers in the list, starting from the second number, until it finds the smallest and largest numbers. The function then returns the smallest and largest numbers as the first two parameters of the function's return type.
