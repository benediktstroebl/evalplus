```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # initialize a tuple of two closest elements
    closest = (numbers[0], min(numbers[1:]))
    
    # initialize a tuple of two distances, sorted by descending order
    distances = [min(numbers[0:]),), max(numbers[1:]))]
    return distances[0], distances[1]
```
This Python code defines a function called `find_closest_elements`, designed to determine and return the closest pair of elements from a given list of numbers. The function uses the `List[float]` as input, which represents a list of numerical values. 

The function initializes a tuple called `closest` that contains the first element from the input list (`numbers[0]`) and the minimum value of the remaining elements in the list (`min(numbers[1:])`). This ensures that the elements that are closest to each other are selected. 

It also initializes a tuple called `distances` that contains the minimum and maximum values of the elements in the list, sorted in descending order. The function then returns the `distances[0]` and `distances[1]`, which contain the two smallest and largest values respectively. 

The result is a tuple of two floats, which represent the distances between the closest elements in the list. The function effectively finds the minimum and maximum values from the list and returns them in that order, as the smallest and largest values are expected to be the closest elements.
