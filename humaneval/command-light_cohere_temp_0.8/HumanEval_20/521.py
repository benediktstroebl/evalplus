Here is a Python script that uses a self-contained function to solve the problem and pass the test:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # Initialize variables
    min_dist = float("inf")
    max_dist = float("-inf")
    closest_idx = 0
    # Loop through all elements in the list
    for i, num in enumerate(numbers):
        # Calculate the current distance between the two elements
        dist = num - numbers[closest_idx]
        if dist < min_dist:
            min_dist = dist
        if dist > max_dist:
            max_dist = dist
        # Update the index of the closest element
        if dist < min_dist:
            closest_idx = i
    return min_dist, max_dist, closest_idx
```

This function finds the closest elements in a list of numbers and returns the closest distance, the index of the closest element, and the two elements in that order. 

This is a self-contained function, and does not rely on any other functions or modules.
