    for n in numbers:

The provided code defines a function called find_closest_elements that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the two closest numbers in the list along with their relative order. The function first sorts the common keys in the list and assigns them to the variables smallest and largest. The for loop then iterates through the list and checks if the current number is smaller than the smallest value, or if it is larger than the largest value. If the condition is met, the break statement is executed. If the loop completes without any break, it means that the current number is the smallest or the largest number, and the break statement ensures that the function returns the correct result. The function uses thex key function to sort the list, and then it iterates through the sorted list to find the smallest and largest values. The function initializes two variables to represent the smallest and largest values, and then it iterates through the list to update these variables based on the current number.
