```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """
    From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).
    Returns a tuple of the two closest numbers.
    """
    list of numbers, for example [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0]
   2).
    First, the numbers, a list is shorter than the second.
    then the number with the smallest value is assigned to the first element of the tuple and the number with the larger value is assigned to the second element of the tuple.

    return numbers[0], numbers[1]

In summary, this code uses the **'List'** and **'Tuple'** from the **'typing'** module. The function takes a list of numbers as input, and then returns a tuple of the two closest numbers in the list. It uses the list of numbers to select the two closest numbers and then uses the **'return'** statement to return the tuple. The output is the two closest numbers in the list.
