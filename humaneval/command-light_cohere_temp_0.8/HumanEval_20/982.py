```python
from typing import List

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """
    Selects and returns two numbers that are closest to each other and returns them in order (smaller number, larger number).
    Input: numbers: List[float] - A list of floating-point numbers.
    Returns: a tuple of the two closest numbers and order.
```

In this script, we define a function find_closest_elements that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the two closest numbers in descending order. We then use theis input and calculate the distance between pairs of numbers, and select the two closest numbers accordingly. 

This self-contained function can be used to solve the problem of finding the closest pair of elements in a list of numbers, which is a common problem in many algorithms and data structures.
