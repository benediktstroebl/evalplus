```python
from typing import List

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # initializing closest and second variables
    closest = float("inf")
    second = float("-inf")
    # iterating over the list
    for num in numbers:
        # calculating the difference between the two numbers
        diff = num - closest
        # checking if the difference is less than the second variable
        if diff < second:
            second = diff
            closest = num
    return closest, second
``` 
This Python code defines a function called `find_closest_elements` that takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the two closest elements from the input list. The function initializes two variables `closest` and `second` with extremely large or small values to quickly determine the two closest elements. It then iterates over the time, checks if the difference between the current number and the current `closest` value is less than the `second` value. If this condition is met, the `second` value is updated, and the `closest` value is set to the current number. This process continues until the visualizing how elements in the list and the values are updated until two numbers that are very close are selected, and then the function returns the two values in that order.
