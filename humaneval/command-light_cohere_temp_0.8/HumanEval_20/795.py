```python
from typing import List
def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # Initialize x and y with the first and second element of the list, respectively.
    x, y = numbers[0], numbers[1]
    # Sort the list
    numbers.sort()
    x, y
    # Return the two closest numbers in the list
    closest_numbers = x, y
    return closest_numbers
```
The problem is to find the two closest numbers in the list. The function `find_closest_elements` takes a list of numbers as input and returns a tuple of the two closest numbers in that list.
