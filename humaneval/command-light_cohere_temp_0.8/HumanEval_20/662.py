Here is a Python script that defines a self-contained function to solve the problem of finding the closest pair of elements in a list:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # initializing two variables to hold the closest elements and their respective distances
    closest1 = float("inf")
    closest2 = float("inf")
    # loop to compare each pair of elements and update the closest variables
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            # calculate the distance between the current elements
            num1 = numbers[i]
            num2 = numbers[j]
            distance = (num1 - num2) ** 2
            # check if the distance is less than the current closest distance for either element
            if distance < closest1 or distance < closest2:
                closest1 = min(distance, closest1)
                closest2 = min(distance, closest2)
            # if the current pair is closer than the other, update the closest variables
            if distance < closest1:
                closest1 = num2
            if distance < closest2:
                closest2 = num2
    # return the two closest elements and their respective distances
    return closest1, closest2
```

This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a tuple of the two closest elements along with their respective distances. The function uses two nested loops to compare each pair of elements in the list and updates the variables that hold the closest elements and their respective distances. The function also uses the specific comparison operators to determine the closest elements, as well as a condition to update the closest variables.

This code is self-contained and does not require any external modules or functions to be used.
