```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # Set the first and last elements as the closest pair
    a, b = numbers[0], numbers[-1]
    while len(numbers) > 1:
        a, b = min(a, b), max(a, b)
        if a == b:
            break
    return a, b

# Example usage
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0]
result = find_closest_elements(numbers)
```

This function takes a list of numbers and aims to return a pair of the closest elements in the list. The function uses a "two-pointer" approach to locate the first and last elements in the list, and then iterates through the list, comparing the two elements and updating the "distance" variable until the two elements are the same. 

The function then returns the pair of elements that are the closest to each other and in order of their smaller value.
