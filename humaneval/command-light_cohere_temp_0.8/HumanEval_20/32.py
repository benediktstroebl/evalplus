Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of finding the closest elements in a list of numbers:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """
    From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).
    We use the method of sorting two elements with the smallest value first, and if they are equal, the second element is selected.
    >
    list of numbers first, then create a tuple with the two closest elements.
    Return the tuple (smallest, largest)
"""

You can use this function in a markdown code block to find the closest elements in a list of numbers.
