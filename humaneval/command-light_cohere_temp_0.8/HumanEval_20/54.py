```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # Return two closest elements and the corresponding distances
    closest1 = min(numbers)
    closest2 = max(numbers)
    distance1 = numbers[0] - closest1
    distance2 = numbers[1] - closest2
    return closest1, distance1, closest2, distance2

# Test the function with some examples
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2]

result = find_closest_elements(numbers)
print(result)
```
The provided code defines a function called find_closest_elements that takes a list of numbers as input and aims to find the two closest elements and their corresponding distances. The function uses the min() and max() functions to select the smallest and largest numbers from the input list, respectively. Then, it calculates the difference between the two numbers and the current closest element, which is stored in the variables distance1 and distance2, respectively. The function then returns the smallest number, the largest number, and the two values and their corresponding distances.

The test code demonstrates the usage of the find_closest_elements function by passing a list of numbers [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2] as arguments, and it prints the result, which is a tuple containing the two closest elements and their corresponding distances.

It selects [2.0, 1.0] as the0 result.
