This Python code defines a function called `find_closest_elements` that aims to find and return the indices of the two elements in a list that are the closest to each other. 

The function takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and uses a custom sorting algorithm to find the two closest elements. 

It first checks if the list has at least two elements, and raises a `ValueError` if not. It then sorts the the list based on the value of the first element. 

After sorting, it finds the indices of the two closest elements. It then returns these indices in descending order. 

This function can be useful for tasks such as finding the closest elements in a list of data points, or finding pairs of elements that have the smallest and largest values in a list.
