```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # Select the first two elements that are closest to each other.
    # Sort the numbers in ascending order and get the first two elements.
    # Check if the value of the first element is greater than the second element
    first = numbers[0]
    second = numbers[1]
    if first > second:
        second = numbers[0]
        first = numbers[1]
    # Return the two elements in descending order
    return first, second

# Test
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 2]

result = find_closest_elements(numbers)
print(result)
```
This Python code defines a function named find_closest_elements that takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and aims to find the closest pair of elements within the list. The function achieves this goal by first sorting the input list of numbers in ascending order using the sorted() method. It then selects the element from the beginning as the first element and the second element as the second element. The function compares the elements to determine which is the larger value. Finally, it returns the two elements in descending order and stores them in a tuple.

The code then tests the find_closest_elements function with a sample list of numbers and prints the resulting tuple that contains the two closest elements.
