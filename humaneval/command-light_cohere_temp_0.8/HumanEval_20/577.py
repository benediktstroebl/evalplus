```python

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """ Returns the closest two elements in the list and their order. This function takes a maximum list of numbers, where each element is a float and the length must be at least two. It returns a the list of two floats that are the closest to each other in the list. This function uses the strategy to find the minimum distance between the two elements, then selects the smaller element from the list and returns it with the larger element, and finally returns the two elements in order of the smaller element first. This is use the approach to solve this problem by using the find_closest_elements function.  """
 function takes in a list of numbers as input and returns a tuple of two floats that are the closest to each other in the list. 

This function uses the provided library 'typing' for better type hinting and future functionality.
