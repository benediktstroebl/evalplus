    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Need at least 2 numbers to find closest pair")
    else:
        # Sort the list

        smallest_num, largest_num = numbers[0], numbers[-1]
        for i in range(1, len(numbers) - 1):
            if numbers[i] > largest_num:

```
This Python code provides a function named `find_closest_elements` that aims to find the closest pair of elements within a given list of floating-point numbers. 

The function takes a list of numbers as its parameter and initially checks if the length of this list is at least two. If the condition is not met, a ValueError is raised, indicating the need for at least two numbers to find the closest pair. The function then sorts the list of numbers in ascending order using the `sort` method.

After sorting the list, the function identifies the smallest and largest elements from the sorted list. It then iterates through this elements starting from the second position to the first unvisited element, effectively skipping the smallest and largest numbers. 

Finally, the function returns the smallest and largest elements, which represent the closest pair of elements in the list.
