```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """
    Selects and returns two elements from the list that are the closest to each other. Returns the elements in order (smaller number, larger number).
    # Test the function using a list of numbers, with at least two elements.
"""
    return numbers[0][0] if len(numbers)==2 else numbers[0] if numbers[0]<numbers[1] else numbers[1] if numbers[1]<numbers[0] else numbers[0][1]
```
This function utilizes the elements of a list of numbers to determine the two elements that are closest to each other. It returns a result in the order of smaller to larger numbers.
