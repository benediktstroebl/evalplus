Here is the Python script with the self-contained function:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """ Selects and returns two elements from the input list that are the closest to each other.

    # Sort the sorting function to make the numbers be in ascending order.
    numbers.sort()
    hot gun game the IN fashion.
    # Take two two elements in the input list.
```

The function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a tuple of two closest elements in the list, along with their relative order.
