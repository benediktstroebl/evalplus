```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # Select the two closest elements in the list
    _, = sorted((-num1, -num2) for num1, num2 in zip(numbers)))
    return (*_,)

# Test cases
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2]

print(find_closest_elements(numbers))

``` 
The script defines a function find_closest_elements that takes in a list of numbers and returns a tuple containing the two closest numbers in the list, along with a comparison of how close they are to each other. The script then uses the sorted() function to create a sorted list of the numbers and extracts the two closest numbers from the list, using the tuple unpacking feature of the tuple.

The test case then calls the function with a list of numbers and prints out the result. The expected output is a tuple of the two closest numbers, with a comparison of how close they are to each other.
