```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # Initialize the variables
    min_dist = float("inf")
    closest_num = float("inf")
    closest_index = None

    # Search for the closest element in the list based on the current smaller value
    for index, num in enumerate(numbers):
        current_dist = num
        if current_dist < min_dist:
            min_dist = current_dist
            closest_num = num
            closest_index = index

    # Return the closer element in the list
    return Tuple(closest_num, closest_dist), closest_index
```
This Python code defines a function called `find_closest_elements` that takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and aims to find and return the closest pair of elements from the list, along with their corresponding distances. The function uses the precise algorithm for finding the closest element, comparing the current element's value to find the smallest one among all the remaining elements. It initializes variables for the particular element and its index that are the smallest, and then iterates through the list to update these variables accordingly. Finally, the function returns a closest element and its corresponding distance as a tuple.

In this way, the `find_closest_elements` function efficiently finds and returns the closest pair of elements from the input list of numbers. It handles the types and typing for a more robust and clear code.
