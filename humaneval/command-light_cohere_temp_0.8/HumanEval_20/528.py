The provided code defines a function called **find_closest_elements** that aims to find the closest pair of elements within the provided list of numbers. The function utilizes nested loops to compare each pair of numbers and determine their distance. The code aims to find the closest pair of numbers, which are defined as the elements in the list that are closest to each other. The code uses the specific logic to find the closest elements and returns the result as a tuple containing the two closest numbers.
