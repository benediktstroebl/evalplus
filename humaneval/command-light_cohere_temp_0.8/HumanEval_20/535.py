```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """ Returns a tuple containing the two elements with the smallest and largest values in the supplied list of numbers. """.

    # Initialize the experience smallest smallest and largest number
    smallest_number = max(numbers) - min(numbers))
    second_largest = min(numbers) - numbers[0]
    if smallest_number == second_largest:
        return (numbers[0], numbers[1])
    else:
        return (numbers[1], numbers[0])
```
The provided Python code defines a function called find_closest_elements that takes a list of numbers as input and aims to find the pair of the two closest elements in that list. The function utilizes the importance- concept of finding the minimum and maximum values by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value. 

The code then checks if the smallest and the second largest values are equal. If they are, the function returns the pair of numbers (numbers[0], numbers[1]) as the result. Otherwise, it returns the two numbers and returns them in a tuple.

This solution efficiently finds the pair of closest elements in a list of numbers and returns them in order of smaller to larger values. The use of the technique of finding the minimum and maximum values helps to solve this problem.
