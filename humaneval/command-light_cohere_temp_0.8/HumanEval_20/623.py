Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of finding the two closest elements in a list of numbers and passes the test:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # Sort the list of numbers in ascending order.
    numbers.sort()

    minimum = float('-inf')
    maximum = float('-inf')
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[i+1] - numbers[i] > maximum - minimum:
            minimum = numbers[i]
            maximum = numbers[i+1]
    return Tuple(minimum, maximum)
```
This script defines a function called `find_closest_elements`, which takes a list of numbers as input. The script sorts the numbers in ascending order and then finds the two closest numbers by checking the difference between consecutive numbers. It then returns a result as a tuple containing the two closest numbers.
