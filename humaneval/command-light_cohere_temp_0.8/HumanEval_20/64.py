This Python function, named `find_closest_elements`, takes a list of numbers as its parameter. It aims to find the closest pair of elements within the list. The function uses the variables `x1`, `x2`, `a1`, and `a2` to keep track of the two closest elements. 

The function loops through the list of numbers, calculates the distance between each number and the variables, and updates the variables accordingly. The function also keeps track of the closest elements in the list. Finally, the function returns the variables containing the two closest elements in the list and returns them.
