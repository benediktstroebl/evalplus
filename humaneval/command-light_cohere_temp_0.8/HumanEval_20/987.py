```python
from typing import List

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """
    Selects and returns two numbers that are closest to each other.
    """
    numbers.sort()
    select1.index(numbers[ len(numbers) - 1] // 2, -1, numbers.
    return numbers[ len(numbers) - 1 // 2, -1]
```
The function returns a tuple containing the two closest elements in the list.

In order to test the correctness of the function, you can run the function with sample inputs.
