Here's the solution:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # Sort the numbers in ascending order
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    # Initialize the first and second closest numbers with the first and last numbers in the sorted list
    first_number = sorted_numbers[0]
    second_number = sorted_numbers[-1]
    # Initialize a list to store the distance between the two numbers
    distances = [first_number[1:]second_number[1]]
    # Calculate the distance between the two numbers using their squares
    distance = (first_number[1]**2 + second_number[1]**2)
    # Find the index of the smaller number in the list of distances
    index_of_smaller = distances.index_of_smaller
    minimum_distance = float("inf")
    for index, distance in enumerate(distances):
        if distance < minimum_distance:
            minimum_distance = distance
            index_of_smaller = index
    return first_number, second_number, minimum_distance, index_of_smaller
```

This code creates a function called `find_closest_elements`, which takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns a tuple containing the two numbers that are closest to each other and the minimum distance between them. The function sorts the first and last numbers in the list, then finds the square of the difference between the two numbers. The function then iterates through the list of distances and finds the index of the smaller number. Finally, it returns the minimum distance and the index of the smaller number.
