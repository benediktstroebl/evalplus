Here's the code:
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # Sort the list of numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort(numbers)
    # Initialize the smallest number and the largest number to infinity and negative infinity, respectively
    smallest = float("inf")
    largest = float("-inf")
    # Compare the largest and smallest number
    if numbers[0] > largest:
        largest = numbers[0]
    if numbers[0] < smallest:
        smallest = numbers[0]
    # Search for the two closest numbers in the sorted list
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        # If the current number is less than the smallest, update the smallest and largest
        if num < numbers[0]:
            smallest = num
            largest = numbers[0]
        # If the current number is greater than or equal to the largest, update the largest and smallest
        elif num > numbers[0]:
            largest = num
    # Return the smaller and larger numbers
    return smallest, largest
```
The code you provided is a Python function called find_closest_elements, which takes a list of numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the two closest numbers from the input list. The function uses the time and logic to sort the input list of numbers in ascending order and then iterates through the sorted list to find the two closest numbers. The function then updates the values of the smallest and largest numbers in the list and then returns them as the result of the function.
