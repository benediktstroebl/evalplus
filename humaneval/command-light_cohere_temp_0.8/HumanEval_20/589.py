Here is a Python script that can solve the problem of finding the closest elements from a list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List
from typing import Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """ Returns the closest two elements in the list, along with the separation between them.

    : Type the numbers into a list, and return a tuple containing the two closest elements in order of their separation.
    """ return (numbers[0][0], 1.0)
```
