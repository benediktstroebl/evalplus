Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of finding the closest elements from a list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return numbers
    else:
        # Sort the list of numbers in ascending order
        sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
        first_element, second_element = (sorted_numbers[0], sorted_numbers[1])
        return first_element, second_element
```
The code works by first checking the length of the input list of numbers. If the length is less than two, the list is returned as is, because there can't be a pair of closest elements. If the length is greater than two, the code will sort the list of numbers and then select the first and second elements of the sorted list to form a pair of the closest elements.

The code then returns the pair of the closest elements.
