This Python code defines a function called `find_closest_elements` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the two closest elements from the list along with their separation. 

The function first checks if the list has less than two elements, and returns the list as is, without any changes. The function then sorts the list in ascending order. 

Next, it finds the two closest elements using the `min` and `max` functions with the `key` argument set to the lambda function that extracts the corresponding elements from the sorted list. 

Finally, the function returns the tuple containing the two closest elements and their separation. 

This code demonstrates a way to find the closest elements from a list of numbers, which can be useful in various applications such as data analysis and machine learning.
