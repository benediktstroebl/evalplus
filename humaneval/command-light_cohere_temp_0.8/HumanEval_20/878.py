Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of finding two closest elements from a list of numbers:

```python
from typing import List

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # sort the list of numbers
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    # get the first and last numbers
    first_number = sorted_numbers[0]
    last_number = sorted_numbers[-1]
    # get the difference between the two numbers
    difference = abs(last_number - first_number)
    # get the minimum number of the difference list
    min_diff = difference[0]
    # get the index of the minimum difference value
    index_of_min_diff = 0
    # get the number of the minimum difference value
    min_diff_number = sorted_numbers[index_of_min_diff]
    # return the two numbers with the minimum difference
    return (first_number, last_number), min_diff_number
```

This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a tuple of two closest elements along with the difference between the two numbers. 

This function uses the typing module to ensure that the input argument is a list of float values and also uses a tuple to return the two values.
