    closest_num, second_closest = float('inf'), float('-inf')

            if abs(current_num - second_num) < closest_num + second_closest:

```

This function will return the two numbers in the list that are the closest to each other, along with the distance between them. 

Note that this function will return a tuple with the two numbers, and the order of the numbers will be the smaller number first.
