This Python code uses the 'find_closest_elements' function, which takes a list of numbers as an input and returns a tuple with the two numbers that are closest to each other. It uses the typing module to add type hints to the function, which assert the list has at least two elements and is sorted by the value of the second element. The test cases show how the compare the function to compare different types of numbers, including tuples, lists, and individual values.
