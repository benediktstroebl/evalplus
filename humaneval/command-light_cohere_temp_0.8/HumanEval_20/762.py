```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """
    Selects and returns two elements in numbers that are closest to each other.
    """return min(numbers[0] , numbers[1]) , max(numbers[0] , numbers[1])
```
The provided Python script defines a function named `find_closest_elements` that takes a list of numbers as input and aims to find and return the closest pair of two elements from the list.

The function employs the `min` and `max` functions to identify the minimum and maximum values in the list, respectively. Then, it returns the closest elements based on these calculated minimum and maximum values. 

This approach efficiently finds the closest pair of elements in the list by comparing their values.
