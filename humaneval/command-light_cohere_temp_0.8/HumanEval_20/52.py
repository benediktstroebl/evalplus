Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of finding the closest elements from a list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """ From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

    Parameters:
        numbers: List[float] - A list of floating-point numbers

    Returns:
        Tuple[float, float] - A tuple containing the two closest numbers, with the smaller number first.
    """
    two numbers in the list of numbers that are closest to each other.

```
This function uses the typing module to define the function signature. The function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the two numbers that are closest to each other. The function uses the algorithm to find the closest pair of numbers in the list.
