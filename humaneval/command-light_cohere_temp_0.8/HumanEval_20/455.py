```python
from typing import List

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # Sort the numbers in descending order
    numbers.sort(numbers, reverse=True)
    # Take the first two numbers in the sorted list
    return numbers[0:2], numbers[1]
```
This Python code defines a function called find_closest_elements that takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns a tuple of the two closest numbers in the list, along with the index of the larger number. The function first sorts the2 numbers in descending order using the sort() function with reverse=True, then takes the first two numbers from the sorted list and returns them as a tuple. This function effectively finds the read-only number from the input list and returns the largest number as the first element of the tuple.
