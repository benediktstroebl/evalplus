Here is the answer to your prompt:

```python
def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """
    Return a tuple containing the two numbers that are closest.
    """
    from the2 and x are assigned to two variables. Then, the function EuclideanDistance calculates the distance between the two variables and the function min finds the smallest number, which is closest. The two variables are then assigned to the variables closest1 and closest2.
    return (closest1, closest2)
