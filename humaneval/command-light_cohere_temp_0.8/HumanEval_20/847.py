```python
from typing import List

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """
    Selects two elements from the list that are closest to each other and returns them in order (smaller number, larger number).

    Parameters:
        numbers: List[float] - List of numbers of length at least two

    Returns:
        Tuple[float, float] - A tuple containing the two elements that are closest to each other.
 """

Here's a test case to verify the correctness of the function:

```python
# Test Case
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]

find_closest_elements(numbers)
```
