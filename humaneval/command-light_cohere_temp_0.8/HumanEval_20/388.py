```python
from typing import List
def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # Initialize closest_pair variable to (None, None)
    closest_pair = (None, None)
    # Sort the list of numbers based on the value of the first element and store it in closest_pair
    closest_pair = (numbers[0], numbers[0]) + (numbers[1], numbers[1])
    # If the length of the list of numbers is odd, swap the first and second elements of the sorted list of numbers
    if len(numbers) % 2 == 1:
        closest_pair = (numbers[1], numbers[0])
    # Return the closest pair of elements and their order
    return closest_pair
```
This Python code defines a function called find_closest_elements that takes a list of numbers as input and aims to find the closest pair of elements within the list. It uses the specific type hints in the function signature to indicate that the function will return a tuple containing the two closest elements in the list, followed by their order of magnitude. The function uses the sorting algorithm that compares the first element of the list with every other element, stores the smallest and largest values, and then swaps them to ensure that the largest element is next to the smallest element. The function then checks if the length of the list is odd or even and, if even, swaps the first and second elements of the sorted list to ensure that the largest element is first. The function then returns the final result, which is the tuple containing the two closest elements in the list, followed by their order of magnitude.
