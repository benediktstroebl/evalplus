Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you provided:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return numbers
    else:
        # sort the list of numbers in descending order
        sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers, reverse=True)
        # create a tuple with two elements from the sorted list
        return Tuple(sorted_numbers[0], sorted_numbers[1])

# test cases
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2]

result = find_closest_elements(numbers)

print(result)
```

This script defines a function `find_closest_elements` that accepts a list of numbers and returns a tuple with the two closest elements in it. It handles edge cases by checking the length of the input list and returning the original list if it's of length at least two. It then sorts the relatively two elements in descending order using the `sorted` function with `reverse=True` parameter. It then returns a expected tuple with the two elements. 

Finally, the test cases are passed and the function is called with the test data, and the result is printed.
