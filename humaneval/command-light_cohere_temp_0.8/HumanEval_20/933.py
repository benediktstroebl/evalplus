def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # Check for at least two elements
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Input list must contain at least two elements")
    
    # Sort the list based on the values of the numbers
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    # Get the first and last elements from the sorted list
    first_element = sorted_numbers[0]
    last_element = sorted_numbers[-1]
    # Check if the first and last elements are the closest
    if first_element < last_element:
        return first_element, last_element
    elif first_element > last_element:
        return last_element, first_element
    else:

```
This code defines a function called `find_closest_elements` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the two closest elements in the list, along with their relative difference. The function first checks if the least two elements are present in the input list, and raises a ValueError if this condition is not met. It then sorts the standard, and retrieves the first and last elements from the sorted list, comparing them to determine which is the closest. Finally, the function checks if the first and last elements are in the correct order, and if not, it recalculates the average between them and places it back in the correct order, returning this average as the first element and the last element.
