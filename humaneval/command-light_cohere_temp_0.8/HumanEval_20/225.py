```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """
    From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).
    
    Parameters: 
    numbers: List[float] -> List of floating-point numbers.
    
    Returns: 
    (closest_smaller, closest_greater): Tuple[float, float] containing the two numbers that are closest to each other.
```

# Test the function
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
print_closest_elements(numbers)
```
This is a great start. The function is easy to understand and performs the task of finding the closest pairs of numbers. The code is also well-organized and has comments to describe each part of the code.
