```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # check for length 2
    if len(numbers) != 2:
        raise ValueError("Input list must be of length 2")

    # sort the numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort(num for num in numbers if num >= 0)

    # select the first element as the smaller number
    smaller_number = numbers[0]

    # find the second largest number in the list
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        if smaller_number > num:
            smaller_number = num

    # return the two numbers
    return smaller_number, larger_number
```
The provided Python code defines a function called find_closest_elements that takes a list of numbers as input and aims to find the closest pair of elements within the list. The function first checks if the list has exactly two elements, and if not, raises a ValueError to prevent incorrect usage. Then, it sorts the list in ascending order. Next, the function selects the first element as the smaller number and iterates through the remaining elements of the list to find the second largest number. Finally, it returns the two closest elements in the list, which are the two numbers that are the closest to each other.
