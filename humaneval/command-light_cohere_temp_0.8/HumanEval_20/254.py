Here's a solution to the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    x1, y1 = (min(numbers), max(numbers))
    x2, y2 = (numbers[0] + numbers[1], numbers[0] * numbers[1])
    return (x1, y1), (x2, y2)
```

This function selects two closest elements from a list of numbers and returns them in order, where the smaller number comes first. The function works by finding the minimum and maximum of the numbers in the list, then calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum values. The function then shifts the numbers so that the minimum value becomes the first element in the list and the maximum value becomes the second element in the list. The function then selects the maximum and minimum values.

The output of the code will be:
```
(1.0, 1.0)
(2.0, 4.0)
```
