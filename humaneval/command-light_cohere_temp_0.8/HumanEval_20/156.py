Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return numbers, 0.1
    else:
        # Sort the numbers in descending order
        sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers, reverse=True)
        
        # Initialize variables to store the first and second closest numbers
        first = last = float('inf')
        second = None
        
        # Iterate through the sorted numbers
        for num in sorted_numbers:
            if first > num:
                first = num
                second = last
            elif second is None or second > num:
                second = num
                last = num
        
        return first, second
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a tuple of the two closest numbers along with their relative order. The function first checks if the numbers list is empty or not, and if not, it simply returns the numbers in the list and returns them as the answer. If the list is not empty, the function then sorts the list in descending order and initializes two variables to store the first and second closest numbers. Then, the function iterates through the sorted numbers and compares the current number with the values stored in the first and second variables. If the current number is larger than the first number, the first variable is updated to the current number. If the current number is smaller than the second number, the second variable is updated to the current number. If the current number is neither smaller nor larger than the second number, the second variable is updated to the current number. Then, the function continues iterating through the sorted numbers until it finds two numbers that are the closest to each other. The function then returns the first and second variables, which store the two closest numbers and their relative order.
