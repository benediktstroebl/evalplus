```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # type of the function, parameter, and return values are provided to Python's type check
    return (type(min(numbers, key=lambda n: abs(n - other)) == float), other)
```

This function takes a list of numbers as an input and returns a tuple with two closest elements in the list. Additionally, the function uses the Python's built-in `min` and `abs` functions, which are used to compare and find the closest elements in the list, respectively. The function returns a tuple containing the smallest number and the largest number in the list, in that order.
