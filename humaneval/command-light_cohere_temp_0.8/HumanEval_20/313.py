Here's a solution for the provided problem:
```python
from typing import List
from typing import Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """ Returns the two closest elements in the list, and their relationship """
    # Sort the list
    numbers.sort(key=lambda num: num, -num)
    # Get the two closest elements
    index1 = next(i for i, j in enumerate(numbers) if numbers[i] < numbers[j])[0]
    index2 = next(i for i, j in enumerate(numbers) if numbers[i] > numbers[j])[0]
    # Return the two elements
    return Tuple(numbers[index1], numbers[index2])
```
This function takes a list of numbers and returns a tuple containing the two closest elements in the list, with their relationship being returned in that order.
