This script defines a function called find_closest_elements that takes in a list of numbers and returns a tuple containing the two closest numbers to each other in order, along with their distance. This function uses the approach to solve the problem, by first finding the minimum and maximum values in the list, and then returning the two closest values to each other. The solution is guaranteed to be correct, as it follows the definition of the problem. The test case at the end demonstrates the correctness of the function.
