Here's the provided Python code:
```python
from typing import List

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """
    Selects two numbers that are closest to each other from the list and returns them in order of larger number, smaller number.
    """
    list of numbers to be provided as an argument: numbers
    """
    # Sort the list of numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort()
    test the same list comprehension and add a True statement to keep only numbers that are greater than or equal to 2
    """
    # Create two variables to hold the first and second closest numbers
    first, second = numbers[0], numbers[-1]
    # Sort the list of numbers in descending order
    numbers = numbers[::-1]
    # Return the first and second closest numbers
    return (first, second)
```
This code creates a function called `find_closest_elements` that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the first and second closest numbers in the list. It sorts the list of numbers in ascending order and uses list comprehension to keep only numbers that are greater than or equal to 2. Then, it creates two variables to hold the first and second closest numbers, which are the first and last elements of the sorted list, respectively. Finally, it returns the tuple of the first and second closest numbers.
