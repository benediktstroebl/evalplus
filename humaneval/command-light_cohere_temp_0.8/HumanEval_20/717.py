```python
from typing import List

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """ Returns a tuple containing the two closest elements in the list, and the distance between them.

    If a list contains at least two numbers, it uses the `sorted()` function with a custom key to sort the list based on the ascending order of the numbers.
    will return the similarity is solved with a single loop. 

    is less efficient for a list with a large number of elements.
 """ The function will work with any list of numbers, but it is designed to work particularly well with lists of two numbers.

The function uses the `sorted()` function to sort the list based on the ascending order of the numbers, and then uses the `argorder` function to get the two closest elements in the list.

The function then returns a tuple containing the two closest elements in the list and the distance between them. 
```
In other words, the function will find the two closest elements in the list and return them in order of their similarity.
