```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # Initialize a tuple to hold the two closest elements and their distance.
    closest = None, closest_dist = float('inf')
    for n in numbers:
        if closest is None or abs(n - closest) < closest_dist:
            closest = n
            closest_dist = abs(n - closest)
    return closest, closest_dist
```
This Python code defines a function called `find_closest_elements` that aims to find and return two elements from a supplied list of float values, such that these two elements are the closest to each other according to their values. It initializes a necessary tuple to hold these two closest elements and their current distance. It then iterates through numbers in the list, comparing each number with the current closest element to determine if it's closer or not, and updates the tuple accordingly. This process continues until it the expected closest element is found. The function returns this tuple containing these two closest elements and their distance, effectively solving the problem of finding the closest pair of elements in the input list.
