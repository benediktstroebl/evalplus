```python
from typing import List
def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """ From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).
    
    Parameters:
        numbers: List[float]

    Returns:
        Tuple[float, float]: A tuple containing the two closest elements in the list in order of the corresponding values.
```

This code is a great example of a self-contained function that solves a specific problem. It takes advantage of the mathematical and functional programming principles.
