```python
from typing import List

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """ Selects and returns two closest elements from a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two), and returns them in order (smaller number, larger number).
    The function takes a list of float numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the two numbers that are the closest to each other, in order of their values.

A working example of the function:
```python
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2]

result = (2.0, 3.0)
```
```
