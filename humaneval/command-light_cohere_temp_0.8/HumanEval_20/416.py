Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return numbers, 0.0
    closest = (numbers[0] if numbers[0] < numbers[1] else numbers[1])
    return closest, (numbers[1] - numbers[0])

# Test case
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
#find_closest_elements(numbers)
```

This script uses the `find_closest_elements` function to solve the problem. It will select the closest elements in the list and return them in order.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(1) because it is a constant time algorithm.
