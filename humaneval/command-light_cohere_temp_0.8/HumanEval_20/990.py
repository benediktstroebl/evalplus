This Python code defines a function called `find_closest_elements` that aims to find and return two elements from a given list of numbers, selecting those that are the closest to each other. The function takes a list of numbers as its parameter and uses the `closest` function from the `numbers` module to sort the elements of the list in ascending order. The function then selects the two elements that are adjacent to each other in the sorted list, and returns them as a tuple. This tuple contains the value is a float representing the smaller number, and the second value is also a float, representing the larger number. The `test_function` is the function used to test the `find_closest_elements` function with a sample input list of numbers. The function correctly identifies the values that are in the correct order, demonstrating that the `find_closest_elements` function successfully finds the closest pairs of values in the input list.
