```python
from typing import List

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort(numbers, key=lambda x: x)
    # Extract the first and last elements from the sorted list
    first, last = numbers[0], numbers[-1]
    # Calculate the distance between the first and last elements
    distance = ((first - last)**2).0) / 2.0
   0
    result of distance
    # Return the two elements that are the closest to each other and their order
    return (first, last)
```
This code defines a function `find_closest_elements` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a tuple of the two closest elements in the list, along with their distance. The code uses the sorting technique to arrange the input list, extracts the first and last elements from the sorted list, and then determines the separation between these elements. Finally, the function returns the tuple containing the two closest elements and their order, based on the calculated distance.
