Here's the solution:
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    x1, y1 = min(numbers), max(numbers)
    x2, y2 = numbers[1], numbers[0]
    while x1 != x2:
        x1, y1 = x2, y2
        x2, y2 = numbers[1], numbers[0]
    return x1, y1

# Test
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0]
min_distance = find_closest_elements(numbers)
print("Minimum distance:", min_distance)

numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0]
largest_element = find_closest_elements(numbers)
print("Largest element:", largest_element)

```
The provided Python script defines a function find_closest_elements that takes a list of numbers as input and aims to find and return the two closest elements from the list, along with the corresponding distances. The function employs the min() and max() functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the list, respectively. This process is then repeated until the two values converge to the same. 

The function is then tested with a sample list of numbers to demonstrate its functionality. The output will display the minimum distance and the largest element from the list.
