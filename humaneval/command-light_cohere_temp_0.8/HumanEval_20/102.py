```

The function "find_closest_elements" takes a list of numbers (float) as input and returns a tuple of two numbers that are the closest to each other. The function uses the sorting method to sort the numbers in descending order and then selects the two closest numbers from the sorted list. The function then returns a tuple containing the two closest numbers, and the original list of numbers.

The test cases pass without any errors, and the function returns the correct result.
