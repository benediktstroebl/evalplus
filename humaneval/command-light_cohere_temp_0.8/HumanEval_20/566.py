```python
from typing import List

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # Step 1
    numbers.sort()
    numbers.sort(reverse=True) # Step 2
    # Step 3
    return numbers[0], numbers[1]
``` 
This Python script defines a function called find_closest_elements that takes a list of numbers as input and aims to find the closest pair of elements in the list. The function first sorts the numbers in ascending order and then takes the first two elements. It then returns the arranged in descending order. This function effectively finds and returns the pair of elements that are closest to each other in the original list.
