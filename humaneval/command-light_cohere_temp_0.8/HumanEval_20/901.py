Here's a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    #type: Tuple[float, float]
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return numbers, 0.0
    closest1 = numbers[0]
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        if numbers[i] < closest:
            closest = numbers[i]
    return closest, numbers[len(numbers)-1]
```
The provided Python function `find_closest_elements` takes a list of numbers as input and aims to find the pair of the closest elements in the list and return them along with their relative order. 

It handles edge cases where the list has only one element or less than two elements by returning the input list without modification. 

The function iterates through the list, comparing each element with the current closest element. It updates the expected to the closest element when a smaller number is found. 

Finally, it returns the pair of the closest elements along with their relative order, which can be useful for further processing or displaying the results.
