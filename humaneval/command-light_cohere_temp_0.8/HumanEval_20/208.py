```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """
    Selects and returns two elements that are the closest to each other from a supplied list of numbers.
    """
    test for this program:
    >>> numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
    f1 the2 and closest values.  #"""
 case"""

    ** {1.0, 4.0} * 4.0}0}2}
    list of all possible tuples (pairwise closest values) from the list, in order of decreasing magnitude.
    }
```

The function use Python's built-in function `sorted` to get the list of all possible tuples that are the closest to each other in the list. The function then returns the tuple that contains the two closest values.
