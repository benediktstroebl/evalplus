```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # Initialize variables
    min_dist = float('inf')
    closest_element = None
    second_closest_element = None
    
    # Loop through the list
    for num, i in zip(numbers, range(len(numbers))):
        # Calculate the distance to the current closest element
        dist = (num - closest_element)**2
        if dist < min_dist:
            min_dist = dist
            closest_element = num
        
        # Calculate the distance to the current second closest element
        dist = (num - second_closest_element)**2
        if dist < min_dist:
            min_dist = dist
            second_closest_element = num
    
    return min_dist, closest_element, second_closest_element
```

This function utilizes the `zip` function to simultaneously iterate over the list of numbers and the index range. It calculates the distances between each number and the two closest elements, and then determines which two elements are the closest to each other based on the minimum distance. The function returns the minimum distance, the closest element, and the second closest element.
