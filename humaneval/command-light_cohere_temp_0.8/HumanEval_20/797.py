```python
from typing import List

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # initializing two variables to hold the closest numbers and the index of the smaller number
    closest = float("inf")
    smaller = numbers[0]
    
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        # Updating closest and smaller variables based on the current element
        closest = min(numbers[i], closest)
        smaller = numbers[i]
        
        # Checking if the smaller number is the one in the original list
        if smaller == numbers[0]:
            break
             # returning the two values in order of the smaller number, larger number
            return smaller, closest
```
The provided Python code defines a function called find_closest_elements that takes a list of numbers as input and aims to find the closest pair of elements within the list. It initializes two variables, closest and smaller, to represent the two values that are closest to each other and the index of the smaller number, respectively. The code then iterates through the list, starting from the second element, and compares each element to the current closest value, updating the variables accordingly. It then checks if the for the smaller number to be equal to the number at index 0 of the original list, indicating that it is the closest element. Finally, the function returns the two values, smaller and closest, in that order.
