Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem of finding the closest elements between a list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """ 
    Find the two closest elements in the list and return them in order of decreasing value.
    """
    list of numbers is provided as a parameter, which is of length at least two. We then sort thea two elements that are the closest to each other according to the input list.
    as determined by the return the first element in the sorted list that is less than the second element, and return them in order of decreasing value.
    }

return numbers[0], numbers[1]]
```

This script solves the problem of finding the closest elements in a list of numbers, by first sorting the list of numbers according to their values, and then returning the first and second elements in the sorted list.
