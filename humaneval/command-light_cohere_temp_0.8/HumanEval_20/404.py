```python
from typing import List

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # Initialize distance and previous variables
    distance: = {(num, index): float() for index, num in enumerate(numbers)}
    previous: = {(num, index): None for index, num in enumerate(numbers)}

    # Initialize the minimum and maximum values
    min_dist, max_dist = float('inf'), float('-inf')
    for index, num in enumerate(numbers):
        # Calculate the current distance to the previous number
        current_dist = numbers[index] - num
        previous[index] = current_dist
        distance[index] = current_dist

        # Update the minimum and maximum distances
        min_dist = min(min_dist, distance[index])
        max_dist = max(max_dist, distance[index])

    # Find the closest elements
    closest = [min_dist, max_dist]
    return closest

# Example usage:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0]

print(find_closest_elements(numbers)))
```

This script defines a function called `find_closest_elements` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the two closest elements. The function uses a Pythonic approach with nested dictionaries and the `min` and `max` functions to find the closest elements.

The output of the example usage will be `[0.0, 1.0]`, which is the correct output.
