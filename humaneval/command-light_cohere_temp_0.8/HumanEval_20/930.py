```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # take the first element as the pivot
    pivot = numbers[0]
    # sort all other elements based on this pivot
    numbers.sort()
   
    largest = -values[0]
    smallest = -numbers[0]
    # select the two largest elements and return them in order (largest, smaller number)
    return (largest, smallest)
