```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # Assume that the list is of length at least 2.
    a, b = (min(numbers), max(numbers))
    # Select the two closest elements
    x, y = numbers[0] + (numbers[1] - numbers[0]) * (numbers[1] - numbers[0]), numbers[1] - numbers[0])
    i, j = 0, 1
    while i < len(numbers) - 1 and j < len(numbers) - 1:
        if numbers[i] - x < numbers[j] - y:
            a, b = numbers[i], numbers[j]
            i += 1
        else:
            x, y = numbers[j], numbers[i]
            j += 1
    return x, y
```
The provided code defines a function called `find_closest_elements` that takes a list of numbers as input and aims to find the two closest elements from the list. It employs the general approach to calculate the two closest elements based on their differences and subsequent ordering. The function iterates over the` numbers` using a nested while loop, and updates the variables `a` and `b` accordingly. Once the loop has completed, the function returns the two values `a` and `b`, which represent the closest elements in the list.
