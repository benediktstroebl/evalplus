Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the tests:
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    x, y = (min(numbers), max(numbers))
    return (x, y)

numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2]

print(find_closest_elements(numbers))
```
This code uses the min() and max() functions from the built-in typing module to solve the problem of finding the closest elements in a list of numbers. 

The code is properly self-contained, can be imported into a Python project as a module, and does not rely on any other functions or variables that are not part of the code.
