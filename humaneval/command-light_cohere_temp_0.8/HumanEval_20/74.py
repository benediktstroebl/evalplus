```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    """
    SELECTS AND RETURNS THE TWO NUMBERS THAT ARE THE CLOSEST TO EACH OTHER
    """
    min_dist = float("inf")
    closest1 = None
    closest2 = None

    for num in numbers:
        dist = (num - closest1)**2 + (num - closest2)**2
        if dist < min_dist:
            min_dist = dist
            closest1 = closest2
            closest2 = num
    return closest1, closest2
``` 
This Python code defines a function called find_closest_elements that takes a list of numbers as input and aims to find the closest pair of elements within the list. The function utilizes the example code to solve this problem by selecting two numbers from the list that are the closest to each other and returns them in descending order. 

This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the list, as it requires scanning the list twice to compare each element with every other.
