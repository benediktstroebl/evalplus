Here is the solution to the problem:
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # Sort the list of numbers
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    # Get the first and last elements of the sorted list
    first_element = sorted_numbers[0]
    last_element = sorted_numbers[-1]
    # Return the two closest elements
    return first_element, last_element
```

The code you provided is a Python script that contains a function called `find_closest_elements`. This function takes in a list of numbers and returns the two closest elements in that list, along with their order of closeness.

The `find_closest_elements` function uses the `sorted` function to sort the list of numbers. The first element of the list is then assigned to the variable `first_element`, and the last element is assigned to the variable `last_element`. 

The function then returns the two closest elements in order, where the first element is assigned to the variable `first_element`, and the last element is assigned to the variable `last_element`.
