```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort(numbers, key=lambda n: n)
    # Initialize variables
    smaller, larger = numbers[0], numbers[-1]
    # Iterate through the list of numbers in reverse order
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1, -1):
        current = numbers[i]
        if current < smaller:
            smaller = current
        if current > larger:
            larger = current
    return smaller, larger
```
This Python code defines a function named find_closest_elements that takes a list of numbers as input and aims to find the closest pair of elements within the list. The function achieves this task by first sorting the input list of numbers using the sort() method with a custom key function that prioritizes smaller values. It then initializes two variables smaller and larger with the first and last elements of the sorted list, respectively. The function then iterates through the list in reverse order, comparing each element with the two variables to find the closest pair. The closest pair of elements is returned as a tuple (smaller, larger), which represents the order of the two closest elements.
