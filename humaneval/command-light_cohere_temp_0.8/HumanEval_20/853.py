Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:

```python
from typing import List

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]):
    # initialise the variables
    smallest = float("inf")
    second = float("inf")
    # compare the two numbers and assign the smallest one to the variable smallest
    if numbers[0] < numbers[1]:
        smallest = numbers[0]
    else:
        smallest = numbers[1]
    # assign the second number to the variable second
    second = numbers[0]
    # return a tuple with the two closest numbers and their order
    return smallest, second
```
