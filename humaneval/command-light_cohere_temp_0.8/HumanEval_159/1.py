The function `eat` takes three parameters: `number`, `need`, and `remaining`. It returns a tuple of two integers, representing the total number of carrots eaten and the number of remaining carrots, respectively. 
This function enforces input validation constraints by checking if the inputs are valid (not negative) and returns an appropriate result based on the constraints. 

The function calculates the total number of carrots eaten, checks if there are enough remaining carrots, and returns the total number of carrots eaten and the number of remaining carrots if there are enough remaining carrots. If there aren't enough carrots, the function returns the total number of carrots eaten minus the remaining carrots.
