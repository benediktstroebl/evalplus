Here is a Python script that solves the problem of finding the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a given list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a given list of input numbers.
    Calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of this dataset.
    MAD = average | x -x_mean |
    where x is each element of the input list, x_mean is the mean of the list.
    """
    response:
def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    # Calculate the mean of the input list of numbers
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    # Calculate the sum of absolute deviations from the mean for each number
    mad_sum = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers)
    # Calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation by taking the average of the sum of absolute deviations
    return mad_sum / len(numbers)
```
