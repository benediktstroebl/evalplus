Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of calculating the Mean Absolute Deviation in a markdown code block:

```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers):
    # Initialize variables
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    x = [num for num in numbers]
    # Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    MAD = sum(x[i] - mean) / len(x)
    return MAD
```

This script provides a self-contained function that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a given list of numbers.

The function first calculates the mean of the input list. Then, it initializes an new list `x` to store the deviation of each element from the mean. The function then calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation by summing up the squared differences between each element and the mean, and then dividing by the length of the list.

Finally, the function returns the calculated Mean Absolute Deviation.
