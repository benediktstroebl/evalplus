```python
from typing import List
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers):
    return math.sqrt((sum(numbers[i] - numbers[int(i)]) for i in range(len(numbers)))) / math.sqrt(sum(numbers[i] - numbers[int(i)] for i in range(len(numbers))))
```
This function uses the mean of a dataset to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation, which is a measure of the average absolute difference between each element and the mean.
