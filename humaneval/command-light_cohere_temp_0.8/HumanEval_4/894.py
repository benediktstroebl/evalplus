Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you described:

```python
from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ 
    Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation for a given list of input numbers 
    around the mean of this dataset.
    MAD = average | x -x_mean |
    where x is each element in the input list and x_mean is the mean of the 
    list.
    The following test conditions are met:
    - Input list is not empty
    - Input list contains at least one numeric element
    Return value: Mean Absolute Deviation of the input list
  """
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        raise ValueError("Input list cannot be empty")
    if len(numbers) == 1:
        return 0.0  # INFO: Considering the approach, the code works for any input list
    with at least one numeric element. 
The MAD is calculated using the formula:
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    where average is the mean of the list.
