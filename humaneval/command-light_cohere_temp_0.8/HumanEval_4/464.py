Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you have described:

```python
from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ 
    Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation for a given list of input numbers 
    around the mean of this dataset.

    MAD = average | x -x_mean | 
    where x is each element of the input list and x_mean is the mean of the 
    list.
    """
    return float(MAD)
```
This function takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for that list, which is a measure of the average absolute difference between each element and the mean of the dataset.
