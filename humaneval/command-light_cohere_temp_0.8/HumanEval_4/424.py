```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.

    MAD = sum(x_mean - x) / len(numbers) 
    where x_mean = numbers.mean()

    also the, this will ensure that the output is always positive.

    return: 
    import math
    return math.sqrt(MAD)
```

This script defines a function **`mean_absolute_deviation`** that takes a list of numbers and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD). The MAD is calculated by summing the difference between each element and the mean of the dataset, then dividing it by the total number of elements. This ensures the result is always positive.
