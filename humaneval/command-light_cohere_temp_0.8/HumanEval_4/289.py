Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the tests:

```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset. MAD is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    where x_mean = mean(numbers)
    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
   0.0 ( 1.5) 1.0)
   0.2]
   ```
