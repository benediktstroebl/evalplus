Here's the answer to the prompt:

```python
from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ 
    Calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a given list of input numbers. 
    The MAD is the average absolute difference between each 
    element and the mean.
    """ 
    x = numbers[0] 
    y = numbers[1]
    x_mean = (x+y)/2.0
    x_diff = abs(x-x_mean)
    y_diff = abs(y-x_mean)
    mad = (x_diff + y_diff)/2.0
   return mad
```

This function takes a list of numbers and calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) as defined in the problem statement. It is using the absolute difference between each element and the mean of the dataset. 

The MAD value is returned by the function.
