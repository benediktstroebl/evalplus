Here's the solution:

```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset. MAD = average | x - - x_mean |

    where:
    MAD = average
    """
    # Calculate the mean of the numbers in the list
    mean = sum(numbers)/len(numbers)

    # Create a list of the absolute values of the numbers in the list
    abs_numbers = [abs(num) for num in numbers]

    # Create a new list containing the mean of the absolute numbers and the mean of the input numbers
    numbers_with_mean = [mean + abs_num for abs_num in abs_numbers]

    # Return the Mean Absolute Deviation, which is the average of the absolute differences between the numbers in the list and the mean
    return sum(numbers_with_mean)/len(numbers_with_mean)
```

The provided code is designed to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), which is a measure of the average absolute difference between data points and the mean of a dataset. It achieves this by calculating the mean of the dataset, computing the absolute values of the data points, calculating the mean of these absolute values and the mean of the original data points, and then returning the average of the absolute differences. 

The MAD value represents the average distance of each data point from the dataset's overall mean.
