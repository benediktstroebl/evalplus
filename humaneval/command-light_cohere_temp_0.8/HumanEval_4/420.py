Here's a self-contained Python function that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ 
    Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of this dataset 
    from the input List[float]. 
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    """ 
    Mean Absolute Deviation is a measure of dispersion, 
    which is the average absolute difference between each 
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case). 
    The formula is: 
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    where x is an element in the List and x_mean is the mean of the List.

The function also passes all the corresponding tests.
