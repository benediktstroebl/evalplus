Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of calculating the mean absolute deviation (MAD) for a given list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ 
    Calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation for the input dataset
    """
    # Get the mean of the dataset
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    # Initialize the result variable
    mad = 0.0
    # Calculate the	
    for x in numbers:
        # Calculate the difference between the element and the mean
        mad += (x - mean) ** 2
    # Calculate the average of the absolute deviations and return the result
    return mad / len(numbers)
```
This script defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the mean absolute deviation. The function first computes the difference between each element in the list and the mean of the dataset. The function then adds up these squared values of these differences, calculates the average of these squared differences, and then divides the result by the total number of elements to obtain the MAD value.

This script is a complete self-contained solution that can be used to calculate the MAD for any given list of numbers.
