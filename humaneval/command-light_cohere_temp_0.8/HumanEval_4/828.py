Here's a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem of calculating the mean absolute deviation:

```python
from typing import List
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]):
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset. MAD = average | x - - all
    elements and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = math.sqrt(sum((x - difference between each
    element and the mean) / len(numbers)))
    return MAD
```
The code includes a function called `mean_absolute_deviation`, which takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of the dataset.

The `mean_absolute_deviation` function uses the `math.sqrt()` function to calculate the absolute difference between each element and the mean of the dataset. The function then sums these absolute differences and divides it by the number of elements in the list to get the average absolute difference. The result is then the Mean Absolute Deviation value, which is returned by the function.
