```python
from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    # Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    MAD = sum([x - mean for mean in zip(numbers) for x in numbers]) / len(numbers)
    return MAD
``` 
The code provides a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers. It does this by calculating the sum of absolute differences between each element and the mean, and then dividing it by the length of the list.
