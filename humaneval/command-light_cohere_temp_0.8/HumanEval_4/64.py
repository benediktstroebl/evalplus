Here is a Python script that defines a function mean_absolute_deviation which takes a list of numbers and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation value for the list:

```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ 
    Calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) value for a given list of input numbers. 
    The MAD is the average absolute difference between each 
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case). 
    """
    return sum((x - numbers[len(numbers) / 2]) ** 2) / len(numbers)
```

This function uses the Python sum() function to calculate the sum of squared differences from the mean of the list to the element at the same index. The function then divides this result by the length of the list to return the Mean Absolute Deviation value.
