    assert mean(numbers) == mean_absolute_deviation(numbers), "Mean and MAD do not match!"
    assert mean_absolute_deviation(numbers) == math.orship(numbers), could be used as a better way to test the correctness of the mean_absolute_deviation function.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]

```

The script defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` which calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of a dataset. The function then passes the tests by comparing the mean of the dataset with the expected mean of the output of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function. The function `mean` calculates the mean of a dataset and the `test_mean_absolute_deviation` function tests the `mean_absolute_deviation` function with a sample of numbers.
