```python
from typing import List
import math


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    Calculates Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a given list of numbers.
    MAD = average | x -x_mean |
    Where x is each element in the list and x_mean is the mean of the dataset.
    """return math.sqrt(sum(i=len(numbers))/ len(numbers) )**2
```
This function takes a list of numbers as an argument and calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for that list. It does this by finding the mean of the dataset and calculating the average absolute difference between each element and the mean.
