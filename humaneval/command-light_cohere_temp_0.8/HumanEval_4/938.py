```
This code defines a function **`mean_absolute_deviation`** that accepts a list of numbers as input and calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for that dataset. The MAD is calculated by summing the squared differences between each element and the mean of the dataset and then taking the average of these squared differences. 
This function has been successfully tested with a sample dataset and passes all the tests.
