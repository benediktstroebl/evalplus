Here's a self-contained Python function that calculates and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a list of input numbers:
```python
from typing import List
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    # Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    mad_value = math.mean(numbers)
    mad = sum((num - mad_value) for num in numbers) / len(numbers)
    return mad
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) value using the math. This formula calculates the matter of taking the mean of the dataset as the centerpoint, and then calculating the average absolute difference between each element and the centerpoint.

The function returns the calculated MAD value, which is a measure of the dispersion or spread of the input dataset around the mean.
