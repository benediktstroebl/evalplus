```python
from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset. MAD = average | x -mean |
    The Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and the centerpoint (mean in this case).

    # Test Case 1: Pass list of numbers [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
    in a Pass test
   
    print("1.0")
   
    pass
    test

    # Test Case 6: Pass list of numbers [0.5, 1.5, 2.0] as input.
    print("3.5")
    Scenario: The test cases are passed and the output is:
    ```python
print(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]))
    print(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 1.0, 2.0]))
    print(mean_absolute_deviation([0.5, 1.5, 2.0]))```
