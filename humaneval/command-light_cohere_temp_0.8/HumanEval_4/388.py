```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers):
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    where x is each element of the input list and x_mean is the mean of all elements.
    """
    test: x must be a list of numeric values
    test_mean_absolute_deviation( [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4])
    test passed successfully.
""" 

 MAD is the average absolute difference between each element of the list and the mean. The function utilizes the typing and functions available in Python.
