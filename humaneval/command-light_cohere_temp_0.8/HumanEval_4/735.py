Here's the solution to the prompt:
```python
from typing import List
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ 
    Compute the Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset. 
    MAD = average | x - - x_mean |
    For array type x: 
    1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4, 
        Algorithm: 
    https://www. optionally the following formula to compute MAD:
    MAD = math.sqrt((x.mean(x_x - - mean(x) - x_mean)^2)
    """

This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation around the mean of the dataset.
