Here's the solution to the problem:

```python
from typing import List
import math


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ Calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of this dataset.
    MAD = average | x -x_mean |
    """

    numbers_mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    mad = average | math.sqrt(mean - numbers[i] - numbers_mean) |
    return mad
```

This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) around the mean of the dataset. It is a first, the mean of the dataset is calculated using the sum and len of numbers. Then, the average is calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the difference between each element and the mean. Finally, the MAD is calculated by taking the average of the absolute differences between each element and the mean.
