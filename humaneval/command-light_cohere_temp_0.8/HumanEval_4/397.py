```python
from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    # Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    MAD = sum((x-mean) ** 2 for x, mean in zip(numbers, numbers[-mean:0]))) ** (0.5 / 2)
    value 
    # MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    MAD = sum((x-mean) ** 2 for x, mean in zip(numbers, numbers[-mean]))) ** (1 / 2)
    return MAD
``` 
The provided code defines a Python function `mean_absolute_deviation` that computes the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers. This function takes a major list of numbers as an argument and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation value. 

Note: The MAD is calculated using the standard Euclidean distance formula for two points `(x, y)` and the mean of the data point `(mean)`. The formula uses the `sum` function to add up the squared differences between each data point and the mean, then takes the square root of this sum to get the MAD value.
