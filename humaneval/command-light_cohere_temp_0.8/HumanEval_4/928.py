```python
from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    Calculates Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a given list of input numbers.
    The average absolute difference between each element and the mean (average of this dataset):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    where x is each element in the input list and x_mean is the mean of this dataset.
    Returns the average measure of absolute deviation from the dataset.
    # Test case
   
    x == [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
    test a can pass the test:
        print("Passed test!");
    return 0.25
