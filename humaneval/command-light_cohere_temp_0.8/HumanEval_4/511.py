Here's the self-contained Python script:
```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    Mean Absolute Deviation
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    where x_mean = mean(numbers)
    return MAD

def mean(numbers: List[float]):
    average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
numbers. import numpy as np
array = np.random.randint(1, 1 <= numbers.n //sum(numbers) <= 1, 20)
return np.array([numbers[array])[0].sum()

def test_mean_absolute_deviation():
    assert mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4]) == 0.00001
0
    assert mean_absolute_deviation([5, 2, 8, 1]) == 0.500002
   ONE
   assert mean_absolute_deviation([1.0,2.0,3]) == 1.000001
   0
   l

test_mean_absolute_deviation()
```
This script defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a given list of numbers. The function uses the sum of the absolute differences between each element in the list and the mean of the list as its calculation. 

The function also includes a helper function `mean` that calculates the mean of a list of numbers, and another helper function `nparray` that generates a random float between 1 and 20 that satisfies the `numpy` input constraint. The `test_mean_absolute_deviation` function tests the `mean_absolute_deviation` function by passing a list of numbers [1.0, 2, 3] and expecting the MAD to be 0.001000.
