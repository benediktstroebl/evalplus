Here's the solution to the problem:

```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    # Calculate the mean of the dataset
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the average absolute deviation
    mad = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)
    
    return mad
```

This script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation. The function calculates the using a mean of the input list and then calculates the average absolute deviation, which is the average of the squared differences between each element and the mean.

Finally, the function returns the calculated MAD value.

This solution demonstrates the use of the `typing` module to provide type hints and better code documentation and also follows the PEP 8 guidelines for Python code quality.
