```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers):
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset. MAD = average | x -
    MAD = sum(1.0/abs(x -x_mean)) / len(numbers)
    return MAD
```
This code defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of the dataset. It then returns the value of the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD).
