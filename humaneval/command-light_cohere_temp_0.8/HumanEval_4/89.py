Here's a self-contained Python script that solves the provided problem:

```python
from typing import List
import math
def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]):
    """
    For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    MAD = average | x -x_mean |
    where x is each element in the list and x_mean is the mean of all numbers.
    >>>
    test:
    import math
    import numpy as np
    numbers = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    x_mean = sum(numbers)/len(numbers)
    print( MAD(numbers) == math.abs(x_mean -range(numbers - x_mean)) )
    """

The function takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the mean absolute deviation. The function first computes the range of each number in the list and then computes the mean of this range. The function then calculates the range of the difference between each element in the list and the mean.
