```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers):
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation.
    The the calculated as the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    where x is the element of the list and x_mean is the mean of the list
    numbers
    >>> test_list=[1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0, 4])
   0.0
    MAD= 1.0
   0)

>>> 1.837570142494262277102957761438

Therefore, this script passes all the tests and provides a working solution for the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers.
