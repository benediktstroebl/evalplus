Here's the solution:

```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of this dataset.
    # Here, MAD is the average of the absolute value of the difference between each element and the mean.
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    mad = sum(abs(num - mean) for num in numbers) ) / len(numbers)
    return mad

# Unit tests
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
test_mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)
assert (mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]) == 0.25
print("Passed all tests!")
```

This code defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that computes the Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of a dataset. It then performs unit tests using the function to ensure its correctness. The output will be printed to the console.
