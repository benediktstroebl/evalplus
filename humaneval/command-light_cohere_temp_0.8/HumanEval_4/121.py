Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you've described:
```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers):
    # Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of this dataset
    mad = numbers[::mean(numbers)]
    mad_abs_deviation = sum((x - mad) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)
    return mad_abs_deviation

# Example usage:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))  # Expected Output: approximately 1.71)
```
This script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a given list of numbers. The function then uses the type hint `List` to receive the input array and returns the calculated MAD value. 

The output of the function is then tested with an example, and the output is printed.
