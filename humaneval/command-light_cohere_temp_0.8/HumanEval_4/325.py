Here's the solution:
```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of this dataset.
    MAD = average | x - the mean |
    """
    # Code for calculating the mean of the dataset
    x_mean = sum(numbers)/len(numbers)
    # Code for calculating the absolute value of the difference between each element and the mean of the dataset
    MAD = sum((x-x_mean)**2) / len(numbers)
    return MAD
```

This script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation. The MAD is calculated using the sum of squared differences from the mean, divided by the length of the input list.
