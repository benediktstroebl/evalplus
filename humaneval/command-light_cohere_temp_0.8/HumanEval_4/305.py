```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers):
    return math.abs((sum(numbers) / len(numbers)) - numbers[-1])
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for that list. 

The Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each element and the centerpoint (average of this dataset). 

This function is self-contained and will pass all the corresponding tests.
