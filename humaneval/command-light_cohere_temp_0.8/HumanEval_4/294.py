Here is a Python script that solves the problem you have described:
```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers):
    """
    For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation. This is Madeline Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    where x is each element in the list and x_mean is the mean of the numbers in the list.
>"""
    x_mean = numbers.mean()
    calculate the multi_range, linearly, the average absolute deviation.
    MAD = sum((x -max((x - x_mean), 0.0)  ) / len(numbers)
    return MAD
```
This script defines a function mean_absolute_deviation that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation of this list, calculated as the average absolute deviation of the list elements from the mean of the dataset.
