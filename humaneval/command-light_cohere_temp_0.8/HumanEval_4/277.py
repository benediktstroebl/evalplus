In this script, we have a self-contained function `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation, which is the average absolute difference between each element in the list and the mean. The function uses the sqrt(2) algorithm to calculate the difference between each element and the mean, and then sums up the squared differences to get the MAD.

The function has been tested with four test cases, and the results have been printed out. The tests passed without any assertion.
