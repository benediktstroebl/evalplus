Here's a Python script that implements the `mean_absolute_deviation` function, which computes the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ 
    Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation for the given dataset 
    around the mean of this dataset. 
    MAD = average | x -x_mean |
    """
    # Initialize variables
    x, mean = , float(sum(numbers)/len(numbers))
    MAD = sum([abs(x-mean)]) / len(numbers)
    return MAD
```
This function takes a list of numbers and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for that list, calculated around the mean of the dataset.
