Here's a self-contained Python function that calculates and prints the mean absolute deviation:

```python
def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers):
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculates Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.

    :mean_absolute_deviation()
    takes a list of numbers as an argument, and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation as a float value.
    The function first calculates the mean of the numbers in the list, then it calculates the average absolute difference between each element and the mean.
    then it returns the expected result, the Mean Absolute Deviation. 
```
You can use this function with any list of numbers to get the mean absolute deviation.
