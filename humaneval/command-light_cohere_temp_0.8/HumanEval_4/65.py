This script defines a function called **mean_absolute_deviation** that takes a list of numbers as input. It computes the multimedia group audience (MMA) for the given list of numbers by determining the average of the absolute differences between each number and the mean.

The script then passes this **MMA** calculation to the **mean_absolute_deviation** function and returns the result.
