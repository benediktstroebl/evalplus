```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    # Calculate the mean of the input dataset
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the average absolute difference between each element and the mean
    mad = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)
    
    return mad

# Example usage
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))
```
This code defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that computes the Mean Absolute Deviation of a given list of numbers. The MAD is calculated using a specialized formula which takes into account the central point of the dataset.

The provided example usage demonstrates how to call this function with a list of numbers [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0] and prints thel out the expected output.
