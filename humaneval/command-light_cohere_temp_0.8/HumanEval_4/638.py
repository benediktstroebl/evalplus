This Python script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation of a list of numbers around the mean of the dataset. It takes a input list of numbers and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation value. The function uses the mathematical operations such sum and length of the list to calculate the mean of the dataset and the absolute values of the differences from the mean for each element in the list, respectively.

The function is then tested with a sample list of numbers [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0] and the fact that be the output of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function. The correct output will be 1.257220, which is the Mean Absolute Deviation of the input list.
