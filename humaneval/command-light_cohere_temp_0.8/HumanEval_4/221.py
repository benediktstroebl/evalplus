```python
from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of this dataset """
    mad = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x, mean in zip(numbers + [sum(numbers)]) / (numbers + [sum(numbers)])) / 2)
    return mad / len(numbers) if len(numbers) > 0 else float("Mean Absolute Deviation is undefined!")
