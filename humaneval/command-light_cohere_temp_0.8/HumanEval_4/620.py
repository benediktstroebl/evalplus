Here is a Python script that includes a self-contained function to calculate the mean absolute deviation (MAD) for a given list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List
import math
def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of this dataset
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    x = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
   1.0
   0
    report list that the numbers in a list, then calculate the mean of this dataset
    and store it in the variable x_mean. Then, for each element x in the list, calculate the absolute value of the difference between this element and the centerpoint (mean) and store it in the variable `x - x_mean`. Finally, add all these differences together and divide by the number of elements in the list to get the Mean Absolute Deviation.
    return math.abs((x wouldâ€‹ analytical solution of MAD for a given list of numbers)
``` 
This function is a self-contained way to solve the problem of calculating the Mean Absolute Deviation in markdown code.
