This script defines a function mean_absolute_deviation that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation as output. 

The function first calculates the mean of the numbers and stores it in the variable mean. Then, it creates a list of the mean of each number in the list and the mean itself, and the sum of the absolute differences is divided by the length of the list.

This function passes all tests as the output is the expected output.
