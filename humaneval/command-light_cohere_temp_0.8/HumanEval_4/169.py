Here is a Python script that solves the problem of calculating the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a list of numbers and passes the given tests:

```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation = average | x - x_mean |
    """
    # Calculate mean of the dataset
    x_mean = sum(numbers)/len(numbers)
    # Create a list that contains the mean and all values in the original list
    x_values = [x_mean, *numbers]
    # Calculate the absolute deviation of each value from the mean
    results = [abs(x - x_mean) for x in x_values]
    # Return the average of the absolute deviations
    return sum(results) / len(numbers)
```
This script calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a given list of input numbers, around the mean of the dataset. It uses the result variable to store the average of the absolute deviations of each element from the mean, and then returns the average of these absolute deviations.
