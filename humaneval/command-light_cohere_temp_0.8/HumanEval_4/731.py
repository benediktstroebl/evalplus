```
This Python code defines a self-contained function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of this dataset. 

The function computes the sum of the absolute differences between each element and the mean of the dataset, divided by the total number of elements.

The code also includes unit, dictionary, and assertion tests to verify the functionality of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function.
