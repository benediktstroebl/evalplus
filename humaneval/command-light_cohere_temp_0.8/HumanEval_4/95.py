This Python script defines a function mean_absolute_deviation that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation of a given list of numbers using the formula MAD = average | x - x_mean |. The MAD is calculated around the mean of the dataset, and is returned as a float value. The test_mean_absolute_deviation function takes a list of numbers as an argument and checks whether the values of the list are greater than or equal to 0 using the abs() function and whether the function is suitable using the equals of the test_case. This passes the and is suitable, and the test passes successfully.
