Here is a self-contained Python function that calculates and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a given list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ 
    Calculates Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a given list of input numbers.
    MAD = average | x -x_mean | 
    where x is each element in the input list and x_mean is the mean of this dataset.
    Returns the mean mean of the list calculated using the mean as the centroid and then takes the absolute value of each distance from the mean to find the average absolute deviation.
    """ return float( MAD )
```
This function uses the Mean Absolute Deviation formula, which calculates the average absolute difference between each element and the mean.
