```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers):
    """
    For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset. MAD is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    return MAD
```
