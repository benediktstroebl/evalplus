Here is a Python script that solves the problem of calculating the mean absolute deviation (MAD) for a given list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ 
    Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset. 
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    
    For a given list of input numbers, 
    calculate Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of this dataset. 
    MAD = average 
    """ 
    For a list of numbers [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, MAD = 
    sum((x-x_mean)**2) / len(numbers)
    
    >> return MAD 
    """ 
    return float(sum((x-mean)**2 / len(numbers)))
```
