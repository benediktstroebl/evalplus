This Python script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation`, which takes a list of numbers as input. It then calculates the calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) around the mean of the dataset, which is the average absolute difference between each element and the mean. The function then passes the test `test_mean_absolute_deviation` to verify its correctness.
