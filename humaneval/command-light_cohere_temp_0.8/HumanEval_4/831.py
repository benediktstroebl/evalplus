``` 
This code defines a function mean_absolute_deviation that computes the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a list of numbers. It also defines a function mean, which computes the mean of a list of numbers. Finally, the function test_mean_absolute_deviation takes a list of numbers as input and passes the test. 

Note that this solution uses the built-in function mean to calculate the mean of the input list, and then computes the Mean Absolute Deviation by taking the absolute difference between each number and the mean.
