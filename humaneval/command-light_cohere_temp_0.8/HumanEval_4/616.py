Here's the solution:

```python
from typing import List
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    Mean Absolute Deviation
    Calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of this dataset.
    MAD = math.sqrt(sum((x -((x - x_mean) for x, x_mean in zip(numbers, numbers. average mean)))
    return MAD
```

This function uses the mean calculation and the sum of absolute differences to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation. It then returns the

Here's the test code:

```python
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
result = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)
```

This would output the value of the Mean Absolute Deviation. 

Note: This solution is a self-contained Python script, meaning that it contains all the functionality required to solve the problem.
