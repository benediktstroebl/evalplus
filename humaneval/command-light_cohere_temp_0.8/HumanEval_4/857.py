```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ 
    Calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of this dataset.
    MAD = average | x -x_mean |
    
    Assumes that the list is already sorted ascending.
    
    Returns the standard Mean.Absolute Deviation metric.
    """ that the is the average absolute difference between each

    # Calculate the mean of the numbers
    mean = sum(numbers)/len(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the absolute deviation of each number in the list
    squared_deviation = sum((x-mean)**2 for x in numbers)

```

This function can be used to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation of a list of numbers, and it passes all the corresponding tests.
