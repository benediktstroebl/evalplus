Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    where x is the current element of the list and x_mean is the mean of the list.
    return value of 0.0 """
