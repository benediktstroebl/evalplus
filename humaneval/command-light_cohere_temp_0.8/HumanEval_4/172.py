Here's the solution:
```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    Mean Absolute Deviation.

    Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation, which is the average absolute difference between each element and the mean in the list.
    """

    numbers = sorted(numbers)
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    mad = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)
    return mad
```

This script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` which takes a list of numbers as input and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation. It then sorts the to arrange the input list in ascending order, and calculates the mean of the numbers. The function then calculates the MAD which is the average of the squared differences between each element in the list and the mean.

The output of this code is the function.  This can be used in a markdown code block.
