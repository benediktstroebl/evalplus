```python
from typing import List
import math
def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers):
    """ 
    For a given list of input numbers, calculates Mean Absolute Deviation 
    around the mean of this dataset.
    MAD = average | x -x_mean |
    """
    numbers.mean = sum(numbers)/len(numbers)
    mad = sum((x-numbers.mean) **x x.mean)
   :x
    sum(numbers)
    return mad
``` 
This solution computes the Mean Absolute Deviation around a dataset's mean value.  The approach involves computing the average of the absolute differences between each element and the mean.
