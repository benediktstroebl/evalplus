This code is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of calculating the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a given list of numbers and passes the corresponding tests. The function takes a input list of numbers and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of the dataset. The function then first defines a new function to calculate the mean of the input list, and then uses this function to calculate the mean of the numbers in the list.
