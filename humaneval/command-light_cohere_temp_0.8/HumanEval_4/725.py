Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of calculating the mean absolute deviation (MAD) for a given list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ 
    Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of this dataset.
    MAD = average | x -x_mean |
    Where x is each element in the list and x_mean is the mean of the list.
    Test Case
    x == numbers[0]
    Test Case:
    MAD = 0.0 | 3.0 - 3.0 | failed to pass 
    Test
    mean_absolute_deviation([3.0, 3.0, 4.0])
   1.0)
   `

The test case failed.
""" 
 MAD = 0.0
    for x in numbers:
        if x == numbers[0]:
            continue
        MAD = MAD + (x - numbers[0]) ** 2
    return MAD
``` 
This script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes a list of numbers as input. It then iterates through each element in the list, and if the element is equal to the first element in the list, it continues to the next iteration. If the element is not equal to the first element, it calculates the squared difference between the element and the first element, and adds it to the Mean Absolute Deviation. 
Finally, it returns the Mean Absolute Deviation.
