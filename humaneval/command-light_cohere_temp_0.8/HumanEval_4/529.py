```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]):
    """
    For a given list of input numbers, calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of this dataset.
    MAD = average | x - - x_mean |
    Where:
        - MAD is Mean Absolute Deviation.
        - x is list of numbers.
    This can be used to test the validity of the function with the following input:
    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
    expected
   -  1.0 
    3.0  #3.0  expected 3
    specific to all input you have, pass the input to the function and check if it gives the expected output. 
``` 
This code defines a function that takes a list of numbers as an input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the list, which is a measure of the average absolute difference between each element of the list and the mean. 
The function uses the mean absolute deviation formula to calculate the mean absolute deviation. 
Note that the function is designed to be a self-contained solution for the problem, meaning that it does not require any additional variables or functions to be passed into it as input.
