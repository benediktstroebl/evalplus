This Python script defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that computes the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a given list of numbers. The MAD is calculated by taking the absolute difference between each element and the mean of the dataset, and then taking the average of these absolute differences. 

The script then passes the function to a test with a sample list of numbers and prints out the result. 

This provides a way to compute MAD for a dataset of numbers, and passes the test.
