This script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation`, which computes the mean absolute deviation of a given list of numbers. The MAD is calculated by taking the absolute difference between each element and the mean of the dataset and then taking the average of these differences. The function is tested using a list of numbers and passes the test with the expected result.
