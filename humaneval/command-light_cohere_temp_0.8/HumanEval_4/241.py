Here's a solution:

```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]):
    return math.abs(sum([x - numbers[:-1] ] / len(numbers)) - numbers[-1])
```
This function computes the Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of a dataset. The algorithm first calculates the differences between each number and the mean, then it sums these differences up and divides by the number of elements. This process calculates the string differences between the numbers and the mean. The function then subtracts the number at the end of the list to get the last element's absolute difference.
