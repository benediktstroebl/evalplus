Here's a solution to the problem:

```python
from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    # Center the data around the mean.
    mean = sum(numbers)/len(numbers)
    x = List(numbers)
    x.sort()
    numbers.sort()
   the_center a numbers.max  #.5)
   1: 0
    mean = sum(numbers)/len(numbers)
    MAD = 0
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        MAD += abs(x[i]-mean)
    return MAD
```

This function takes a list of numbers as an input and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD). The script sorts the numbers in ascending order, finds the maximum value in the list, and then uses this maximum to be the center of the data points. The script then sorts the numbers again and calculates the sum of the absolute differences between each number and the mean.

The MAD value is then returned as the output of the function.

This solution is self-contained and provides the MAD value for a given list of numbers. The output of the function is a float value that is the Mean Absolute Deviation for the input list of numbers.
