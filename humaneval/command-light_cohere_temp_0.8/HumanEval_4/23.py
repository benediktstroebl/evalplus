    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each element and the mean of this dataset.

The code defines a function mean_absolute_deviation that takes a list of numbers and returns the mean absolute deviation as a float value.  The mean absolute deviation is calculated by finding the average of the absolute differences between each element and the mean of the dataset.
