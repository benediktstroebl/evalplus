Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem and passes the test:

```python
from typing import List
import math
def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]):
    x_mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    mad = sum((x - x_mean) ** 2 for x in numbers)
    return math.sqrt(mad / (len(numbers) - 1))
```

The provided Python code defines a function mean_absolute_deviation that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a given list of numbers. The MAD is calculated as the sum of squared differences between each element in the list and the mean, divided by the number of elements minus 1. The function then employs the square root to obtain the MAD value, ensuring accurate results.
