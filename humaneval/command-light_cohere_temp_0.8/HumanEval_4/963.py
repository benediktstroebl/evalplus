The following test can be used to evaluate this function:
    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4])
   4.0
   
    print("Output: %.2f")
```

In this test, we calculate the mean absolute deviation for a list of numbers [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4]. The output is 4.0. It passes the test test test case because the following outputs are the same:

| Output:  4.0 
| MAD = average | x - x_mean | = average | [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4] - [1.0, 2.0, 3] | = 4.0 
same.
