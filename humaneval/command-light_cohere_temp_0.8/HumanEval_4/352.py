Here is a Python script that includes a self-contained function with a valid implementation for calculating Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD):

```python
from typing import List
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) ->
  mean = sum(numbers)/len(numbers)
  mad = sum((x-mean)**2 for x in numbers) / 2
  return math.sqrt(mad)
```

This function computes the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a given list of numbers. It is a self-contained function, meaning it doesn't require any other functions or modules to be called. The function is designed to be self-contained and can be easily tested to ensure it works correctly.
