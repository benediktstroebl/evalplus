Here's a solution to the problem:

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers):
    """
    For a given list of input numbers, calculates Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of this dataset.
    MAD = average | x - - x_mean |
    """
    numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
   
   
    calculate the MAD, we will take the average of all numbers and then take the absolute difference between each element and the center point (mean).
We can verify that this works by executing the following Python code:

numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]

print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers) == 0.0)
