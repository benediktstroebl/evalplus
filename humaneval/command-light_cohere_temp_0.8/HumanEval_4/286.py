Here's the solution to the problem, implemented as a self-contained Python function that calculates Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD):
```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    # Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    mad = sum(num | abs(num - mean) for mean, num in zip(numbers, numbers.
    statistics)) / len(numbers)
    return mad

# Test cases
test_cases = [ [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], [ float]

print(mean_absolute_deviation(test_cases)))
```
The script defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes a list of numbers as an input and calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of the dataset. The MAD is then the average of the absolute difference between each element and the mean, divided by the total number of elements. The test cases are a list of test values, and the function is then called with this list to verify the correctness of the function.
