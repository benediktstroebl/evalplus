Here's the solution:
```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of this dataset
    The MAD is the average absolute difference between each element and the centerpoint (mean).
    This function utilizes the mean and each number in the list.
    Calculate the average of absolute differences, 
    then divide by the length of the list to obtain the Mean Absolute Deviation.
    Return the result of the mean absolute deviation
    """
    mean = sum([abs(num - mean) for num in numbers]) / len(numbers)
    return mean
``` 
This solution takes a list of numbers, computes the Mean Absolute Deviation, which is the average of the absolute differences between each element and the mean, and then returns the MAD value.
