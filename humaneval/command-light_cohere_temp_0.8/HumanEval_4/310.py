Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) problem for a given list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ 
    Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of this dataset. 
    MAD = average | x -x_mean | 
    where x is each element of the list and x_mean is the mean of the list
    """ 
    return round(sum(map(lambda x: abs(x - numbers[-1]))) / len(numbers) , 4)
```
This code calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation, which is the average absolute difference between each element and a centerpoint (the mean in this case). 

It uses the sum function to calculate the sum of the absolute differences, then divides it by the length of the list to get the Mean Absolute Deviation.
