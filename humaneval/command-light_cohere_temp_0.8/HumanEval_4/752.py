Here's the solution:

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers):
    # Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    mad = sum([(x - mean) ** 2 for x, mean in zip(numbers, numbers[::mean])) ** 0.5 / len(numbers)
    return mad

This Python function, mean_absolute_deviation, takes a list of numbers as input and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of this dataset. It uses the standard Python type hint (List[float]) to indicate that the input is a list of floating-point numbers. It calculates the using the other elements in the input list and then calculates the mean of these numbers. Then, it calculates the absolute deviation of each number from the mean by squaring the difference and summing the squared differences. Finally, it divides the sum of squared differences by the number of data points, which gives the Mean Absolute Deviation.
