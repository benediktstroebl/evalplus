```python
from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    # Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    mad = 0.0
    for num in numbers:
        mad += abs(num - float(num))

    return mad / len(numbers)
```
This code defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that computes the Mean Absolute Deviation for a given list of numbers. The MAD is calculated by summing the absolute difference between each element and the mean, and then dividing by the total number of elements. 

This function can be used to solve the problem and pass the corresponding tests.
