```python
from typing import List
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    MAD = average | x -x_mean|
    """ Here is the Python code that defines the function 'mean_absolute_deviation' which calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation for a given list of input numbers. 

It uses the 'List' type for the input parameter 'numbers' and returns a 'float' value representing the Mean Absolute Deviation. The function takes a list of numbers and calculates the average absolute deviation around the mean of this dataset. 

The output is stored in the variable 'MAD' and can be used for further calculations or displayed in the console.
