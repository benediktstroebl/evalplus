```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers):
    """
    For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    return MAD
```

The function `mean_absolute_deviation` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation. The code has a `numbers` parameter which represents a list of numbers to be analyzed, and the function calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of the dataset.
