```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation = average | x - x_mean |
    >>> numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
   
    a Python list comprehension, and use the `zip()` function to solve the problem, which calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation of the input list.

```This is the solution to the problem, which calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation of a list of numbers. The function takes a input as a list of numbers and returns the corresponding Mean Absolute Deviation value. The output of the function is a float that represents the Mean Absolute Deviation of the input list.
