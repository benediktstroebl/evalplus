```python
from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    where x_mean = mean(numbers)
    assert all(y > 0 for y in numbers) or y == 0) or "Input list contains negative numbers"
    assert all(x in numbers) or "Input list is not sorted in ascending order"
    assert len(numbers) == len(set(numbers)) or "Input list has duplicate elements"
    return MAD
```
The function `mean_absolute_deviation` calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of the input dataset. It ensures that the test suite is valid.
