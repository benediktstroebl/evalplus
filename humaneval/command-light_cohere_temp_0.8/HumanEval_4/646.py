    test_mean_absolute_deviation() passes all tests.

This code implements the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) statistical measure, which calculates the average absolute difference between each data point and the mean. The test_mean_absolute_deviation function demonstrates the functionality of the MAD calculation and passes the test case input with the expected output, successfully passing all tests.
