Here's the solution that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation in Python:
```python
from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of this dataset.
    MAD = sum((x - abs(x - x_mean) for x, x_mean in zip(numbers, mean(numbers)))) / len(numbers)
    return MAD

# Test the function
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print("The Mean Absolute Deviation:", mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)) )
```
The function `mean_absolute_deviation` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) value. It uses a`zip` function to calculate the mean of the numbers, and then iterates over the list and calculates the absolute difference between each element and the mean.

The test code then creates a list of numbers and passes it to the function to calculate the MAD value.
