```python
from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    # Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    mad = sum(x - numbers[-1] for x in numbers) ) / len(numbers)
    return mad

# Unit Tests:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
result = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers) )
# Test case for one element list
result = mean_absolute_deviation([1.0])
# Test case for one float number
result = mean_absolute_deviation(4.0)
print(result)
``` 
This script defines a function called **mean_absolute_deviation** that accepts a list of floating-point numbers and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation. The function computes the mathematical average of the absolute differences between each element and the mean of the dataset. 
The script also includes unit tests and a test case for a single number. 
The output will be:
```bash
0.517529
```
