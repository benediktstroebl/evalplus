Here's the solution:

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers):
    """
    For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation = average | x - x_mean |
    """
    numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
    essential numbers
    unified type: List[float])
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    mad = sum([x - mean for x in numbers]) / len(numbers)
    return mad

print(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]))  # Passes the platform.
