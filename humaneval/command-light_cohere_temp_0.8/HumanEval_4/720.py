Here is a self-contained Python function that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    # Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    MAD = sum(abs(x - numbers[-1])) / len(numbers)
    return MAD

# Test the function with a sample list of numbers
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print("The Mean Absolute Deviation is:", mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))
```
This function utilizes the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) formula, which computes the average absolute difference between each element and the mean of the dataset. It returns the result which can be used to analyze and compare the performance of different algorithms or techniques.
