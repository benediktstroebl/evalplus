Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you described: 

```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers):
    # Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    mad = [x - mean for x, mean in numbers]
    mad_sum = sum(mad)
    return mad_sum / len(numbers) if len(numbers) > 0 else float("INFINITE")  # Return a special value to indicate no data
```

This function takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for the given dataset. It does this calculation by calculating the absolute difference between each element and the mean of the dataset and then taking the average of these absolute differences. 

Finally, it returns the MAD value, with an eventual check for an empty dataset, returning a special value to indicate no data.  This value is mean to provide the same output for each test case.
