This Python code defines a function mean_absolute_deviation that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a given list of numbers. It also includes two test functions: test_mean_absolute_deviation tests the mean_absolute_deviation function with a sample input list, and test_single_number tests the function with a single number. 
These functions demonstrate how to calculate and validate the Mean Absolute Deviation using the provided code.
