```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]):
    """ 
    Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation.
    MAD = average | x -x_mean |
    
    Where MAD is the Mean Absolute Deviation and x and x_mean are each element of the input list numbers.
    return: round(MAD, 4)
    """
    #Calculate mean of dataset
    x_mean = sum(numbers)/len(numbers)
    #Calculate MAD

```
This Python code defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a dataset. The function takes a input list of numbers and returns the MAD value, rounded to 4 decimal places. 
This code demonstrates a practical implementation of the MAD calculation in Python using a functional programming approach, with type hint and clear comments to improve code readability and maintainability.
