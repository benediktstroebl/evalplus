Here's the code:
```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset
    
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    
    where x is each element in the input list and x_mean is the mean of the numbers
    
    This function uses the Mean Absolute Deviation formula to calculate the MAD.
    It then returns the raise an error if the input is not a list, or if any element in the list is not a float.
```

You can use this function in your markdown code block to solve for the Mean Absolute Deviation.
