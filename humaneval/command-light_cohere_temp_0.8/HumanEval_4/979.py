This Python script defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation`, which accepts a list of numbers as input and calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation. The function begins by sorting the input list in ascending order using the `sort` method with the `ascending` argument set to `True`. Then, it calculates the mean of the numbers in the list using the `sum` function and the `len` of the list. Finally, the function initializes the variable for Mean Absolute Deviation using the formula: `MAD = 0.0 * sum(abs(numbers[i] - x_mean)) / len(numbers)`.  This formula calculates the sum of the squared differences between each number and the mean. 
The function returns the final Mean Absolute Deviation value.
