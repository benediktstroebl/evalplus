```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]):
    """
    Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of this dataset.
    MAD = average | x -x_mean |

``` 

This code calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) value for a given list of numbers. It computes the using a formula for MAD, which is the average absolute difference between each element and the mean. The function is self-contained as it computes the mean of the numbers and then calculates the MAD using the formula provided. 

Note that the formula for MAD handles negative numbers by taking the absolute value of the difference between each number and the mean. 
The function also uses the `round()` function to round the calculated MAD to the nearest integer value.
