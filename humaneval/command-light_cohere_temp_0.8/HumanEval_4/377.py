Here is a Python script that calculates and prints the Mean Absolute Deviation of a given list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation = average | x - x_mean |
    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
   
print(MAD)
```
This script defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation of this list. The script then passes the test of the function by calculating the Mean Absolute Deviation of the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0] and printing the_out the print("MAD"), which should evaluate to 1.0.
