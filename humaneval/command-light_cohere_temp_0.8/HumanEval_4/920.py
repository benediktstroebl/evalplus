Here's a self-contained Python function that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a given list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List
import math
def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ 
    Calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation for a given list of input numbers.
    The average absolute difference between each element and the mean of this dataset:
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    where x is each element in the list and x_mean is the mean of the list.
    This array_sort() and get the mean, then subtract each number from this mean and square each value.
    return the MAD
    if a list of numbers was passed as the numbers parameter:
    assert isinstance(numbers, List), "Input must be a list"
    assert len(numbers) > 0, "Input list must not be empty"
    return math.abs(sum(numbers[array_sort()][::-1] - numbers[-1])) / len(numbers)
```
This function first sorts the list, then gets the mean, subtracts each element from this mean, and squares each value. Finally, it returns the absolute value of this sum as MAD.
