Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of calculating the mean absolute deviation in a markdown code block:

```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    Mean Absolute Deviation or MAD is calculated by finding the absolute difference between each element and the mean of the dataset, and then taking the average of these absolute differences.
    This x_mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    MAD = sum(x - x_mean) / len(numbers)
    return MAD

# Unit Tests
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)) == 1.0)
numbers = [10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)) == 0.25)
numbers = [5.5, 5.0, 5.5, 5.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)) == 0.0)
numbers = [20.5, 10.0, 30.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)) == 0.2)
numbers = [3.14159265, -, 3.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)) == 0.0)
```

This script defines a function mean_absolute_deviation that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the dataset. It also includes a series of unit tests to validate the correctness of the function.
