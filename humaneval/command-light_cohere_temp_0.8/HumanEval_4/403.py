Here's a solution that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of a dataset:
```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of this dataset.
    MAD = average | x -x_mean |
    where x = list(numbers)[:len(numbers)]
    return MAD
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation. The MAD is calculated by taking the average of the absolute differences between each element and the mean of the dataset.
