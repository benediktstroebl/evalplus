Here's a self-contained Python function that calculates and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a given list of numbers:

```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ 
    Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of this dataset 
    and return it.
    MAD = average | x -x_mean |
    """
    numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
   

    mean the smaller, such list are:
    [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
   
    if the is less, the numbers are sorted in ascending order:
    numbers = sorted(numbers)
    x = numbers[0]
    x_mean = sum(numbers)/len(numbers) MAD = x - x_mean 
    return MAD
```
The function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for that list, calculated using the formula MAD = x - x_mean, where x and x_mean are the central points of the data.
