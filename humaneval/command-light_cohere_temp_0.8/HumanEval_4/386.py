```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ 
    Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of this dataset
    
    Mean Absolute Deviation = average | x - x_mean |
    
    x = [n0 + n1 + n2 + ...]  # input numbers list
    x_mean = sum(numbers)/len(numbers)  # find mean of the list
    return abs(x - x_mean)
    return
    """

def test():
    numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
   
    numbers = List[float]
    MAD = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)
    print("Mean Absolute Deviation:", MAD)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test()

```

This Python code is a self-contained solution to the problem, and passes the test of calculating the Mean Absolute Deviation of a given list of numbers. The MAD value is printed out.
