```python
from typing import List
import math
def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    For a given list of input numbers, calculates Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of this dataset. 
    Returns the - average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    where x_mean = mean(numbers)
    return math.abs(MAD)
```
This script defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) as the output. It uses the mathematical operation to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation, which is the average absolute difference between each element and the mean.
