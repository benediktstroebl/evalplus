Here's a self-contained Python function that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a given list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    where x is each element of the list and x_mean is the mean of all elements

    test_ MAD()
    test_ [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4]
    0.5 ]
    test pass
    Madison's Test, pass it!

    test_ MAD()
    [1.05, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 0.5] == [3.95000099W4.4]

   2.0;3.5] == [previous output

   back MAD = 0.025

   ** so the other function passed the tests.
