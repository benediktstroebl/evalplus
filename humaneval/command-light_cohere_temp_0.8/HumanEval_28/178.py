Here's the improved version of the Python script that solves the given markdown code block problem using a function with comprehensive comments and docstrings:
```python
from typing import List

def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string and return it.
    Args:
    strings (List[str]): A list of strings to concatenate.
    Returns:
    string (str): The concatenated string.
    """
    print("concatenate Function Docstring:", docstring)
    return "".joinjoin(strings)
```
The function concatenate takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string by concatenating the strings in the list. The function is well-documented with docstrings and uses the returns object to provide more detailed comments and ensure that the function does what it is expected.
