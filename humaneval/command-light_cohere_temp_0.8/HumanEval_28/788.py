Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of joining strings in a list into a single string:
```python
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    
    :param strings: List of strings to concatenate
    :type strings: List[str]
    :return: Concatenated string
    """
    if not strings:
        return ""
    return ''.join(strings)
```
This function concatenates a list of strings into a single string, with appropriate type checking and a helpful docstring. The function is self-contained, and does not rely on any external imports or modules. It can be fully tested and is easy to understand.
