Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of concatenating strings in a markdown code block:
```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    Args:
    strings: list of strings to concatenate
    Returns:
    concatenated string
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
```

This script defines a function 'concatenate' which takes a list of strings as an argument and returns the concatenated string.  The function utilizes the can also be called directly with the 'list of strings' passed as an argument to achieve the desired result.
