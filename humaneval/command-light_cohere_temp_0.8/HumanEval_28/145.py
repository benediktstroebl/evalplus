Here's the self-contained Python function that solves the problem of concatenating strings in Markdown format and passes the tests:
```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    Returns: concatenated string
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
```
This code provides a solution to the problem and passes all the test cases.
