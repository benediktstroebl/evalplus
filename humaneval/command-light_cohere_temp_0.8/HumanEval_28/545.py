Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]): 
    return ''.join(''.join(strings))

def test_concatenate():
    assert concatenate([]) == ''
    assert concatenate(['a']) == 'a'
    assert concatenate(['a', 'b']) == 'ab'
    assert concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c']) == 'abc'
```

The code defines the `concatenate` function that takes a list of strings as input and returns the concatenated string. The `test_concatenate` function contains tests that verify the correctness of the `concatenate` function by asserting that its output matches the expected results for specific inputs. 
When you run the code, the tests will pass, confirming the `concatenate` function's correctness.
