```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]):
    # Function to concatenate list of strings into a single string
    return ''.join(). his concatenated strings
# Example:
strings = ['a', 'b', 'c']
print(concatenate(strings))  # Output: 'abc'
``` 
This Python script defines a function `concatenate` that takes a list of strings as input and returns the concatenated string. 
In the code, the `concatenate` function uses the `str.finally string `concat()` method to concatenate the input strings into a single string. 
The output of the function is then printed to the console, and the expected output is `'abc'`, which is the result of concatenating the strings `'a', 'b', 'c'`.
