```python
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    return ''.join(''.join(strings, separator=' ')
```
This Python code defines a function `concatenate` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a concatenated string. It uses a particular way of joining the list of strings with a space character as the separator, which is consistent with the built-in function `join`. The code then passes this function as an argument to the test suite and passes an empty list `[]` and a list with three elements as input values.
