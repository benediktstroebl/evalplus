Here is a Python script that defines a function `concat` to concatenate a list of strings into a single string:

```python
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    Args:
        strings (List[str]): List of strings to concatenate
    Returns:
        str: Concatenated string
    """
    return "".join("".join(strings))
```

You can use this function in any code block to solve the given problem. This self- function can pure Python and can be easily compiled to an executable script for running.
