Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of concatenating strings in a markdown code block:
```python
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string and return it
    """
    return ''.join(strings)  # use string method concatenate
```

This function takes in a list of strings as an argument and returns a concatenated string. It effectively combines all list of strings into a single string using the `join` method, which is a built-in function in Python. This method concatenates all strings into a new string, and then returns it.

This code is self-contained, meaning it can be easily copied and pasted into a Python environment or code editor and does not require external imports or libraries to run.
