Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem of joining strings into a single Markdown code block, and it passes the tests you provided:
```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string

    Args:
        strings (List[str]): List of strings to concatenate

    Returns:
        str: Concatenated string
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
# Example usage
strings = ["a", "b", "c"]
result = concatenate(strings)
print(result)  # Output: 'abc'
```
This code provides a fully self-contained function that takes a list of strings and returns the concatenated string. It successfully handles empty lists, and different string lengths.

Feel free to ask any further questions or for additional help with other Python concepts!
