Here's the provided Python code:
```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    Args:
        strings (List[str]): List of strings to concatenate
    Returns:
        str: Concatented string
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
```

This code defines a function `concatenate` that takes a list of strings as an argument and returns the concatenated string. It does this using the only one string, `''` which is the empty string.
