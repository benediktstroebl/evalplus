Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of concatenating lists of strings and passes the tests:
```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    Args:
        strings: list of strings to concatenate
    Returns:
        Concatenated string
    """
    return "".join(strings)
```
We use the list of strings to create a single concatenated string by using the `join` function.
