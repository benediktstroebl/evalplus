Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of concatenating strings in a markdown code block:
```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    Args:
        strings (List[str]): List of strings to concatenate
    Returns:
        str: Concatenated string
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
```
This code provides a function called concatenate that takes in a list of strings as an argument and returns the concatenated string as a single string.
