Here's the corrected self-contained Python script with the `concatenate` function that passes all the tests:

```python
from typing import List

def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    >>> concatenate([])
    ''
    >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'abc'
    >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c', 'xx'])
    'abcxx'
    """
    if not strings:
        return ''
    return ''.join(strings)
```

This code defines a function `concatenate` that takes a list of strings as input and returns the concatenated string. The code passes all tests by creating lists with various strings and using the `concatenate` function with each list. The output is the expected strings.
