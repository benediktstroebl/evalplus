Here's a self-contained Python script that defines a function `concat` which takes a list of strings and returns a concatenated string:
```python
from typing import List

def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    Args:
        strings: list of strings to concatenate  
    Returns: Concatenated string
    """
    return "".join(strings)

# Test case: Concatenate empty list
print(concatenate([]))  # Output: ""

# Test case: Concatenate list of strings
print(concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c']))  # Output: "abc"
```
This script provides a function `concat` that accepts a list of strings and returns the concatenated string. It is tested by passing the list of strings as an argument and returning its concatenated value. 

The comments and docstrings are also self-contained, providing clear explanations of the purpose and usage of the function.
