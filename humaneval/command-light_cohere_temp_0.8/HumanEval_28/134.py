```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]):
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string """
    return ''.join(''.join(strings)  # type hint and function call, this line is actually just one big string!
```

This script defines a `concat` function that takes a list of strings as an argument and returns a single string by concatenating the strings in the list.

The `concat` function is self-contained because it does not use any external functions, classes, or modules. It also includes a type hint that shows how the expected input parameter should be defined, which improves the clarity and understanding of the function.

This is a simple example of a self-contained function that takes a list of strings as an argument and returns a single string by concatenating them.
