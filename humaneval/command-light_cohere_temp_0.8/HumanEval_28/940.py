Here's a self-contained Python script that defines a function **concatenate** that performs the task of concatenating strings in a markdown code block:
```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    :param strings: List of strings
    :return: Concatenated string
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_strings = [
        "",
        "a",
        "?",
        "# This is a heading",
        "## This is another heading",
    ]
    expected_result = [
        "",
        "a",
        "?",
        "# This is a heading",
        "## This is another heading"
    ]
    for string, expected in zip(test_strings, expected_result):
        got = concatenate(string.split())
        print(f"Expected: {expected}, Got: {got}")
```
The script defines a function **concatenate** that takes a list of strings as input and returns the concatenated string. The function uses the using a list comprehension to split each string into a list of characters, and then joins these characters back together to form the concatenated string. The test strings and the expected results are defined and printed out to compare against the actual results.
