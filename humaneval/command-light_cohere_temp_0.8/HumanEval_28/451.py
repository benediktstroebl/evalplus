```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]):
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    Returns: str - Concatenated string
    """
    return ''.join(strings)

def test_concatenate():
    """
    Test the concatenate function
    >>> concatenate([])
    ''
    >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'abc'
    """
    assert concatenate([]) == ''
    assert concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c']) == 'abc'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_concatenate()
```

I've created a Python script that contains a self-contained function, `concatenate`, which takes a list of strings as an argument and concatenates them into a single string. The function also has corresponding tests to ensure its correctness. The code is organized, well-structured, and follows the best practices of Python programming and type hinting.
