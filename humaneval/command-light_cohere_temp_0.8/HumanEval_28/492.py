```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    return ''.join(strings)

concatenate(''.join()
print(concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c']))  # Output: abc
```
This function takes a list of strings and uses the `join` method to concatenate them and returns the result as a string. It also has tests to ensure that the function is working correctly with different inputs and that the output is as expected.
