Here's the improved Python script with a self-contained function that concatenates strings in a list into a single string, passing all the tests:
```python
from typing import List

def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string.
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
```
Do you need help with anything else?
