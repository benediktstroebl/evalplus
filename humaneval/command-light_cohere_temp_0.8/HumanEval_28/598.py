Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of concatenating a list of strings into a single string:
```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    Args:
        strings: List of strings
    Returns:
        str: Concatented string
    """
    return "".join(strings)
```
This script defines a function `concatenate` that takes a list of strings as input and returns the concatenated string. It uses the  an `return` statement with a list comprehension that creates a new string by appending each string from the input list.
