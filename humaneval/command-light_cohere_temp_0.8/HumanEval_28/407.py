```python
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    Args:
    strings (List[str]): List of strings to concatenate
    Returns:
    str: Concatenated string
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
```

This Python script defines a function called `concatenate` which takes a list of strings as an argument and returns the concatenated string. It uses the str.hile 'join string's are joined with the ''.join() method to concatenate the list of strings into a single string.
