Here's the provided Python code with a self-contained function that solves the problem of concatenating list of strings into a single string:
```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    Args:
        strings: list of strings
    Returns:
        concatenated string
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
```
The function concatenate takes a list of strings as input and returns the concatenated string. The function is tested by passing an empty list and a list with a single string as arguments and the output is the expected string ''.

This code is self-contained and does not require any external imports or modules. It provides a  an elegant and clear solution to the problem.

You can use this function to solve the problem of string concatenation for any given list of strings.
