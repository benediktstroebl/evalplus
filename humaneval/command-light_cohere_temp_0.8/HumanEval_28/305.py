Here's a self-contained Python script that solves the Markdown code block concatenation problem:
```python
from typing import List


def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string.

    :
    String are not empty, return it as the result.
    """
    return "".join(strings)
```
Do you need assistance with anything else?
