```python
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    :param strings: list of strings
    :return: string
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
```
This Python code defines a function called `concatenate` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a concatenated string by using the `join` method. The code is designed to solve the problem of concatenating multiple strings into a single string. The function is self-contained, and it passes all the corresponding tests.
