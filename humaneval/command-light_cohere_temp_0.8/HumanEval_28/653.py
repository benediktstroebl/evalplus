Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of concatenating list of strings into a single string:
```python
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    return "".join(strings)
```

This function takes a list of strings as input and returns a string by concatenating all the strings in the list. The function is self-contained as it uses the built-in function 'str. "()' which returns a using list of strings as an argument and concatenates them into a single string.

This is a simple and clear implementation of the concatenate function that should solve the given problem.
