Certainly! Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of string concatenation in Markdown code blocks:

```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string"""
    return ''.join(strings)
```

This script defines a function called **concatenate** that takes a list of strings as input and returns the concatenated string. The function uses the string concatenation syntax with the **join** function to combine the strings into a single string.
