Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of concatenating list of strings into a single string:
```python
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    return "".join(strings)
```
This code defines a function called `concat` that takes in a list of strings and returns a new string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the list. 

This is a self-contained function, as it does not depend on any other functions and can be used to test its functionality on its own.
