Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of joining strings into a single markdown code block:
```python
def concatenate(strings):
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    Args: strings (List[str]): List of strings to concatenate
    Returns: str: Concatenated string
    """
    return ''.join(strings)

# Unit tests
test_concat = [
    ['', 'a', 'b'],
    ['hello', '#', 'world'],
    ['-', '123', '-'],
    # invalid input
    ['abc', 'def'],
]

# Function call
for test in test_concat:
    assert concatenate(test) == ''.join(''.join(test)
```
The code defines a function **concatenate** that takes a list of strings and concatenates them into a single string. It returns the
 result of the concatenated string. The code also defines a list of test cases **test_concat** to verify the correctness of the **concatenate** function. The test is performed with each test case and the result is compared to the expected concatenated string, which ensures the correctness of the function.
