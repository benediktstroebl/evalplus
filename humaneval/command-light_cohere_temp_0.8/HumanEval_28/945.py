Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of joining an empty list, list of strings, or a list of strings:
```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    # Using string formatting to create the result
    result = ''.join(strings)
    return result
```
This code defines a function called `concatenate` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a concatenated string. The function uses the specific syntax to create a new string by passing the list of strings to the `String` constructor, which will create a new string with the values of the list. 

The function is considered to be self-contained and solve the provided markdown code block's problem of joining strings together.
