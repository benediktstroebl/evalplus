Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of concatenating strings in a markdown code block:
```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    >>> concatenate([])
    ''
    >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'abc'
    >>> concatenate([ 'a', ' ', 'c'])
    'acc'
    >>> concatenate(['http://www. dim', 'co'])
    # Added tests with non-alph strings
    """
    return ''.join(''.join(strings)  # Composes strings and return the result
```

The `concatenate` function takes a list of strings as an input and uses the join() method to concatenate the strings into a single string, with each string separated by a space. The function then returns the string that has been concatenated.
