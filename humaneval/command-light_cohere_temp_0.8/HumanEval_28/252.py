```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    :param strings: list of strings to concatenate
    :return: concatenated string
    """
    return ''.join(strings)

# Sample test cases
strings = ['a', 'bc', '']
result = concatenate(strings)
assert result == 'abc'

strings = ['23', '456']
result = concatenate(strings)
assert result == '23456'

strings = []
result = concatenate(strings)
assert result == ''
```

This Python script defines a function called **concatenate** that takes a list of strings as input and returns the concatenated string. The function utilizes the string concatenation **(''.join(strings)**, which joins all the strings in the list into a single string.

The script also provides several test cases to verify the correctness of the **concatenate** function. The output of these expected results are compared against the actual result using **assert** statements, which verify the integrity of the code.

In this improved solution, the function is self-contained, and it provides a clear and concise way to solve the problem.
