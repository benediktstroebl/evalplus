Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of concatenating strings:
```python
def concatenate(strings):
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    Args:
        strings (List[str]): List of strings to concatenate

    Returns:
        str: Concatenated string
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
```
The function concatenate takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string by concatenating all the strings in the list. The function uses the text method 'join' to combine the strings. The output is then a concatenated string.
