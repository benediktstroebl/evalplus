Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of concatenating strings in a markdown code block:
```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    Args:
        strings (List[str]): List of strings to concatenate
    Returns:
        str: Concatenated string
    """
    return "".join(strings)
```
This script defines a function `concat` that takes a list of strings as input and returns the concatenated string. The `args` parameter helps used in the function signature to inform Python that the parameter is expected to be of type `List[str]`. This way, the code is self-contained and can be easily understood by other developers.
