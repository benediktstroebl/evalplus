Here's a self-contained Python script that defines a function **concatenate** that solves the problem of concatenating list of strings into a single string:
```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    Args:
        strings: List of strings to concatenate
    Returns:
        String with concatenated strings
    """
    return "".join(strings)
```
This script provides a solution to the given problem using a well-structured function with appropriate type hints and argument naming. The function uses the str.join method to create a concatenate list of strings into a single string. The returned value is a string with all elements concatenated.
