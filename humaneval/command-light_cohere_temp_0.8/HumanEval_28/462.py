Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem of concatenating strings in Markdown code blocks:

```python
from typing import List


def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    Returns: str - Concaten result
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
```

This function takes a list of strings as an input and returns a string with the concatenated strings in the list. It does this using the time-tested by returning the 'join' function result.
