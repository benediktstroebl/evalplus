Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of concatenating strings in a markdown code block:
```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    Returns: str - Concaten result
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
```
This script defines a function `concat` that takes a list of strings as input and returns the concatenated string. The code is self-contained within the function and tests the input parameter correctly.
