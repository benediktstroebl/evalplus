Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem of concatenating list of strings into a single string:
```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
# Test cases
strings = []
result = concatenate(strings)
print(result)  # Output: abc

strings = ['a', 'b', 'c']
result = concatenate(strings)
print(result)  # Output: abc

strings = [' '.join(i) for i in range(10)]
result = concatenate(strings)
print(result)  # Output: 000000000... 

strings = ['a', 'b', 'c'] + ['d']
result = concatenate(strings)
print(result)  # Output: acd
```

This script defines a function `concatenate` that takes a list of strings as an argument and concatenates them into a single string. It is then be used as a building block for solving the problem in a markdown code block.
