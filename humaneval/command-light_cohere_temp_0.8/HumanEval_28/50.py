Here's a self-contained Python function that performs the markdown code block concatenation:
```python
def concatenate(strings):
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string and return the result.
    Args:
        strings (List[str]): List of strings to concatenate

    Returns:
        str: Concatenated string
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
```
This function takes a list of strings as an argument and returns a concatenated string by using the `join` method.
