Here's a self-contained Python script that solves the markdown code block concatenation problem:
```python
from typing import List


def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string and returns it.
    """
    string = ''.join(strings)
    return string
```

The code defines a function called **concatenate** that takes a list of strings as input and concatenates them into a single string. It uses the string.

The provided test cases are passed and the function returns the expected results.
