Certainly! Below is a Python script that contains a self-contained function `concatenate()` that solves the problem of joining strings in a given list into a single string:

```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    Args:
        strings (List[str]): List of strings to concatenate

    Returns:
        str: Concatenated string
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
```

In this script, the `concatenate` function takes a list of strings as an argument and uses the `join()` method to concatenate the strings into a single string.
