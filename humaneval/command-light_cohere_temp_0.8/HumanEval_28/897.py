Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of joining a list of strings into a single markdown code block:
```python
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string using markdown syntax
    :param strings: List of strings
    :return: String containing the concatenated markdown code
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
```

This function takes a list of strings as input and returns a string containing the concatenated markdown code. It uses the With concatenate() method to combine the strings, which uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string and join them with a space character (' ') to create the markdown code. 

This function is self-contained and can be used to easily generate the desired markdown code from a list of strings.
