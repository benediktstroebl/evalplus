Here is a Python script that includes a self-contained function, `concat`, which efficiently concatenates a list of strings into a single string:
```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    >>> concatenate([])
    ''
    >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'abc'
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
```
The function concatenates a list of strings into a single string by using the `join` method, which creates a new string by concatenating all the elements of the list. The test cases demonstrate the value of the function and show that it produces the expected output.
