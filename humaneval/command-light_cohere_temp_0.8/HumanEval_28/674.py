```python
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Function to concatenate list of strings into a single string
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
```
 The above code defines a function called concatenate that takes in a list of strings as an argument and then uses the join() method to concatenate those strings into a single string.
