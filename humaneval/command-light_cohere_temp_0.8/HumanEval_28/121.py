```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    return ''.join(strings)
def test_concatenate() -> None:
    assert concatenate([]) == ''
    assert concatenate(['a']) == 'a'
    assert concatenate(['a', 'b']) == 'ab'
    assert concatenate(['a', 'bc']) == 'abc'
```
The code defines a function `concatenate` that takes a list of strings as input and returns the concatenated result as a string. The function uses the's own type hint to show that the input should be a list of strings, and the return type is also a string.

The code also includes a `test_concatenate` function that contains several asserts that check the correctness of the `concatenate` function. The script ensures that the function is working correctly and is producing the expected results for the given inputs.
