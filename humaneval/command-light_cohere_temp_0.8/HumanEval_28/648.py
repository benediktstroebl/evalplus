```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    Args:
    strings (List[str]): List of strings to concatenate
    Returns:
    str: Concatented string
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
```
These two lines are a helpful example of how to implement a function that accepts a list of strings and returns their concatenation as a single string.
