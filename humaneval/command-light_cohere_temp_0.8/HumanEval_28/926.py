Here's the code:

```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    Args:
        strings (List[str]): List of strings to concatenate
    Returns:
        str: Concatenated string
    """
    return "".join(strings)

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    [], # Empty list should return empty string
    ["a", "b", "c"], # Basic concatenation
    ["a", "b", "abc"], # Additional characters
]

for case in test_cases:
    assert concatenate(case) == case[0]
```

This code defines a function `concatenate` that takes a list of strings and concatenates them into a single string. It also comes with a set of test cases to ensure the correctness of the function. The `assert` statements are used to verify if the function is returning the expected output for different inputs.
