```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    return ''.join(strings)
def test_concatenate() -> None:
    assert concatenate([]) == ''
    assert concatenate(['a']) == 'a'
    assert concatenate(['a', 'b']) == 'ab'
    assert concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c']) == 'abc'
```
The provided code has a function **`concatenate`** that takes a list of strings as input and returns their concatenation as a single string. The **`test_concatenate`** function contains several assertions that check the correctness of the **`concatenate`** function by passing different input strings and verifying the expected output. 
The code is self-contained, meaning it can be run independently and does not rely on any external modules or functions.
