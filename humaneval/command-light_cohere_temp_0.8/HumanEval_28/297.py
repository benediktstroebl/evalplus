Here's the self-contained Python function that solves the problem of concatenating strings in a markdown code block:
```python
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    Args:
    strings (List[str]): List of strings to concatenate
    Returns:
    str: Concatenated string
    """
    return ''.join(strings) if strings else ''
```
This function takes a list of strings as input and returns the concatenated string. It uses the str.hile concatenation and are performed, and the empty string is returned if the input is empty.
