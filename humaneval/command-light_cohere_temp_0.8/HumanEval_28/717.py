Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of concatenating strings in a markdown code block:
```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    >>> concatenate([])
    ''
    >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'abc'
    >>> concatenate([â„š, '123'])
    '#$%@'
    """
    return '\n'.join(strings)
```
The function concatenate is a straightforward string concatenation method. It accepts aa list of strings and returns a single string that is formed by joining the input strings together. This method is straightforward and effective, and it is ideal for solving the issue of combining strings in markdown code blocks.
