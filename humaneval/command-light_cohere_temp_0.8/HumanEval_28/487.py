Here's the Python code:
```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    Args:
    strings: list of strings to concatenate
    Returns:
        string
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
```

This code defines a function called `concatenate` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a concatenated string. The function uses the process with the `join()` syntax to call the built-in `join()` function with the strings as arguments and then joins them with a space (' ' ') character. The code also provides an docstring for the function that explains its purpose and usage.

You can use this code in your Markdown code block to solve the problem of concatenating strings.
