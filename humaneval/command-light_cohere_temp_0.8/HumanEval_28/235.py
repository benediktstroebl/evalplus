Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    Args:
        strings (List[str]): List of strings to concatenate
    Returns:
        str: Concaten of strings as a single string
    """
    return "".join(strings)
def test_concatenate():
    assert concatenate([]) == "", "Should return the empty string"
    assert concatenate(["a"]) == "a", "Should return 'a'"
    assert concatenate(["a", "b"]) == "ab"
    assert concatenate(["a", "b", "c"]) == "abc"
```

This code defines a function `concatenate` that takes a list of strings and concatenates them into a single string. It also provides a test case for the function, where the tests cover the expected behavior for different inputs.
