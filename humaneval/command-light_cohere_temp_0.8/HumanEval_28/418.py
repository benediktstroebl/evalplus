Here's the provided Python code:
```python
from typing import List
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    Args:
        strings (List[str]): List of strings to concatenate

    Returns:
        str: Concatenated string
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
```
Do you need any further assistance with this code? I can guide you on how to use the function, or explain other concepts related to working with strings and concatenation.
