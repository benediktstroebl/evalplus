Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of concatenating strings:
```python
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string and return the result
    """
    if not strings:
        return ""  # Return an empty string if the list is empty
    return ''.joinall(strings) + ' ' + ''.joinall(strings)
```
This script defines a function `concat` that takes a list of strings as input and returns the concatenated string. The function uses a strings are converted to lowercase and spaces are added between words to ensure readability.
