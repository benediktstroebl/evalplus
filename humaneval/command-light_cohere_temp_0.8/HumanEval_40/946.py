    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    >>> l=[2,4,-5,3,9]
    return True  # 3 distinct elements sum to zero: 2+4+(-5)=0

    >>> l=[1,2,3]

    >>> l=[1,3,1]
    return False  # Same element, not three distinct elements

    >>> l=[1,2,2,3]
    return False  # Same element, not three distinct elements

    >>> l=[7,2,3,4,5]
    return False  # Not three distinct elements, but has sum zero

    >>> l=[0,0,0]

```
The function checks if a list of integers has three distinct elements whose sum is less than or equal to zero.
