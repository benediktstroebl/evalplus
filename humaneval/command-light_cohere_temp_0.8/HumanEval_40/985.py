```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.
    """
    return sum(set) == 0
```
This function determines whether the sum of three distinct elements in the list equals zero, answering True if it does and False if it doesn't. It accepts a particular list of integers as input and produces a boolean value to demonstrate whether the problem is solvable.
