```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    return sum(x for x in l if len({x, x + 1, x - 1}) <= 2) == 0
```

This function is an implementation of a solution that takes a list of integers as input and returns `True` if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise. The function utilizes a method, a list comprehension, and the `sum()` function to determine if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.
