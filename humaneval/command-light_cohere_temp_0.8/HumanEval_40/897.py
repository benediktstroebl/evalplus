This Python script defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that checks if a list of integers has three distinct elements whose sum is equal to zero. The `test_triples_sum_to_zero` function contains multiple test cases to ensure the correctness of the function.

Let's discuss the code further:
-   The `triples_sum_to_zero` function takes a single argument, which is a list of integers.
-   It checks if the list contains three distinct elements whose sum is equal to zero. If it does, it returns `True`, indicating that it is possible to achieve the sum to zero.
-   The function then uses the `assert` statement to verify if the condition is met.
-   The test cases cover different scenarios, such as lists with zero elements, lists with distinct numbers, and lists with duplicate numbers.

This code is self-contained and provides a clear and efficient way to solve the problem of checking if a list of integers contains three distinct elements whose sum is equal to zero.
