This code defines a function named triples_sum_to_zero that takes a list of integers as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the list contains three distinct elements whose sum is equal to zero. The function sets the variables sum_set and i to represent the sum of the list and the current element respectively. The function then checks if the set is equal to zero, and if so, it returns True, indicating that the list has the required properties. Otherwise, it returns False. 

Note: If the input is not a list of integers, or if the list does not contain three distinct elements, the function will not return True. The tests ensure that the code covers these edge cases.
