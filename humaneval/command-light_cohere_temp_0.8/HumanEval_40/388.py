```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    return any(sum(t) == 0 for t in zip(*l)))

# Test cases
test_suite = [
    [
        [1, 3, 5, 0],
        [1, 3, -2, 1],
        [1, 2, 3, 7],
        [2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7],
        [1]
    ]
test_suite

# Function Call
result = triples_sum_to_zero(test_suite)

# Print Output
print(result)
```
The code defines the function `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as input and returns `True` if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise. The test suite contains several test cases, and the function is called with this test suite. The result is then stored in the variable `result` and printed.
