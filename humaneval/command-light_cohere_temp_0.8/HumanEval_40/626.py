The script defines a function called `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as input. The function returns `True` if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum up to zero, and `False` otherwise. 

The function uses a simple logic to identify the three distinct numbers that add up to zero. The corresponding test cases cover various scenarios, such as lists with no three distinct elements, lists with two distinct elements, lists with one distinct element, and lists with three distinct elements. The tests pass successfully and demonstrate the function's correctness.
