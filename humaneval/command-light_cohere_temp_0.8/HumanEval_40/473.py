This Python script defines a function called triples_sum_to_zero, which takes a list of integers as input and returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero and False otherwise. It employs a double negative check to identify the sum of three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and it uses the any() function with the set data type to check if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.

The test cases are also provided to validate the correctness of the function.
