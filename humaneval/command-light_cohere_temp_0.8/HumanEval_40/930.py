```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst):
    sum_triple = lambda x: x[0] + x[1] + x[2]
    return any(sum_triple(x) == 0 for x in lst)

# Tests
triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])  # True
triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])  # False
triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])  # True
triples_sum_to_zero([1])          # False
```
This Python code defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that checks whether there are three distinct elements in a list that sum up to zero. It does this using a necessary list as input and returns `True` if there are such elements and `False` otherwise. The function uses a simple unit test by checking the sum of each element against zero. 

The `any()` function is used to check for membership, which is much more efficient than iterating over the list.
