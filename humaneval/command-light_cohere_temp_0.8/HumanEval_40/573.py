    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

# Testing function
def test_triples_sum_to_zero():
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]) is False
assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]) is True
assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]) is False
assert triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]) is True
assert triples_sum_to_zero([1]) is False
```
The function checks if there are three distinct elements in the list that their sum is less than or equal to zero, and returns True. If there are not, it will return False.
