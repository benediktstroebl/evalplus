    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.
    """
    function implements a following logic:
    - Initialize variables
    - Sum of the first two elements of the list
    - Compare the sum with the third element's value
    - If the sum is greater than the third element, then the list doesn't have three distinct elements that sum to zero.
    - If triple found? triple found in the list
    - Return True.
    - If triple not found in the list
    - Return False.
    """
The function has been designed to be efficient and handle a wide range of input scenarios.
