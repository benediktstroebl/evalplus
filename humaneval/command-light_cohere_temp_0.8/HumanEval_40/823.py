    """
    sum the all three numbers in a list to check for the sum condition.

    """
    # Initialize sum variable
    sum = 0
    # Initialize counter variable
    cnt = 0
    # Loop through list
    for num in l:
        cnt += 1
        # Check if all elements in the list are added to the sum variable
        if cnt == 3:
            return True
        # Check if the sum is less than 0
        if sum < 0:

        sum += num
    return False
```

This solution is a Python function that checks if a list of integers has three distinct elements whose sum is equal to zero. The function uses a loop to iterate through the list, calculates the sum of the first three elements, and returns True if they add up to zero and False otherwise.
