This code provides a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that checks whether a list contains three distinct elements that sum to zero. The test cases cover different scenarios, such as an empty list, a list with two distinct elements, a list with three distinct elements, and a list with one element. The function returns `True` for the case and `False` otherwise.
