The Python script defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as input and returns `True` if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise. The function uses the `set_3_distinct_sum` to find three distinct integers that sum to zero, and then checks if these three distinct sums equal zero.
