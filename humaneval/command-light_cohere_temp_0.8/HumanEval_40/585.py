``` 
The function takes a list of integers as input and returns `True` if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a exact mathematical logic to solve the problem.

This Python code demonstrates the concept of solving a problem using an effective approach with self-contained logic and passing corresponding tests.
