Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of checking if there are three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero:
```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    return any(sum(x) == 0 for x in l)

# Test the function with several input lists
assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]) == True
assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]) == False
assert triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]) == True
assert triples_sum_to_zero([1]) == False
```
The function uses the `any()` function with `sum()` and a generator expression to efficiently check if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero. 

This function can be used to quickly check if a given list meets the criteria, saving time and improving readability.
