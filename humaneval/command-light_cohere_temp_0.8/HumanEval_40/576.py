```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    A utility function to check if there are three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero.
    Returns: True if it is possible, False otherwise.
    """
   
    list comprehension is used to check if there are three elements in the list that sum to zero, using the equation: 0 <= x + y + z == 0.
    """
    three distinct elements that add up to zero are: x, y, and z.
    """
    Returns True if any such three distinct elements that add up to zero are found in the list, True is returned. 
```

Below are some test cases that demonstrate how to use the `triples_sum_to_zero` function:
```python
# Test case 1
assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]) == False
# Test case 2
assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]) == True
# Test case 3
assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]) == False
# Test case 4
assert triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]) == True
# Test case 5
assert triples_sum_to_zero([1]) == False
```
The function returns `True` if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise.
