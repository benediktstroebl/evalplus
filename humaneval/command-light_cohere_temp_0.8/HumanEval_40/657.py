```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    if not set(l) <= {0,}:
        return True
    return False
```
This Python script defines a function named triples_sum_to_zero that accepts a list l representing a collection of integers. 

The function utilizes a simple yet effective approach to determine whether there exists a triplet sum of three distinct elements from the list that equals zero. 

The core logic of the function revolves around checking if the set of elements in the list, denoted as not set(l), is strictly less than or equal to the set {0}. 

The condition is satisfied when no element in the list sums to zero.
