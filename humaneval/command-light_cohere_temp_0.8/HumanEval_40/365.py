```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    return any(sum(x) == 0 for x in l) and not sum(l)

# Function test
def test():
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]) is True
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]) is True
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]) is False
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]) is True
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1]) is False
```
The provided Python code defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` which aims to determine whether there are three distinct elements in a given list that their sum equals zero. 

The function accepts a input list `l` and returns `True` if it's the case that the sum of any three distinct elements in `l` equals zero, and the sum of the list is not zero otherwise. 

The function is then accompanied by a series of tests, using the `assert` assertion to check its correctness against various input scenarios.
