Here's your improved and simplified code:
```python
def is_sum_three_distinct(lst):
    sum(set(lst)) == 3 and len(set(lst)) == 3
```

This code defines a function `is_sum_three_distinct` that checks whether a list `lst` contains three distinct elements whose sum is equal to zero. The function uses the simple set and sum operations to achieve this. 

This code is self-contained and does not require any external functions or modules. It can be easily understood, and it efficiently checks if a list satisfies the required condition.
