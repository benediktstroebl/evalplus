The provided Python function `triples_sum_to_zero` checks if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero. 

The list comprehension checks if the sum of any element in the list is less than or equal to two, and if the sum of any element greater than two is exactly three. 
The function then returns `True` if both conditions are met, and `False` otherwise. 
The test cases cover various scenarios, and pass the test successfully.
