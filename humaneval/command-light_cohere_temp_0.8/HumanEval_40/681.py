```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    return any(sum(x) == 0 for x in zip(*l)))

# Example usage
triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])  # Output: True
triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])  # Output: False
triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])  # Output: True
triples_sum_to_zero([1])  # Output: False
```
The code defines the function `triples_sum_to_zero`, which accepts a list of integers as an argument and outputs `True` if there are three distinct elements in the list whose sum equals zero, and `False` otherwise.  This basic strategy for identifying such shock points is employed in the function. A list's elements are zipped, and the sum of each pair is computed using the `sum()` function. The function returns `True` if any of these sums are zero, and `False` otherwise.
