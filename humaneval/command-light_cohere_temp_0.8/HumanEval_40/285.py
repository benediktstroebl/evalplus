```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst):
    if sum(map(sum, lst)) <= 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Test the function with provided examples
triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])  # Should return True
triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])  # Should return False
triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])  # Should return True
triples_sum_to_zero([1])  # Should return False
```

This code defines a Python function named triples_sum_to_zero that takes a list lst as input and determines whether there are three distinct elements in the list whose sum is zero. It achieves this by applying a formula to calculate the sum of distinct elements and then checks if the calculated sum is less than or equal to zero.

The function returns True if there are three elements with a sum of zero, indicating that the input list meets the specified criteria. If the sum of the elements is not zero, or if there are not three distinct elements, the function returns False.

The test cases provided in the function call at the end demonstrate the functionality of the function by providing examples that should be evaluated to verify its correctness.
