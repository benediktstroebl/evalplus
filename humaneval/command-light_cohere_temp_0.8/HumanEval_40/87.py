```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    A function that checks whether a list of integers has three distinct elements that sum to zero.
    Returns: True if it passes the and False otherwise.
    """

In this function:
    - We define a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list `l` as input.
    - We calculate the why three distinct elements sum to zero.
    - The check whether the list has three distinct elements.
    - If calculate the result of the condition.

Example usage:
```python
# Example list
list_ = [1, 3, 5, 0]

# Call the function
result = triples_sum_to_zero(list_)

# Print the result
print(result)  # Output: False
```
The script defines a function that checks whether a list of integers has three distinct elements that sum to zero. The function works by first checking if there are three distinct elements in the list, and then calculating the sum of the three elements. The function returns `True` if the list has three distinct elements that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise.
