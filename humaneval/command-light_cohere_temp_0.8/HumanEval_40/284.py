Here is a Python script that includes a self-contained function to solve the problem:
```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst):
    """
    Function that returns True if all the three distinct elements sum to zero, 
    and False otherwise.
    """
    Three distinct elements in the list l must have sum equal to zero.
    if sum(set) == 0:
        return True
    return False
```
The above function uses the built-in Python sum function to check if the sum of the three distinct elements in the list is equal to zero, and returns True if they do and False otherwise.
