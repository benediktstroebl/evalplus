```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
    ```

The function implements a simple algorithm:
1. The function first checks if the list contains exactly three distinct elements.
2. The function then sums up the three elements and checks if the sum is equal to zero.
3 If the list does not have three distinct elements, it returns False.
4 If the list has three distinct elements that sum to zero, it returns True.
