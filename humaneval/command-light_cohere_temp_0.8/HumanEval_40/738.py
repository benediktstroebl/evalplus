```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    return sum(x) in [-2, 0] for x in l

# Test the function with various inputs
if __name__ == "__main__":
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]) is True
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]) is True
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]) is False
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]) is True
    assert triples_sum_to_zero([1]) is False
```
The function 'triples_sum_to_zero' takes a list of integers as input and returns 'True' if there are three distinct elements in the list whose sum is less than or equal to zero, and 'False' otherwise. The test cases ensure that function's correctness by passing various inputs and checking the expected output.
