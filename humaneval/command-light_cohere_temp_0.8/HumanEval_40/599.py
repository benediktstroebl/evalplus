    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    function first checks whether list contains three distinct elements, and then it calculates the sum of those elements.

```
In this script, the `triples_sum_to_zero` function uses list comprehension and the `sum` function to check if the list contains three distinct elements whose sum is zero.  It checks if the required sum condition is met, and returns `True`.
