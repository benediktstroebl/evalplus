This Python code defines a function named triples_sum_to_zero that takes a list l representing a collection of integers as input. The function aims to determine whether there are three distinct elements in the list that their sum is equal to zero. 

It does so by first converting the input list into a set of unique elements using the set data type. Then, it checks whether there are at least three distinct elements in the set. If not, the function returns False. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of all elements in the list and checks if the total sum is equal to zero. 

This self-contained function can be used to solve the problem of checking whether there are three distinct elements in a list whose sum is zero.
