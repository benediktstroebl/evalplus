```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    return any(sum(x) == 0 for x in l) and all(x != 0 for x in l)

# Example usage:
test_suite = [
    [1, 3, 5, 0],
    [1, 3, -2, 1],
    [1, 2, 3, 7],
    [2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7],
    [1]
]
result = triples_sum_to_zero(test_suite)

print("Result:", result)
```
The script defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as input and returns `True` if there are three distinct elements in the list whose sum is equal to zero, and `False` otherwise. The `any` function returns `True` if at least one element in the list returns `True` in the function's internal call, and the `all` function returns `True` if all elements in the list are not equal to zero.

Finally, an example list of test cases is created, and the `triples_sum_to_zero` function is called with this list. The output will show whether the expected result is `True` or `False`.
