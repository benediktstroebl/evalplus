```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    return any(sum(x) == 0 for x in l) and sum(x for x in l) != 0
```
The provided code defines a function called `triples_sum_to_zero` that checks whether there are three distinct elements in a list that sum up to zero, and returns `True` if this condition is met, and `False` otherwise. The `any()` function checks for the existence of the condition in the list, and the `sum()` function checks if all elements in the list sum up to zero. The function returns `True` if all elements are not equal, which ensures that the sum is not zero. The code is a well-contained solution that efficiently determines whether the provided input list meets the desired condition.
