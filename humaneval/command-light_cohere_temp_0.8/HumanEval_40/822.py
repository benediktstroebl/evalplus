```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    """
    Function to check if there are three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero.
    Returns: True if the true, False otherwise.
    """
The function first checks if there are three distinct elements in the list that their sum is equal to zero. Then it returns True if this condition is met, and False otherwise.

```

In this solution, the function `triples_sum_to_zero` takes a list of integers as input and returns `True` if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise. The tests that simple conditions and can be easily passed and checked.
