```
The code defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` which takes a list of integers as an input. It then checks whether the Additionally particular list has at least three distinct elements whose sum is equal to zero. It returns `True` if this condition is met and `False` otherwise. The code also defines a helper function `test_passes` that takes a list as an input and returns `True` if there are three distinct elements in the list whose sum is equal to zero. Finally, the code passes the test cases and prints the results.
