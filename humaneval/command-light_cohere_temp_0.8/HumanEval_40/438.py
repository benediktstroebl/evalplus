Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of checking if there are three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero:
```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    n = len(l)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            total = l[i] + l[j]
            if total != 0 and total != l[-1]:
                return False  # Three distinct elements that sum to zero
    return True  # All combinations sum to zero
```
This solution is concise and self-contained, and it does not rely on external functions or modules. The function uses a optimal time complexity of `O(n) * 2^n` for the nested loop, which checks all possible pairs of elements in the list. This is another demonstration of Python's powerful and clear coding style.
