Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function to solve the problem:
```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    """
    Function that returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, 
    and False otherwise.
    """
    sum and list of integers = sum(map(int, l)))
    if sum == 0:
        return True
    return False
```
The above code has a function called triples_sum_to_zero that takes in a list of integers and returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and False otherwise.
