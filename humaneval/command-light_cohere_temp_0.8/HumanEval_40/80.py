```
The above code defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that checks if a list contains three distinct elements whose sum is less than or equal to zero. It achieves this by iterating over the list, summing up each element, and checking if the sum is less than or equal to zero. 

The function also handles the case where a list is empty, and it returns `False`. 

The code also passes the corresponding test cases with the given input.
