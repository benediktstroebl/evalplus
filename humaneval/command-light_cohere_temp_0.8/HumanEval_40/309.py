```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    if not found_zero:
        return True
    found_zero = False
    for num in l:
        if sum(set(l)) == 0:
            found_zero = True
            break
        else:
            pass
    return found_zero
```

This code uses a simple algorithm to find the sum of distinct elements in a list, and returns true if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and false otherwise. 

You can integrate this function into your markdown code block to solve the problem.
