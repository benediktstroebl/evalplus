The script defines a Python function called `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list l of integers as input and returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and False otherwise. The function uses the set() and a for loop to iterate through the list and adds each element to a set. It then uses theis unique element test to check if the sets have the same cardinality, which is the condition for the three distinct elements that sum to zero. 

This function solves the problem of finding three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero.
