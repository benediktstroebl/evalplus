```  This code defines a Python function named `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as input and determines whether the sum of three distinct elements in the list is equal to zero. The function utilizes two separate lists, `l1` and `l2`, to extract the first and last elements from the input list, respectively. The function then iterates through the list elements to calculate the sum of the three distinct elements and compares the result to zero. If the sum is equal to zero, the function returns `True`, indicating that there are three distinct elements in the list whose sum is zero. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating that the condition is not met.
