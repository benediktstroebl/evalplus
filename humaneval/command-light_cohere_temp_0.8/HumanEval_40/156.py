Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function to solve the problem of finding three numbers in a list that sum to zero:
```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
    False
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
    True
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
    False
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])
    True
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1])
    False
    """

    # Initialize sum and count of elements seen
    sum_so_far = 0
    count = 0

    # Iterate through the list
    for num in l:
        sum_so_far += num
        if sum_so_far == 0:
            return True
        count += 1

    return False
```
This script defines a Python function `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list `l` of integers as input and returns `True` if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise. The script uses a method of iterating through the list and checking if the sum of the three elements so far equals zero. If it does, it returns `True`, indicating that the condition is satisfied. If not, it returns `False`. 

This self-contained function efficiently solves the problem of finding three numbers in a list that sum to zero, which is a common task in computer science and data analysis.
