```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    """
    A function that returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and False otherwise.
    """
    list comprehension with three separate conditions to check if the sum is zero:
    return sum(x for x in l if x < 0) == 0 and sum(x for x in l if x > 0) == 0 and sum(x for x in l if x >= 0) == 0

```

This function uses the `sum()` function with list comprehensions to check if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero. It returns `True` if the three distinct elements that sum to zero are found, and `False` otherwise.
