```
This function is designed to check if a list of integers sums to zero and has exactly three distinct elements. It does this by first summing up all the elements in the list, and then checking if the sum is less than or equal to zero, and whether the list has exactly three unique elements. 

By using the approach, the function efficiently determines whether the input list meets the required conditions for a sum of zero and three distinct elements.
