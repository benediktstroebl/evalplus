This code defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as input and returns `True` if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise. The main part of the code defines a test function that creates an input list and calls the `triples_sum_to_zero` function with this list. Then, it prints the final result to the console.
