```python
from typing import List


def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    seen = set()
    return [num for num in numbers if num not in seen and num not in numbers[seen]]


# Test case
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]
result = remove_duplicates(numbers)
print(result)  # Expected output: [1, 3, 4]

# Test case 2
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4]
result = remove_duplicates(numbers)
print(result)  # Expected output: [1, 3, 4]
```
This Python script defines a function called `remove_duplicates` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with duplicate values removed. The function uses a set data structure to keep track of seen values, then it iterates through the input list and adds each value to the set if it's not already seen and is not a duplicate of any value already in the list.

The script then passes two test cases and prints the resulting list to verify the expected output.
