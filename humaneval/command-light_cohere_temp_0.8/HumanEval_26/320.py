```python
from typing import List
def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    seen = set()
    for num in numbers:
        if num not in seen:
            seen.add(num)
            result.append(num)
   return result
```
The provided Python code defines a function named remove_duplicates that takes a list of integers as input and aims to remove duplicate occurrences from the list, resulting in a unique list of integers. It accomplishes this by utilizing a set to keep track of seen numbers and iterating through the input list. The code efficiently removes duplicates by only adding unique elements to the result list while updating the set to ignore duplicates.
