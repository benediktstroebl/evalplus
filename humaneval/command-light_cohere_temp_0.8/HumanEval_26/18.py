# Example usage

result = remove_duplicates(numbers)
print(result) # Output: [1, 3, 4]

The provided code defines a function `remove_duplicates` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list where elements that occur more than once are removed. The function `filter_unique` is also defined to filter out duplicates from a list of integers and return a new list. The example usage demonstrates the example for both functions, passing a test case of a list of integers and printing the results.
