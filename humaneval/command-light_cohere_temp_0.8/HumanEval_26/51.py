    Keeping the duplicate elements left as they per the input.

```
This Python script defines a function called `remove_duplicates`, which takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with duplicate elements removed. The function utilizes the simple manipulation with sets and lists to achieve this effect. 

The script then provides several test cases to demonstrate the correctness of the `remove_duplicates` function.
