```
The `remove_duplicates` function accepts a list of integers and returns a new list with all the integers not present in the `seen` set. The function employs a set data structure to keep track of the elements it has seen, ensuring that each element is only added once. The function iterates through the regular list comprehension to filter out all duplicate elements.
