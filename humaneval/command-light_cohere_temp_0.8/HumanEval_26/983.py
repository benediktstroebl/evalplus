```python
from typing import List
def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]):
    return List(set(numbers))

# Test the function with an example input
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]
result = remove_duplicates(numbers)
print(result)

# Test with an empty list
result = remove_duplicates([])
print(result)

# Test with a list of strings
result = remove_duplicates([ ['item' i for i in range(10) ]])
print(result)
```
The provided code defines a function named `remove_duplicates`, which takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with duplicate integers removed. It utilizes the processor's `set()` to create a new list with unique elements and the original list. The code also provides three test cases: one with a list of integers, the second with a empty list, and the third with a list of strings. You can expand the can customize the problems and test cases for your functions in markdown code blocks.
