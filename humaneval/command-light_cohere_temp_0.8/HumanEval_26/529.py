The code provides a function called `remove_duplicates` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that contains only the unique elements. The function creates a set from the elements in the input list and then adds all the numbers that are not in the set, which are unique elements. This results in a removing duplicate values and returning a new list with unique elements.
