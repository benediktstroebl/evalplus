This script defines a function `remove_duplicates` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with duplicate elements removed. The function uses a list comprehension with `set()` and the `count()` function to identify and remove duplicates from the input list. 

The test cases demonstrate the expected behavior of the function, where it correctly removes duplicates and returns the list with elements that only occur once.
