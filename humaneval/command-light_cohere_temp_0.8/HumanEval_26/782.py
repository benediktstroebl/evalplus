```python

    """
    Remove all duplicate elements from the input list.
    Args:

    Returns:
        List[int] A list of unique integers.

``` 

This function, `remove_duplicates`, takes a list of integers and removes all duplicate elements from it. The function uses the `set()` to create a set of unique integers from the input list, then removes the duplicate elements from the set, and converts the set back into a list of integers. 

This self-contained function demonstrates the use of the `typing` module in Python, and can be easily imported into the environment of a larger script or application as needed.
