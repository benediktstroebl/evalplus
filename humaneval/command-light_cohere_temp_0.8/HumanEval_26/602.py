```python
from typing import List
def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]):
    """
    Remove elements that occur more than once from the input list.
    Args:
        List[int] numbers
    Returns:
        List[int]: list with all duplicates removed.

```
This Python script defines a function called `remove_duplicates` that removes duplicate elements from a list of integers. The function takes a input `numbers` (which is a list of integers), and returns a new list with duplicate elements removed. The function uses the unique function to create a new list with unique elements from the input list.
