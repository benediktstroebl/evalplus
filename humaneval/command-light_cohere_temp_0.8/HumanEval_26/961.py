Here is a self-contained Python function that removes duplicates from an input list of integers:
```python
def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    seen = set()
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num not in seen:
            seen.add(num)
            result.append(num)
   return []
    return result
```

The function 'remove_duplicates' takes a list of integers as input and uses a 'set' data structure to keep track of numbers that have been encountered before. It iterates over the ** each element in the input list, and if the element is not in the 'seen' set, it is added to both the 'seen' set and the 'result' list. 

This function is self-contained and efficiently removes duplicate elements from the input list, resulting in a list with unique integers.
