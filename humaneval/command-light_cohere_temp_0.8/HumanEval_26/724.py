This code implements a function remove_duplicates that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with duplicate elements removed. The function uses the to remove duplicates by converting the input list to a set, then using the built-in function count to check if any element appears more than once. Finally, the function uses list comprehension to filter out all elements from the set that are not in the original input list.
