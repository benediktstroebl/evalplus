This script defines a function `remove_duplicates` that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with all elements unique to the original list. The function uses the set to remove duplicates, which are then converted back to a list.

You can test the function using test cases, and it should pass all the tests.

This code is self-contained and can be copied and pasted directly into a markdown code block.
