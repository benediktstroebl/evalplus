Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem of removing duplicates from a list of integers and passes the tests:

```python
from typing import List


def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Remove elements that occur more than once from the input list.
    Args:
        numbers (List[int]) -> List[int]
    Returns:
        List[int]
    """
    return [x for x in set(numbers) if numbers.count(x) == 1]
```

The function `remove_duplicates` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that contains only the unique elements from the original list. It uses the set and the count of occurrences of each element in the input list to determine if it is a duplicate or not. 

This function is self-contained and solves the problem of removing duplicates from a list of integers.
