Here is a self-contained Python script that includes a function called `remove_duplicates`, which is used to solve the problem and pass the tests:
```python
from typing import List
def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ 
    Remove elements that occur more than once in a list.
    Args: 
        - A list of integers
    Returns:
        - A list of integers where each element is unique.
    """
    def remove_duplicates(numbers):
        # Initialize a Set to hold unique integers
        unique_ints = set(numbers)
        # Create a new list with elements from Set, removing duplicates
        return [int(x) for x in unique_ints]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example input and output
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]
    print(remove_duplicates(numbers))  # [1, 3, 4]
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1]
    print(remove_duplicates(numbers))  # [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
The function `remove_duplicates` takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers where each element is unique. The set is used to convert the input list into a set, which automatically removes duplicate elements, and then a list comprehension is used to convert the set back into a list of integers, without duplicates.
