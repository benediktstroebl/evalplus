```python
from typing import List


def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return [num for num in numbers if num not in numbers[numbers.count()]]


numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 1]
print(remove_duplicates(numbers))  # Expected Output: [1, 3, 4]
```

This script defines a function remove_duplicates that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with all elements from the input list that are not duplicates. The script then creates an list of integers, and calls the remove_duplicates function with this list. The expected output is a list with elements that are not duplicates, which are 1, 3, and 4. This showcases that the expected functionality of the function to work with the input data.
