Here is a self-contained Python function that removes duplicates from a list of integers and passes the tests:
```python
from typing import List
def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Initialize a set to store unique elements
    unique_elements = set(numbers)

    # Convert set back to list and return
    return list(unique_elements)
```

The function takes a list of integers as input and uses the `set()` function to store unique elements from the input list. Then, it converts the set back to a list and returns it.

This function can be used to remove duplicates from any list of integers. You can call this  `remove_duplicates(numbers)` and pass any list as an argument to the function to remove duplicates from the integers in the list.

Note: you can also use this function in your markdown code block by simply calling `remove_duplicates()` and passing the list of integers as an argument.
