```python
from typing import List


def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Initialize a set to store unique integers
    set_result = set()

    # Initialize an empty list to store the results
    result = []

    # Loop through the input list
    for num in numbers:
        # If the integer is already in the set, skip it
        if num in set_result:
            continue
        # Add the integer to the set
        set_result.append(num)

        # If the set is now updated with unique integers, add it to the result list
        result.append(num)

    return result
```
The code you provided is a Python function called remove_duplicates, which takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the unique integers from the original input. It uses the essential set data structure to keep track of unique integers and then loops through the input list, adding each integer to the set if it is not already present. After processing the the done, it adds the integers from the set to the result list, effectively removing duplicates. 

This code is self-contained and provides a solution to the problem of removing duplicates from a list of integers.
