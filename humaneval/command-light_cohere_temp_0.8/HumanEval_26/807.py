``` 
This script defines a function **remove_duplicates** that removes duplicates from a list of integers. It utilizes the set() and list(set()) methods to achieve this, which are considered Pythonic and efficient ways to handle this task. 

The test suite ensures that the function is correctly removing duplicates from the input list and returning the expected result.
