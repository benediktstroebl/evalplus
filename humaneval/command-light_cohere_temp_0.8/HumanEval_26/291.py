This script defines a function called `remove_duplicates` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with duplicate values removed. The function uses a set data to keep track of seen elements and then loops through the input list, checking each element against the set to see if it's not seen before. If the element is not in the set and not one of the duplicates, it's added to the output list.
