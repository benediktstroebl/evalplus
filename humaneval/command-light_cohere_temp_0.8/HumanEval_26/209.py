    return [n for n in numbers if numbers.count(n) == 1]

# Unit tests

numbers_set = set(remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
print(numbers_set)  # Expected output: {1, 2, 3, 4}

numbers_dict = {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4}

```
This code defines a function called remove_duplicates that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with duplicate elements removed. The function uses a unique element technique to achieve this. It creates a list of numbers and employs the count method to determine if each element is unique, returning it if so. The function then returns the list of integers, eliminating any that appear more than once in the input.

The code also has a set of unit tests to ensure that the function is working correctly. The output of the function call in the test case is then printed to verify that it is producing the expected output.
