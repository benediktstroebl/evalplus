```python

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    seen = set()
    result = [num for num in numbers if num not in seen and num not in [2] + seen]
    return result

# Test the function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]
result = remove_duplicates(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 3, 4]

numbers = [4, 2, 2, 1, 3]
result = remove_duplicates(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = remove_duplicates(numbers)
