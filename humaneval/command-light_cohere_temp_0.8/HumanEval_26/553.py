```
This Python script defines a function remove_duplicates that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with duplicate elements removed. The function uses the specified set comprehension to identify and remove duplicate elements from the input list. 

The script then tests the function with various input lists and verifies that the expected output is achieved. The output of the script matches the expected output of the problem statement provided earlier.
