#List of integers with duplicates
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]

#Test case 1: This list has duplicates, so the output should be [1, 3, 4]
print(remove_duplicates(numbers))  #This will print [1, 3, 4] due to the duplicates are removed

#Test case 2: This list doesn't have duplicates, so the output should be the same as the input
print(remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 4]))  #This will print [1, 2, 3, 4] due to there are no duplicates

#Test case 3: This list has a duplicate, so the output should be [1, 3]
print(remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 4]))  #This will print [1, 3] due to the duplicate is removed

print(remove_duplicates([ 'abc']))  #This will raise TypeError due to non-integer input
```

This code defines a function **`remove_duplicates`** that accepts a list of integers as an argument and creates a new list containing only the unique elements. This list is unique(numbers) contains only the elements that are present in the original list and not duplicated, which is the intended behavior of the function.
