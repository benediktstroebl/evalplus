```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Remove all duplicate integers from the list, keeping the first occurrence only.
    Args:
        numbers: list of integers
    Returns: list of integers without duplicates
    """
    result = [x for x in numbers if x not in numbers.
    return result

    return result
```

This Python function called `remove_duplicates` takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a new list with duplicate integer values removed, and containing only the first occurrence of each value in the input list.
