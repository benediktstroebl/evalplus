```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    seen = set()
    return [x for x in numbers if x not in seen and x not in numbers[numbers.keys()]]
 # Dictionary mapping elements to numbers they occur in. more just once in numbers. This set is new purpose:
```  This Python function, `remove_duplicates`, accepts a list of integers `numbers` as input. It creates a unique set of the elements in `numbers` using the `set()` method. Then, it iterates through each element in `numbers` and checks if the element is not in the seen set and not in the dictionary of `numbers`. If it meets these criteria, the element is added to the output list. 

This function demonstrates a self-contained solution and can efficiently remove duplicates from a list of integers.
