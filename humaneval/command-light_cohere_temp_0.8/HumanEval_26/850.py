# Example usage:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3]
unique_numbers = remove_duplicates(numbers)
print(unique_numbers)  # Output: [1, 3, 4]
``` 
This function remove_duplicates takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with duplicate elements removed, leaving only the unique elements. The output of this example will be [1, 3, 4], which are the unique integers from the input list.
