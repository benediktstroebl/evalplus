```

This Python script presents a self-contained function called `longest`, designed to extract the longest string from a list of strings. The function employs a typing and the Python sort module to ensure the input list is not empty and to order it based on length, which guarantees the longest string to be at the top. The `longest` function utilizes a sliding window approach to compare the current window with all the strings in the list. It calculates the maximum length and returns the string with the maximum length, or None if the list is empty. The function also implements the logic to handle cases where the list contains strings of varying lengths.

In the example provided, the `longest` function is invoked with a list of strings ["a", "b", "c"]. The function returns the longest string, which is "c", based on the criteria mentioned in the function. The output will be the longest string in the list.
