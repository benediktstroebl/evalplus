Here's the solution:
```python
from typing import List

def longest(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Return the longest string.
    """
    Return the String to find the longest
    return max(strings, default='')
```
This function takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest string. The function uses the max function from the typing module to find the maximum value in the list, which is the length of the longest string. This default value '0' is returned if the list is empty or has no strings.
