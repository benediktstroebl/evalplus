Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of finding the longest string in a list of strings:
```python
from typing import List

def longest(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Return the longest string.
    """
    first_index=0,
    current_length = 0
    max_length = 0
    for string in strings:
        if len(string) > current_length:
            current_length = len(string)
        max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
    return max_length if max_length is not None else ''

# Test cases
strings = ['a', 'b', 'c']
result = longest(strings)
print(result) # Output: c

strings = ['a', 'bb', 'ccc']
result = longest(strings)
print(result) # Output: c

strings = []
strings. strings longest('a', 'b', 'c')
print(longest(strings)) # Output: a

```

This Python function called `longest` takes a list of strings as input and returns the length of the longest string. This function compares the sort order of strings, so the longest string will be at the end of the list. The function works by initializing variables to keep track of the longest string found so far. The loop compares each string in the list to the current longest string found, and updates the variables accordingly. The final value returned by the function is the length of the longest string found.
