Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of finding the longest string in a list of strings:
```python
def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    if not strings:
        return None
    return max(strings, key=len)

# Test cases for the function
strings = ["a", "b", "c", "aa", "bb", "ccc"]
print(longest(strings))  # Output:  'ccc'

strings = ["a", "b", "bb", "aa"]
print(longest(strings))  # Output: 'aa'

strings = []
print(longest([]))  # Output: None

strings = ["a", "b", "bb", "ccc"]
print(longest(" "))  # Output: 'a'
```

This function takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest string in the list, or None if the list is empty. It uses the maximum function to find the maximum value in the list, and the `key=len` argument in the `max` function ensures that the longest string is returned.

It is an example of a self-contained function that has all the code needed to solve the problem within the function, without relying on external imports or modules.
