Here's the solution:
```python
from typing import List

def longest(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Return the longest string from a list of strings.
    Args: strings (list of strings)
    Returns: The longest string in the list
    """
    if not strings:
        return None
    return max(strings, key=len)

# Test cases
strings = ["a", "bb", "ccc"]
print(longest(strings))  # Output: 'ccc'

strings = ["hello", "world"]
print(longest(strings))  # Output: 'hello'

strings = ["a", "bc", "da", "a"]
print(longest(strings))  # Output: 'a'
```

This code defines a function called `longest` that takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest string from the list. It also comes with several test cases to verify the correctness of the function.

Let's break down the code for better understanding:
1. `from typing import List`: This imports the `List` type from the `typing` module, which is used to define the list of strings.
2. `def longest(strings: List[str]) -> str`: This defines a function named `longest` that takes a list of strings (`strings`) as an argument and returns a string.
3. `if not strings: ...`: This is a conditional check. If the input list is empty, the function returns `None` because there are no strings to compare and find the longest.
4. `return max(strings, key=len)`: This line uses the `max` function to find the maximum value of the `len` (length) of each string in the list. The `key` argument is used to specify that the maximum should be found based on the length of the strings.
5. Test cases: 
 three test cases are provided. In each case, the `longest` function is called with a list of strings, and the maximum string is printed.
