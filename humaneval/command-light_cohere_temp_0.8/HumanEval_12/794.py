Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem you provided:
```python
from typing import List

def longest(strings: List[str]) -> List[str]:
    """ Out of list of strings, return the longest one.

    if not strings:
        return None

    max_length = min(len(str) for str in strings)
    max_string = strings[max_length]

    return max_string
```

This script defines a function called "longest" that takes a list of strings as an argument. It then checks if the the strings list is empty, in which case it returns None. Otherwise, it finds the longest string in the list using the `min` function to find the minimum length of the strings and the `max` function to get the corresponding string. The "max_length" variable keeps track of the length of the longest string, and the "max_string" variable keeps track of the longest string.

Finally, it returns the longest string.
