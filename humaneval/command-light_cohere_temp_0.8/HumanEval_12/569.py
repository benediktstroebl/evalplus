```python
from typing import List, Optional

def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    """ Out of list of strings, return the longest one.

    if not strings:
        return None

    max_length = 0
    max_char = ''

    for string in strings:
        if len(string) > max_length:
            max_length = len(string)
            max_char = string[0]  # Assuming all characters are equal to the first character in a string

    return max_char

# Test case 1
strings = ['a', 'b', 'c']
result = longest(strings)
print("Result:", result)

# Test case 2
strings = ['a', 'bb', 'ccc']
result = longest(strings)
print("Result:", result)

# Test case 3
strings = []
result = longest(strings)
print("Result:", result)

# Test case 4
strings = ['abc'] * 10  # List of strings is empty
result = None
print("Result:", result)
``` 

The code defines a function named longest that takes a list of strings as input. It then checks if the the list is empty, in which case it returns None. For non- empty list, it also returns None. The code then proceeds to iterate over the list of strings and returns the first character of the longest string (assuming all characters are equal). 

Please note that this is a very basic implementation. It does not handle edge cases or lists that contain strings of different lengths, and it doesn't handle the case where a list of strings is empty. The actual behavior may vary depending on the Python version and implementation.
