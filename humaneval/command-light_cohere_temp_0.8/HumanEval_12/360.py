Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you described:
```python
from typing import List

def longest(strings: List[str]) -> List[str]:
    """ Returns the longest string in the list, or None if empty.
    Parameters: 
    strings (List[str]): A list of strings.
    Returns: 
    str: The longest string in the list.
    Returns:
    list of strings with the longest string.
    """
    list of strings = list(strings)
    return max(strings, key=len)
```

This function takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest string found in the list, or `None` if the list is empty.  The function uses the max function with the `key=len` argument to return the element with the maximum length.
