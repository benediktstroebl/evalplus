```python
from typing import List

def longest(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Out of list of strings, return the longest one.
    """
    If strings
    return str(max(strings, key=len)))
``` 
This code provides a solution to the problem you provided earlier. The function `longest` takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest string from the list. It uses the max function with the key parameter set to `len` to compare the lengths of each string and returns the maximum length as the result.
