```python
from typing import List

def longest(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Returns the length of the longest string.
    >>> longest(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    ```

This function takes a list of strings as input and returns the length of the longest string in the list. It uses the max function to find the maximum length and then returns the result. 

This is a self-contained function and solves the problem of finding the length of the longest string in a given list of strings.
