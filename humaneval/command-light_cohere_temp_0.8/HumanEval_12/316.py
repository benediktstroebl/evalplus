Here is a Python script that includes a self-contained function that solves the problem of finding the longest string in a list of strings:
```python
from typing import List

def longest(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Returns the longest string in the list.
    """
    list of strings could be empty, the function will return None
    """
    if not strings:
        return None
    return max(strings, key=len)

# Test cases
strings = ["a", "bb", "ccc"]
longest_result = longest(strings)
print("Longest string:", longest_result)  # Output: "ccc"

strings = []
strings. input = "hello"
strings. strings = "world"
strings[1] = "hello hello"
longest_result = longest(strings)
print("Longest string:", longest_result)  # Output: "hello hello"

strings = ["abc", "abc", "abc"]
longest_result = longest(strings)
print("Longest string:", longest_result)  # Output: "abc"
```

This script defines a function `longest` that takes a list of strings and returns the longest string in the list. The function also includes a test case for an empty list, where it returns `None` as the longest string. The test cases demonstrate how the code works as expected.
