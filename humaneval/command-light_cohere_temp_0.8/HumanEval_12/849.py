def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    """ Return the longest string from a list of strings """
    return max(strings, key=len)

# Test the function with different input
strings = ['a', 'b', 'c']
strings = ['a', 'bb', 'ccc']
strings = ['']
strings = ['a', 'bc', 'abc']

print(longest(strings))  # Output: 'ccc'

print(longest(['']))  # Output: None

print(longest(['a']*3))  # Output: 'a'
