Here's the solution:
```python
from typing import List
def longest(strings: List[str]):
    # Return the first string in strings that has the maximum length
    return next((x for x in strings if len(x) > len(str())), None)

# Example usage
strings = ['a', 'b', 'c']
longest(strings)  # Output: 'c'

strings = ['a', 'bb', 'ccc']
longest(strings)  # Output: 'ccc'

strings = []
strings. string string1, 'aa', 'abcde', 'apple', 'Banana')
longest(strings)  # Output: 'abcde'
```

This code demonstrates a Python function named `longest`, which aims to extract the longest string from a list. The function employs the next() with a generator expression to identify the first string within the list that has the maximum length. It returns `None` if the strings is empty or no strings have the same length.
