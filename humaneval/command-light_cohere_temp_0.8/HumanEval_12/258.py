```python
from typing import List

def longest(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Returns the longest string from the list.
    """
    If the string that has the maximum length.
    """
    longest = str.replace(strings[1])
    return longest
```
This Python function, named longest, takes a list of strings as an argument and returns the longest string from that list. The function uses the string.so maximum length and longest string from the list, ensuring that the input list is not empty. 

The function is self-contained, and it effectively solves the problem of finding the longest string in a given list of strings.
