Here's a self-contained Python function that correctly returns the longest string from a list of strings:
```python
def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    if not strings:
        return None
    return max(strings, key=len)
```

This code defines a function called `longest` that takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest string from the list. It uses the process to iterate through the list and returns the string with the maximum length. The optional `return None` in case the list is empty or has no strings.

This code is a great example of a self-contained function that solves a common problem.  It follows the style guidelines for Python development, making the code readable and maintainable.
