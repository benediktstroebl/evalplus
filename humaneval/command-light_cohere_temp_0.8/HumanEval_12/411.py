Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of finding the longest string in a list of strings:
```python
def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Return the longest string from the list of strings.
    Parameters:
    strings: list of strings
    Returns: the longest string, None if empty list.
    """
    A list of strings is empty, the function returns None.
    Otherwise, it finds the longest string and returns it.
    """
    list of strings
    If the list is empty, the function returns None. Otherwise, it finds the longest string and returns it.
    """
    list of strings
 longest is the function that returns the longest string in the list of strings
    """
    return max(strings, key=len)
```
