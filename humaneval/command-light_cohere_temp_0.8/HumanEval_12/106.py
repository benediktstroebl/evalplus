This script defines a function `longest` which takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest string in that list. The function utilizes the max function to get the maximum length of all strings and uses list comprehension to compare all strings and find the first one with the same length. This function also uses the time complexity of `O(n)` and is an efficient solution for this problem.
