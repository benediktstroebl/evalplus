Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you have provided:
```python
from typing import List
def longest(strings: List[str]):
    """
    Returns the longest string from the list of strings.
    """
    strings = [str for string in strings if string]
    return max(strings, key=len)

# Test the function
strings = ['a', 'bb', 'ccc']
print(longest(strings))  # Output: 'ccc'
```

The code defines a function called `longest` that takes a list of strings and returns the longest string from the list. The function works by iterating over the list of strings and storing them in a list called `strings` using a generator expression. The `max` function is then used to find the string with the longest length, and the key argument is set to `len` to make the comparison case-sensitive.
