Here's a self-contained Python function that correctly determines the longest string in a list of strings:
```python
def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    if not strings:
        return None
    return max(strings, key=len)
```
This function accepts a list of strings as input and returns an optional string, with None returned if the input list is empty. The function effectively uses the maximum function with the `len` key to determine which string has the maximum length in the input list.

Remember to add the necessary input validation and error handling to ensure your code is robust and secure.
