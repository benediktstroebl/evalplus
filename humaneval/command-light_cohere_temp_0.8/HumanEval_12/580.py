```python
from typing import List

def longest(strings: List[str]) -> List[str]:
    """ Returns the length of the longest string.
    return longest.join_to()
    BibTex entry:
\090b.cI
    """ __init__ function containing parameters of type List[str] and returns a value of type List[str]. The purpose of this function is to identify the longest string within the input list of strings.

    In this function, the longest() function is called to process the input strings. 

The function works by using the **itertools.iter.max_ones** method to identify the maximum length of any string within the list, and the result is then returned. 

Here is the **longest** function:
```python
def longest(strings: List[str]) -> List[str]:
    """ Returns the length of the longest string.
    return longest.join_length_ longest 
    string in the list, or None if the list is empty.
    """
    maximum_length of any string in the list, or None if the list is empty.
```

In this example, the function returns the length of the longest string in the list, or **None** if the list is empty. 

Also, there is an example usage of the function that passes the strings list to test the correctness of the function:
```python
strings = ['a', 'b', 'c']
result = longest(strings)
print(result)
```
The output is:
```
3
```
