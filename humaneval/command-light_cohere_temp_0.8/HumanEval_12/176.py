Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you described:
```python
def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    if not strings:
        return None
    max_length = max(len(s) for s in strings)
    return strings[0].center(max_length)
```

This function takes a list of strings and returns the longest string from that list, with the first letter of each subsequent line centered using the maximum length.
