```python
from typing import List, Optional
def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Return the longest string from a list of strings.
    Args:
        strings (List[str]): List of strings to compare length.
    Returns: longest string, or None if empty input list.
    """
    return
    longest(strings)
```
This code defines a function called `longest`, which takes a list of strings as an argument and returns the longest string in that list. It uses the type hint `List[str]` for the function argument, which allows you to pass a list of strings as an argument to the function.
