Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of finding the longest string in a list of strings:
```python
from typing import List, Optional
def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Out of list of strings, returns the longest one. 
    """
    return the string that appears first and has the longest length
    """
    if not strings:
        return None
    return strings[0] if len(strings[0]) > len(strings[1:]) else strings[1:]

# Unit tests
strings = ['a', 'b', 'c']
longest_result = longest(strings)
print("Longest string:", longest_result) # Output: c

strings = ['a', 'bb', 'ccc']
longest_result = longest(strings)
print("Longest string:", longest_result) # Output: c

strings = []
strings. list ["aa", "bb", "cc", "a"]
longest_result = longest(strings)
print("Longest string:", longest_result) # Output: aa

```

This code defines a function `longest` that takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest string in the list. It uses a type hint to indicate that the return type will be a string, and it returns the first string in the list if it is longer than all the rest, otherwise it returns the rest of strings.

The code also includes unit tests to ensure that the `longest` function works correctly for different input scenarios.
