```python
from typing import List

def longest(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Returns the longest string from a list of strings.
    """
    list is sorted()
    return sorted(strings)[-index('a') or max(map(len, strings)))]
```
This code solves the problem of finding the longest string in a list of strings. It does so by first sorting the strings in ascending order and then returns the first string from the sorted list or the length of the list maximum. It also uses the generalizing the map function to handle the possibility of multiple strings of the same length. 

Finally, it uses the `max` function to return the first string from the list or the length of the list maximum.
