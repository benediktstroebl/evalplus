```
The function 'longest' takes a list of strings and returns the length of the longest string in the list. It then initializes a variable 'max_len' to 0, and 'longest_str' to ''. It then iterates through the list of strings and compares the length of each string with the current maximum length. The longest string is then updated with the current string. 

The function then returns the longest string found. The test cases pass as expected, and the function is self-contained and correct.
