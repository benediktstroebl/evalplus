```python
def get_positive(lst):
    return [num for num in lst if num >= 0]

# Test the function
assert(get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6]) == [2, 5, 6])
assert(get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]) == [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123])
assert(get_positive([]) == [])
assert(get_positive([21, -1]) == [])

# Test for negative input
try:
    get_positive([-10, -11])
except AssertionError as e:
    print(f"Input list is not positive: {e}" )

```

This code defines a function `get_positive` that takes a list as input and returns a new list containing only the positive numbers from the original list. It is also includes a test suite that verifies the function's correctness against various inputs. 

The test suite includes several different scenarios to ensure that the function correctly filters out only positive numbers from the input.
