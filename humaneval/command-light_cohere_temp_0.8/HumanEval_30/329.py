```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    """Return only positive numbers in the list"""
    return [num for num in l if num >= 0]

# Test suite
def test_get_positive():
    assert get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6]) == [2, 5, 6]
    assert get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]) == [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]
```
This code defines a function `get_positive` that takes a list as an argument and returns a new list containing only the positive numbers from the original list. It uses list comprehension to filter out the numbers greater than or equal to zero, ensuring that only positive numbers are included in the output list.

The code also provides a test suite with two assertions to verify that the `get_positive` function returns the correct results for the given input lists.
