The code defines a function `get_positive` that takes a list as input and returns a new list containing only the positive numbers from the original list. The function utilizes a simple list comprehension to filter out the positive numbers. The test cases are defined as a list of lists, where each inner list contains a set of numbers and a boolean condition. The `test_positive` function is then tested against these test cases, checking if it returns the correct results for each case. The code provides a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of getting only positive numbers from a list, along with passing corresponding tests.
