```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    """Return only positive numbers in the list"""
    return [num for num in l if num > 0]

# Test the function with a sample list
print(get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6])) # [2, 5, 6]

# Test the function with another list with floating numbers
print(get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])) # [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123]
```
This script defines a function get_positive that takes a list l as input and returns a new list containing only the positive numbers from l. The function is self-contained and passes the tests with sample lists.
