```python
def get_positive(lst):
    return [x for x in lst if x >= 0]

# Test the function
test_get_positive = []
test_get_positive.py  #
[-1, 2, -4, 5, 6]
test_get_positive.py  # [-5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]
test_get_positive.py  = [get_positive(test_get_positive)
print(test_get_positive)
