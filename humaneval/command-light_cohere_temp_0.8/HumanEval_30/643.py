def get_positive(lst):
    return [x for x in lst if x >= 0]

# Test the function with a list containing various numbers
result = get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
print(result)  # Expected output: [2, 5, 6, 9, 123, 1]

# Test with a negative list
result2 = get_positive([-5, -20, -100, -23])
print(result2)  # Expected output: []
