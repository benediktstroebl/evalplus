```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    """Return only positive numbers in the list"""
    return [num for num in l if num >= 0]

# Test the function with different input
print(get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]))  # Expected Output: [2, 5, 6, 7, 8]
print(get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]))  # Expected Output: [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123]
```
The function get_positive takes a list l as input and returns a new list containing only the positive numbers from the input list. The function uses list comprehension to iterate through the input list and checks if each element is greater than or equal to zero using the condition num >= 0. The resulting list of positive numbers is then returned by the function.

The code also includes test cases for the function, passing different lists as input and printing the resulting lists to verify that the function is working as expected.
