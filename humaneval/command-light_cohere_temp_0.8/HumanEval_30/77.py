```python
def get_positive(lst):
    return [x for x in lst if x >= 0]

# Test cases
tests = {
    "positive numbers" => get_positive([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]),
    "negative numbers" => get_positive([-1, -2, -3, -4]),
    "empty list" => get_positive([]),
    "mixed list" => get_positive([1, 2, -3, 4, 56])
}

print(f"Test results:")
for test, success in tests.
``` 
This code defines a function `get_positive` that takes a list as input and returns a new list containing only the positive elements from the original list. The function uses a list comprehension and the condition `x >= 0` to filter out the positive elements. 

The code also provides several test cases for the function, and passes them through the `tests` dictionary. The function is then called with each test case, and the result is printed.
