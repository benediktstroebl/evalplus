```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return f" {0:0>{n}",
    """ 
    The code returns a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to n inclusive.
    For example, calling the function with n = 0 produces '0', and calling it with n = 5 produces '0 1 2 3 4 5'.
    
    def test_string_sequence():
        assert string_sequence(0) == '0'
        assert string_sequence(5) == '0 1 2 3 4 5'
        assert string_sequence(10) == '0 10 10 10 10'
        assert string_sequence(1) == '1'
        assert string_sequence(15) == '1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10'
        assert string_sequence(0.5) == '0.05'
        support: returns a formatted string containing space-separated numbers, each starting from 0 and increasing by 1 for each number. This can be used as a list comprehension, but the function provides a more concise way to generate the sequence.
