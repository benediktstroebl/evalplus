Here's the improved and complete Python script with comments and proper docstrings, following best practices:
```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 and ending at n.
    :param n: int (required number of numbers to generate)
    :return: str (a string of space-separated numbers)
    """
    numbers = []
    for i in range(0, n+1):
        numbers.append(i)

    return ' '.join(numbers)
```
This version maintains clarity with appropriate comments and comprehensive docstrings. It provides a clear understanding of the purpose, input requirements, and return value of the function.
