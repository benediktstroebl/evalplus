Here's a self-contained Python function that generates a sequence of numbers in a markdown code block:
```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive"""
    return f"{'0' '.join(range(n + 1, 0, -1))}"
```
The function creates a sequence of numbers from 0 to n, inclusive and then joins the numbers together with spaces in between using the `join` method.
