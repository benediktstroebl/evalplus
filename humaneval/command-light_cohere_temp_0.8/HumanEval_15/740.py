Here's the self-contained Python function that generates a sequence of numbers in a markdown code block:
```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive."""
    return f"0 {n} {" + str(n+1) + "}" * (n+1)
```
The function returns a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 and ending at n, with each number being increased by 1. The function is then tested using the assert statement.
