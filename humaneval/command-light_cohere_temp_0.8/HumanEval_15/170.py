Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of creating a sequence of numbers in markdown code blocks:
```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    >>> string_sequence(0)
    '0'
    >>> string_sequence(5)
    '0 1 2 3 4 5'
    """
    return f'{0:0b}' * n
```
The function uses the **format()** method to insert a formatted string with zeros at the beginning and then concatenate that string with the number n.
