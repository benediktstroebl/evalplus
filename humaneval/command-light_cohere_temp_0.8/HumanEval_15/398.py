Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of generating a sequence of numbers in markdown code:
```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive."""
    return f"0 {n}..."  # f-string to represent a number in markdown format

# Test cases
test_string_sequence = [
    challenge = 0
    assert string_sequence(challenge) == "0"
    challenge = 5
    assert string_sequence(challenge) == "0 1 2 3 4 5"
]
```
This function takes an integer n as input and returns a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.  The numbers are represented as strings in markdown format.
