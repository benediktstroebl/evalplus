Here's a self-contained Python function that generates a sequence of numbers in a markdown code block:
```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return f" {0}{1}{2}{3}{4}{5}" * (n+1)
```
This function takes an integer n and uses string formatting to create a sequence of numbers from 0 to n, inclusive. A test that this function can be incorporated within a markdown code block, which will be displayed as a single line with its backticks.
