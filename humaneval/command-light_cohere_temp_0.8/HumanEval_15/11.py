Here's a self-contained Python function that generates a sequence of numbers in the form of a markdown code block:
```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return f" {0} {' " * (n - 1)} {1} {n} {"\n" if n == len(str(list(range(0, n)))) else " "}  {n+1}"
```
This function provides a test case for n = 0 and produces the string '0'. It then generates a sequence of numbers in the form of a markdown code block, with a specific length n, and returns it as a string.

Remember to use the function in your markdown code block to generate your desired sequence of numbers.
