Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of generating a sequence of numbers in a markdown code block:
```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive"""
    return f"0 {n} {n+1} {n+2}..."

# Tests
def test_sequence():
    assert string_sequence(0) == '0'
    assert string_sequence(1) == '1'
    assert string_sequence(5) == '0 1 2 3 4 5'
    assert string_sequence(6) == '0 1 2 3 4 5'
```
