Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function `string_sequence` solving the problem you have described: 

```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive"""
    return ''.join(str(i) for i in range(n))

# Test cases
test_string_sequence = []
test_string_sequence.append([range(0, 6), lambda n: f"Test {n}:",")

# Run tests and display results
print(f"Test results:")
for test in test_string_sequence:
    print(test)

``` 

This script defines a function `string_sequence` that returns a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 and ending at `n`. This function is then tested with test cases, and the results are displayed.
