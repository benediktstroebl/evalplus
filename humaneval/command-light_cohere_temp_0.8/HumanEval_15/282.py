Here's a self-contained Python function that generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to n:
```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return f"0 {n}" * (n+1)
```

This function takes an integer n as input and uses the `f-string` technique along with the **string formatting** to create a string containing numbers from 0 up to n, separated by spaces.

This is just one way to solve this problem, and you can always innovate and find better ways to we need to solve it!
