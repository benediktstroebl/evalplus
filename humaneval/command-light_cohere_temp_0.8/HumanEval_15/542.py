Here is a Python script that solves the problem of generating a sequence of numbers in a markdown code block:
```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive"""
    return f"0 {n} {n+1} {n+2} {n+3} {n+4}"

# Test cases
test_sequence = [
    lambda: "0"
    assert string_sequence(0) == "0"
    assert string_sequence(1) == "1"
    assert string_sequence(5) == "0 1 2 3 4 5"
    assert string_sequence(6) == "0 1 2 3 4 5"
    assert string_sequence(10) == "0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1"
]

# main code
print(string_sequence(5))
```
