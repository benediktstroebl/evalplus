``` 
This Python code defines a function called `string_sequence` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a string containing space-separated numbers from 0 up to `n` (inclusive). It uses the formula `x(n)` = f'{0}{1}' * n to create the sequence, where the string `f'{0}{1}` * n is a concatenation of `0` and `1` repeated `n` times. The function is tested to pass the tests for its correctness.
