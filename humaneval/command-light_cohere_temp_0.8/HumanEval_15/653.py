Here's a self-contained Python function that generates a sequence of numbers in a markdown code block format:
```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """ Returns a string in the markdown code block format with space-delimited numbers starting from 0 to n.
    """
    string_sequence(0)""" + "\n"
    """0"
    """\n  # Corrected line to add newline after 0
    """
    for i in range(n + 1):
        yield f" {i}"
```
The function will generate a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 to the value of n, including the number 0.
