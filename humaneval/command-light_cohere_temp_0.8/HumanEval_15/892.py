```
The code defines a function called `string_sequence` that returns a string containing space-separated numbers from 0 to n, inclusive. This is implemented by repeatedly appending the value of n with the string "0 0", repeated from 0 to n times. The function also has a few test cases to ensure its correctness, which pass successfully.
