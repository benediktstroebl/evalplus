Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem of generating a sequence of numbers in a markdown code block:

```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive"""
    return " ".join([f'{i+1}' for i in range(n)])

#test cases
def test_sequence(test: str) -> None:
    assert test == " ".join([f'{i+1}' for i in range(5)])
    assert test == " 0 1 2 3 4 5"
    
test_sequence("function passed 5")
test_sequence("not a valid function")
```
Do you want help with anything else with code or any other topic?
