This Python code defines a function called string_sequence that takes an integer n as input and returns a string containing space-separated numbers from 0 up to n (inclusive). The function uses the range function to generate the sequence of numbers and joins them with a space using the join method. The code also provides several test cases to verify the correctness of the string_sequence function, passing different values for n and checking the output against the expected results.
