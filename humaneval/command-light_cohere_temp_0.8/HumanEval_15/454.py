Here's a self-contained Python function that generates a sequence of numbers:
```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive"""
    return f"0 {n} 0"*(n+1)
```
This code defines a function `string_sequence` that takes an integer `n` as an argument and returns a string containing the sequence of numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive). The code uses the format `0 n 0... 0` to create the sequence of numbers. The `n` argument is used to specify the upper limit of the sequence. The function uses the string formatting to create the sequence of numbers separated by spaces.
