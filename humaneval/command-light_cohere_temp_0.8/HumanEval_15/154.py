Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of generating a sequence of numbers in a markdown code block:
```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return f"{0}{' ' * (n - 1)}{n}"

# Test cases
test_sequence = [
    (0, "0"),
    (5, "0 5 10 15 20"),
    (10, "0 10 20 30"),
    (42, "0 42"})

for test in test_sequence:
    print(test)
``` 
This script defines a function `string_sequence` that generates a sequence of numbers in the format "0 X Y Z", where X is the next number and Y is the space character. The function uses string formatting to create the desired output. 

Note that this code is self-contained and does not require any additional modules or external functions.
