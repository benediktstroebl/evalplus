Here's a self-contained Python script with a function that generates a sequence of numbers in a markdown code block format:
```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive"""
    return f"0 {n} {n+1} {n+2} {n+3}..."

#Test case 0: Generate sequence for 0
print(string_sequence(0))
#Test case 1: Generate sequence for 5
print(string_sequence(5))
```
This code defines a function called `string_sequence` that takes an integer `n` as an argument and returns a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to `n`, inclusive. The `print` function is used to test the function with two test cases, printing the result.
