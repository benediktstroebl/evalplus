Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function string_sequence that creates and returns a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to n:
```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return ' '.join([str(i) for i in range(0, n+1)])

# Test the function
test_string_sequence = string_sequence(5)
print(test_string_sequence)
# Prints: 0 1 2 3 4 5
```
The function passes the unit tests, hence it is self-contained and solves the problem of creating a sequence of numbers up to n. The function can be used as is, for example, to generate the sequence for any given number n.
