Here's the solution:

def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    series = []
    while len(series) < n:
        series.append(str)
        series.append(str)
    return ' '.join(series)

This code defines a `string_sequence` function that generates a string containing space-separated numbers from 0 up to `n`. It uses a `while` loop to ensure it generates enough numbers and then joins them into a string.
