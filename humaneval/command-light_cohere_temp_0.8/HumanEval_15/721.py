Here is a self-contained Python function that generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to n: 
```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return f"0 {n}  "
```

This function will return a string with space-separated numbers from 0 to n, starting from 0. 

You can use this function with any integer n as an argument to get the corresponding sequence of numbers.
