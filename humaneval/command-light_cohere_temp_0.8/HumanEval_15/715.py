Here's a self-contained Python script that defines and demonstrates the function `string_sequence`:
```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return f" {0:0b} {' '.join(str(i)) for i in range(1, n+1)} {n} "
    ```

This function generates a string containing space-separated numbers from 0 to n, inclusive. generate the above in the string format. It utilizes a string formatting and a list comprehension to achieve this. 

This is a classic example of how to create a function with one expression and one statement. 

The test cases are included to demonstrate how the function can be used correctly.
