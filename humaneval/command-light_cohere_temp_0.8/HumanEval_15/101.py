Here's the Python code that defines a function that generates sequences of numbers in a markdown code block: 
```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive."""
    return f"0 {n}{" + "." * (n - 1)}
```
Do you need any further assistance with code or concepts related to Python?
