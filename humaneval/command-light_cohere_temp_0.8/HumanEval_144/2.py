```python
def simplify(x, n):
    try:
        numerator, denominator = map(float, x. plain() + n)
        if numerator * denominator == 0:
            return False
        simplified_x = (numerator / denominator)
        return simplified_x
    except ValueError:
        return "Invalid input: both numerator and denominator must be positive whole numbers"

#Test cases
test_cases = [
    ("1/5", "5"),
    ("1/6", "2"),
    ("7/10", "10"),
    ("0", "6"),
    ("9/5", "5"),
    ("10/0", "1"),
    ("7/3", "2/5"),
]

for case in test_cases:
    actual_result = simplify(*case)
    expected_result = eval(case[1]) if isinstance(case[1], str) else case[1]
    assert actual_result == expected_result, f"Expected: {expected_result}, Actual: {actual_result}"
```  This Python code defines a function `simplify` that takes two arguments, `x` and `n`, representing a fraction. The function attempts to simplify the expression `x * n` by converting the input strings to floats and performing basic arithmetic operations. It checks if the basic condition for fraction simplification is met: if the numerator and denominator are equal or zero, it returns `False`. The code also includes a set of test cases, each consisting of a fraction and its simplified representation. The `simplify` function is then called with each test case, and its result is compared to the expected simplified form. The actual and expected results are checked using assertions, and any discrepancies are reported as errors.
