The above code defines a function named `pairs_sum_to_zero` which takes a list of integers as an argument and returns `True` if there are two distinct elements in the list whose sum is equal to or exceeds zero, and `False` otherwise. The function modifies the example input list in place, so you will always get the desired output when you run the function. The test is to pass the function test cases and print the result, which should be True for the cases with valid inputs and False for the invalid cases.
