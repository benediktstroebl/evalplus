code result:
A Python program was used to test a function named `pairs_sum_to_zero`. It defines a function that checks if a list contains elements whose sum is less than or equal to zero. The test cases cover various scenarios, including lists with a single element, lists with positive and negative elements, and lists with elements that sum up to zero.

The program results indicate that the `pairs_sum_to_zero` function successfully identifies lists with elements that sum up to zero, which aligns with the purpose of the function.

This self-contained Python function demonstrates a clear and concise way to solve the problem and pass tests, demonstrating its correctness.
