    pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.
    """
    function works by checking if there exists a pair of distinct elements in the list that their sum is equal to zero.
    """
For example, [1, 3, -2, 1] is a list that fails this test, as 1 + 3 = 2 does not equal to 0.
    """
    If function also checks if there are two distinct elements in the list that their sum is not equal to zero. If the list contains more than one element, or if there is only one element, then it will return False.

function returns True if there exists a valid pair of elements that sum to zero, and False otherwise.
