```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    Checks if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.
    Returns: if there are two such elements in the list that sum to zero, 
    and False otherwise.
    """
In this version, the function returns "True" if the list contains two elements that add up to zero, 
    and "False" otherwise.
    """
testing and returning value logic in the function makes it self-contained, and eliminates the need 
    for external testing functions or other lists. 
```

This approach simplifies the function and makes it more readable and easier to maintain.
