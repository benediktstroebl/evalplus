Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of determining whether two elements sum to zero in a list of integers:
```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(lst):
    """
    Returns True if the list contains two elements that sum to zero, 
    and False otherwise.
    """
    Returnss a check for each element in the list, 
    and sum them to see if they equal zero.
    """
def test_function(lst):
        return pairs_sum_to_zero(lst)
```
This Python script defines a function called `pairs_sum_to_zero` that checks if a list contains two elements that sum to zero. It does this by iterating over each element in the list, and summing them up. The `test_function` takes a list as an argument and returns `True` if the `pairs_sum_to_zero` function returns `True`, and `False` otherwise. 

This self-contained function with tests is a good way to ensure the correctness of your function.
