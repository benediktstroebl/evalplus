```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    returns True if the sum of two distinct elements in the list can be zero, 
    and False otherwise.
    """
    list comprehension is very efficient way to achieve this.
    """
The two distinct elements are the first and last element.
    """
This function uses the above mentioned approach and returns True if there are two elements with opposite signs whose sum equals zero, and False otherwise.
