# Test cases
assert pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])

assert pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]) == False

assert pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]) == False

assert pairs_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]) == True

assert pairs_sum_to_zero([1]) == False
```
The Python code defines a function called pairs_sum_to_zero that checks whether a given list of integers has two elements whose sum is zero. The function returns True if it finds two such elements in the list, and False otherwise. This can be a example, find two elements whose sum is zero. It employs the shallow comparison to determine if the list has two distinct elements that sum to zero. The test cases demonstrate the expected behavior of the function. The code is self-contained, concise, and easy to understand, making it a good solution for the problem.
