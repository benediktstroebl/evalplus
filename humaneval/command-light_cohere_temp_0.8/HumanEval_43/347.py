```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(lst):
    return any(x + y <= 0 for x, y in zip(lst, lst[1:]))

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_list = [1, 3, 5, 0]
    result = pairs_sum_to_zero(test_list)
    assert result  # Testing the function's output with the expected result

    test_list = [1, 3, -2, 1]
    result = pairs_sum_to_zero(test_list)
    assert result  # Testing the function's output with the expected result

    test_list = [1, 2, 3, 7]
    result = pairs_sum_to_zero(test_list)
    assert result  # Testing the function's output with the expected result

    test_list = [2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]
    result = pairs_sum_to_zero(test_list)
    assert result  # Testing the function's output with the expected result

```
This code defines a Python function called pairs_sum_to_zero that takes a list of integers as input and returns True if the list has two elements whose sum is less than or equal to zero, and False otherwise. It achieves this by iterating through the elements of the list and their corresponding elements from the second half of the list, and checking if their sum is less than or equal to zero.
