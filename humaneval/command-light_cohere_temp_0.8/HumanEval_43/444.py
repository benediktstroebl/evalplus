```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    Checks whether the list of integers has two summable elements that sum to 
    zero.
    Returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, 
    and False otherwise.

# Test cases
    assert pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]) == False
    assert pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]) == False
    assert pairs_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]) == True
    assert pairs_sum_to_zero([1]) == False
```
The given Python function, `pairs_sum_to_zero`, takes a list of integers as input and returns `True` if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise. The function uses the dry logic to determine if there are two summable elements in the list.

Note that the function is simple and straightforward to use and understand, and it can be easily modified or extended to handle other types of problems or input lists.
