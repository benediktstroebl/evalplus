This solution uses a simple and straightforward approach to solve the problem. It defines a function test_pairsumtozero that takes a list of integers and returns True if the list contains two distinct elements that sum to zero, and False otherwise. The function is easy to solve by taking the first element and subtracting it from every other, keeping track of whether the sum is zero or not. The function then checks if the list passed to the pairs_sum_to_zero function returns True, which indicates that the list contains two distinct elements that sum to zero.

This function passes all the corresponding tests with the provided input data, as it should do.
