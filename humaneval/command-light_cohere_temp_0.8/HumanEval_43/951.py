    a list of integers is valid input for this function.
    First, let's use the 'sum()' function to calculate the sum of all elements in the list.
    If this list, we check if the calculated sum is equal to zero.
    If the list has two distinct elements that add up to zero, we return 'True'. We return 'False' otherwise.
