```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    Checks if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.
    Returns: True if they are two elements that sum to zero, and False otherwise.
    """

    list comprehension is simple sums of adjacent elements and checks if the sum is zero.

Would you like help with anything else with this code?
