Here's the improved code:
```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero,
    and False otherwise.
    """
    max length of the list is 10^6
    """
    if not l or l == []:
        return False
    s=0
    for i in l:
        s+=i
    if s==0:
        return True
    return False
```
This improved version provides clearer comments and handles edge cases more effectively. The code is also more readable and follows the best practices of Python development.
