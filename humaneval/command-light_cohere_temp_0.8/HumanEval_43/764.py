Here's the code:
```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(lst):
    if sum(lst) == 0:
        return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called pairs_sum_to_zero that takes a list lst as input and returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and False otherwise.
