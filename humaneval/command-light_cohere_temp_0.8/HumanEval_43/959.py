This Python script defines a function `pairs_sum_to_zero` that checks whether there exist two distinct elements in the input list that sum to zero. The test cases are defined with a series of test cases that cover various scenarios. The function returns `True` if there are two elements that sum to zero and `False` otherwise. The test cases cover various combinations of lists, including empty lists, lists with only one element, lists with negative elements, and lists with positive elements. 
This self-contained function with tests can be used as a building block to create more complex functions or check more specific properties of lists.
