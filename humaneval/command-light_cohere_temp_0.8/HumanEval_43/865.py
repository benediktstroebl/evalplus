The Python code defines a self-contained function `pairs_sum_to_zero` that solves the problem. It takes a tested cases and returns `True` if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise. The test cases are defined in the `test_cases` list, and the `pairs_sum_to_zero` function is called with this list. The function then returns the result. 

The code is concise and self-contained, effectively solving the problem and passing all test cases.
