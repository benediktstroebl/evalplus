This code defines a function called pairs_sum_to_zero that takes a list of integers as input and checks whether all elements in the list sum to zero. It then returns True if the such list contains two distinct elements that sum to zero, and False otherwise. The function is tested using a variety of lists and passes the corresponding tests. 

A few test cases are provided here with their corresponding expected outcomes. The code is self-contained, and it only requires the input list to solve the problem.
