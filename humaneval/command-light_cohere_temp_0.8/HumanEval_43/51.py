The function `pairs_sum_to_zero` takes a list of integers as input and returns `True` if there are two distinct elements in the list whose sum is zero. If there are no such singular elements in the list, it returns `False`.

The test function takes a list of integers as input and calls the `pairs_sum_to_zero` function to determine if the list contains two elements whose sum is zero. If the function returns `True`, the call the test function with a list that does not pass the test. 

Please note that this code is self-contained and does not require any external functions or variables to solve the problem and pass tests.
