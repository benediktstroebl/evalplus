    pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Return True if the list contains at least two numbers whose sum is less than zero.
    Return False otherwise.

    Check if the list has two distinct elements whose sum is less than zero.

# Example usage
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])) # Output: False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])) # Output: True
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])) # Output: False
```
The script defines a function `pairs_sum_to_zero` that checks whether two distinct elements in a list sum to a value less than zero. It uses the basic mathematical logic to achieve this, and tests are provided to demonstrate the expected behavior of the function.
