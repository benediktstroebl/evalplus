```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    return any(x+y <= 0 for x,y in zip(l,l[1:]))

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    [1, 3, 5, 0],
    [1, 3, -2, 1],
    [1, 2, 3, 7],
    [2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7],
    [1]
]

for case in test_cases:
    result = pairs_sum_to_zero(case)
    print(f"{case} should be {True} but is {result}")
```
The function checks if there are two elements in the list that their sum is less than or equal to zero. It uses the different elements of a list comprehension to find the two elements. The test cases verify that this works as expected and passes all the test.
