This code defines a function `pairs_sum_to_zero` that takes a list `l` as input and returns `True` if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero. It uses a Python list comprehension to achieve this.

The test cases are defined as a list of lists, each containing a list of integers. The `pairs_sum_to_zero` function is then called for each test case, and the results are printed to the console.
