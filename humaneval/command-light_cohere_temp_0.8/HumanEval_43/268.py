Here's the improved and self-contained solution:
```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    return sum(x > 0 for x in l) <= 2

# Example usage
test_cases = [
    [1, 3, 5, 0],
    [1, 3, -2, 1],
    [1, 2, 3, 7],
    [2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7],
]

for case in test_cases:
    result = pairs_sum_to_zero(case)
    assert result == case, f"Failed for {case}."
```

This solution focuses on using a generator expression to filter only positive elements, which sum up to a total less than or equal to 2. It's a optimized for better performance and self-containedness. The function can be tested with various test cases to ensure correctness.
