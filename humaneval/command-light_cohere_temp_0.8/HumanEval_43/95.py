The provided code defines a Python function named `pairs_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as its input. The function calculates the sum of the elements in the list and returns `True` if the calculated sum is zero, indicating that there are two distinct elements in the list that add up to zero. If the sum is not zero, or the list does not have two distinct elements, the function returns `False`. 

The function employs a basic mathematical concept where the requirement for two elements to sum to zero is met when their individual elements are added together, without the presence of any other values. 

The function uses list comprehension and basic mathematical operations to achieve this, and it is a straightforward implementation that can be easily understood and used.
