This Python script defines a function called `pairs_sum_to_zero`, which takes a list of integers as input and determines whether the list has two distinct elements whose sum is equal to zero. The function returns `True` if this condition is met, and `False` otherwise. The function is then tested with various input lists and passes the tests successfully. The script also defines a function `return_test`, which is used to check if the elements of the list satisfy the condition for having a sum equal to zero.
