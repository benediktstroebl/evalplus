```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    Returns True if all elements in the list sum to zero, False otherwise.
    """
    function implements the wait to find two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.
 pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]) 
 --> False 
Since there are no two elements that sum to zero (1 + 3 = 4, 5 + 0 = 5), the function will return False.

The function will return True since there are two distinct elements (2 and -5) that sum to zero. This passes the test.
