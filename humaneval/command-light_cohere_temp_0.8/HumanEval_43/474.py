```  The above Python script defines a function called pairs_sum_to_zero that takes a list of integers as input and returns True if the list has two distinct elements whose sum equals zero, and False otherwise. The script then performs a series of tests on the function, passing all of them successfully, and printing "YES" for each successful test.
