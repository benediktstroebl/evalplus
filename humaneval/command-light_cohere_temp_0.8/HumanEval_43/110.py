```python

    function uses the general method to find a solution, and the problem is 
    well-defined.

In this implementation, the pairs_sum_to_zero function first creates pairs of elements from the list and then sums them. It then checks if the sum of the elements in the pairs is equal to zero.

This implementation uses a general method that can be used to solve problems by creating pairs of elements from the list and then checking if their sum is equal to zero.

The test cases are also self-contained and pass the corresponding checks.
