The script defines a function called pairs_sum_to_zero that takes a list of integers as input and returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and False otherwise. The function uses the sum of all elements in the list is calculated using the built-in function sum, and it checks if the sum is zero by comparing it to zero.

The script then tests the function with a list of various integers and prints the result. The output of the function is True in this case because the list contains two numbers that add up to zero.

The script also tests the function with an empty list and the result is False, which is as expected.
