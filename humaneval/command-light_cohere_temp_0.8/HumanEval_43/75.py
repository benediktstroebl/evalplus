This function checks whether any two elements in the list sum to zero. If yes, it returns `True`, indicating that it's possible to achieve sum zero by adding these elements. If not, it returns `False`, indicating that no such pairs exist. 

This is a self-contained function that can be easily used in various markdown code blocks to check for the existence of pairs adding up to zero.
