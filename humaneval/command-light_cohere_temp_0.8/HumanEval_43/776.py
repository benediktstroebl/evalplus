The provided Python script defines a function called pairs_sum_to_zero that takes a list of integers as input and determines whether the list has two distinct elements whose sum equals zero. The function achieves this checking using two nested loops and returns True if the condition is met, indicating that the list contains two elements with opposite signs whose sum is zero. Otherwise, it returns False. The script also includes test cases for valid inputs and an invalid input, which fail the condition but pass the respective tests.
