Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of finding if two elements sum up to zero:
```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.
    """
    function:
    ```
    def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
        return sum(x for x in l if x != 0) == 0
```

This script defines a function `pairs_sum_to_zero` that takes a list `l` as an input. The function returns `True` if the list has two distinct elements that sum up to zero, and `False` otherwise. 

This function is self-contained and can be used to solve the problem of finding two elements in a list that sum up to zero. 

You can use this function to solve the problem and pass your own tests.
