```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    Returns True if the list has two distinct elements that sum to zero, 
    and False otherwise.
    """
    function checks for the two conditions: 
    - It checks if there are two distinct elements that add up to zero. 
    - It element is in the list.
    - It element is not equal to the second element.
    """
    check if the elements are not equal to each other, 
    the elements are distinct and add up to zero.
    """
function also checks if there are no other elements that add up 
    to the sum of the two elements.

```

In summary, the function pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as input and returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and False otherwise. This is a core method to solve the problem and pass the corresponding tests.
