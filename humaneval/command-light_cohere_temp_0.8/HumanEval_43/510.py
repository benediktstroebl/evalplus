    """
    A function to check whether all elements in a list sum to zero.

```

This function, `pairs_sum_to_zero`, takes a list `l` as an argument and checks whether all elements in the list sum to zero. It does this using a list comprehension, which goes through the list and checks each element's sum with its position. If the sum of any elements is zero, it returns `True`, indicating that there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and if the sum of any element is not zero, it returns `False`.
