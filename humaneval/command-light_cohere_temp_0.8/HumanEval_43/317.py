```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    Checks if all elements in the list sum to zero.

This script defines a simple and efficient way to check if all elements in a list sum to zero. It does this by creating a set of elements in the list and then using the `sum()` function to calculate the sum. The result is then a boolean value, indicating whether the sum is zero or not. The test case uses the relevant test cases and provides accurate results.
