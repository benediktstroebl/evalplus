Here's the improved version of the Python script that addresses the problem of determining whether two integers sum to zero:
```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(nums):
    total = sum(nums)
    return total == 0
```

In this approach, the function calculates the sum of the list of integers provided. The condition total == 0 ensures that the sum is indeed zero, which indicates that the two integers sum to zero.

This method is self-contained and straightforward, providing a clear and efficient solution to the problem.

Let's proceed to the next prompt.
