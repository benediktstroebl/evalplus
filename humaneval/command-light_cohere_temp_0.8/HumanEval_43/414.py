The code defines a function `pairs_sum_to_zero` which takes a list of integers as an argument. It then returns `True` if the list contains two distinct elements with opposite signs that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise. 

The example list that passes the test is `[2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]`. When the function is called with this list, it returns `True` since there are two elements with opposite signs that sum to zero. 

The code also provides an example list that does not pass the test `[1]`, and when the function is called with this list, it returns `False` since there is only one element in the list.
