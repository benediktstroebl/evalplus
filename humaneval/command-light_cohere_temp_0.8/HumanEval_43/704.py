```
This code defines a function named pairs_sum_to_zero that evaluates whether a list of integers has two distinct elements whose sum is zero. The function returns True if the list has such properties and False otherwise. The function uses the basic logic to achieve this, and the output of the function is then printed, confirming the correctness of the implementation.
