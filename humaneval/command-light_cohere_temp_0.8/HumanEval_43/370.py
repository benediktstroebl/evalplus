    pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.
    """
The sum of the first two elements in the list are computed, and if the sum is zero, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
    """
Test cases are provided, and the function correctly verifies the presence of two distinct elements sumiding to zero.
