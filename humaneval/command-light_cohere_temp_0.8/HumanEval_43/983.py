Here's the code with the self-contained function and the test suite:
```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.
    """
    list comprehension is the logic of the problem.

Sure, it seems like you're on the right track. I can assist you code generation or if you can provide a name and description for the function. The function and the test suite will help others understand and utilize the code effectively.
