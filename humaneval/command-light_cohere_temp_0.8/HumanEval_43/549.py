Here's the solution:
```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    Check if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.
    Return True if there are two elements that sum to zero and False otherwise.
    """
   
    two elements that sum to zero, the list is considered valid.
```

# Test cases
assert l2 = [1, 3, -2, 1] in pairs_sum_to_zero(l2)

# Successful test case
assert l3 = [2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7] in pairs_sum_to_zero(l3)

# Unsuccessful test case
assert l4 = [1, 2, 3, 7] in pairs_sum_to_zero(l4)

# Now test the function with empty list
assert l5 = [] in pairs_sum_to_zero(l5)
```
