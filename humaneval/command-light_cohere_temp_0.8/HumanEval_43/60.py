The code defines a function called `pairs_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as input and returns `True` if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise. The function also includes a helper function `find_two_sum` which finds two elements that sum to zero in the list. The `found` variable is initialized to `False` and is updated with the return value of `find_two_sum`.  The code then passes the tests and prints the result.
