The code defines a Python function called pairs_sum_to_zero that takes a list of integers as an argument. The function returns True if the list contains two distinct elements that sum to zero, and False otherwise. The function uses list comprehension and the sum function to check for this condition and returns the result accordingly.

The code then provides a series of test cases to check the functionality of the pairs_sum_to_zero function. The function is called for each test case, and the output is then compared to the expected result. The code will print "YES" if the function returns True, and "NO" if it returns False.
