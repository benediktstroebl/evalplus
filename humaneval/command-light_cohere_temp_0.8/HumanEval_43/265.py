Here's the improved Python script:
```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(nums):
    return (nums[0] + nums[1]) <= 0
```

This function requires a list of integers as input and quickly determines if the sum of the first and second elements is less than or equal to zero. If it's this, it returns `True` to indicate that the list has a sum-to-zero pair; otherwise, it returns `False`. This code is self-contained and does not require external functions or classes.
