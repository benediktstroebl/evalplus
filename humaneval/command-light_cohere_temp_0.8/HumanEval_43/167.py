```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    Returns True if all elements in the list sum to zero, False otherwise.
    """
    list of integers is passed as input.
    Each integer is one by one and checks if the sum of these elements is zero.
    If the list has an element that makes the sum non-zero, the function will return False.
    """

All numbers in the list must have a total sum of zero. This helps to check if there are any pairs that add up to a non-zero sum.

For example:
 lists_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]) == False
 lists_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]) == False
lists_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]) == True
lists_sum_to_zero([1]) == False
```
This function uses a simple algorithm to check if all the numbers in the list add up to zero. This algorithm is simple and efficient way to solve the problem.
