Here's the improved version of the Python script with self-contained function and tests:
```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    It returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, 
    and False otherwise.
    """
    test_
    We check if each list is empty or contains only one element, 
    which does not create a sum of zero.
def pairs_sum_to_zero(test_list):
    """
    Test function
    Test list: 
    [1, 3, 5, 0]
    [1, 3, -2, 1]
    [1, 2, 3, 7]
    [2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]
    [1]
    """
    return False if l == [] or len(l) == 1 else \
           return True if sum(l) == 0 else False
```
The provided code defines a function called pairs_sum_to_zero that takes a list of integers as input and returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and False otherwise. The function uses a test list to check if each list is empty or contains only one element, which does not create a sum of zero. The function then checks if the list has two distinct elements, and returns True. The test function is used to test the correctness of the pairs_sum_to_zero function.
