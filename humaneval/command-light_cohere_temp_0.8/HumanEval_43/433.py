```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    Returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, 
    False otherwise.
    """
    Python list comprehension is a simple and efficient way to check if there exist two elements with opposite signs that sum to zero.
    """
Therefore, for any list of integers, the function returns True if there exist two distinct elements that sum to zero, and False otherwise.
