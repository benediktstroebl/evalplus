    pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.
    """
    list comprehension is required to find the two distinct elements that sum up to zero in the list.
    """
The list comprehension will go through the list and check if each pair of elements sums up to zero.
    The two elements that exist, return True, and if not, return False.
    """
This function uses a list comprehension and a conditional statement to find the two elements that sum up to zero in the list. The function then returns True if the two elements are found, and False otherwise.
