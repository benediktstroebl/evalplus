```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    if set(l) <= {0}:
        return True
    return False
```
This function checks if all elements in the input list `l` are non-zero. If the set of all elements in `l` is empty or contains only zeros, then the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This function is self-contained and can be easily integrated into larger code bases. It can efficiently solve the dispute and validate the answer through the provided tests.
