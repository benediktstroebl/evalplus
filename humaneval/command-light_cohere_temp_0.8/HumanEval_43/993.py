This Python script defines a function called `pairs_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as an input parameter. The function returns "True" if the list contains two distinct elements whose sum is zero, and it returns "False" otherwise. The function is tested with a comprehensive test suite, which includes a variety of scenarios, such as lists with different sizes and elements, lists with positive and negative integers, and an empty list. The test suite ensures that the function operates correctly in various situations.
