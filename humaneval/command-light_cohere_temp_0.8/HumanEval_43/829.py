```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    Returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, 
    False otherwise.
    """
    Returns a expected list of integers, each integer is compared to the sum of the 
    preceding integers.
    """
list comprehension and built-in Python functions are used to solve this problem. 

The function works by checking each element against the sum of the previous elements. If a pair is found that adds up to zero, the function returns True, indicating the presence of two elements that sum to zero. If no such pair is found, the function returns False.
