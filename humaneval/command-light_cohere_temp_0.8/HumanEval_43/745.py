This code defines a function named `pairs_sum_to_zero` that takes a list `l` of integers as input. 

The function iterates over all pairs of elements in the list and checks if the sum of the pair is equal to zero. 

The function returns `True` if it finds two distinct elements that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise. The time complexity of this function is O(n^2) since it iterates over all pairs of elements in the list. 

This is a self-contained Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests.
