This Python script contains a self-contained function, `pairs_sum_to_zero`, which takes a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and vice versa. The function is designed with various test cases to ensure its correctness. The test cases include a sum of the two elements in the list being zero, not zero, and greater than five. The function passes all the test cases successfully.
