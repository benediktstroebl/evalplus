The provided code defines a function called pairs_sum_to_zero that takes a list of integers as an input parameter. The function returns 'True' if there are two distinct elements in the list whose sum is equal to zero, and 'False' otherwise. 

The code includes several test cases to verify the correctness of the pairs_sum_to_zero function. The test cases cover various scenarios, such as lists with different lengths, elements with opposite signs, and an empty list. The function performs as expected in all test cases, successfully identifying the lists with two distinct elements whose sum is zero. 

As a result, this code provides a self-contained solution and passing test cases for the problem of checking if there are two distinct elements in a list whose sum is equal to zero.
