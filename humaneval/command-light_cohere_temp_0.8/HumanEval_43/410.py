This Python code defines a function `pairs_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as input and determines whether there are two distinct elements in the list whose sum equals zero. It returns `True` if this condition is met, indicating that the list has at least two elements that add up to zero, and `False` otherwise. 

This function is then tested with various input lists to validate its behavior. The test suite includes a list of two elements, a list of three elements, an empty list, and a list with two distinct elements. The output is then a boolean indicating whether the list passes the test.

The provided test suite includes a diverse range of cases that cover various scenarios, helping to ensure the correctness of the `pairs_sum_to_zero` function.
