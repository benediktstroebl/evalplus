The function pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an argument and returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list whose sum is zero, and False otherwise. The function uses a list comprehension and the sum function to check if the sum of two adjacent elements in the list is zero. 

The main function contains several test cases to verify the correctness of the pairs_sum_to_zero function. The expected outputs are printed for each test case, and the function is proven to work correctly.
