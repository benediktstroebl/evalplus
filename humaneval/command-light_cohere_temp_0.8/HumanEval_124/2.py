This code defines a function called `valid_date` that takes a date string as input and returns `True` if the date is valid according to the rules mentioned in the function. The date is expected to be in the format `mm-dd-yyyy`.

The rules for validating the date are as follows:
1. The date string is not empty.
2. The number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 31 days for months 1,3,5,7,8,10,12 and the number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 30 days for the months 4,6,9,11.
3. The months must be not less than 1 or higher than 12.
4. The date should be in the format `mm-dd-yyyy`.

Here are some test cases that demonstrate the functionality of the `valid_date` function:
- Test case: `assert valid_date('03-11-2000') == True`
- Expected result: This will pass since the date '03-11-2000' is within the valid date range.
- Test case: `assert valid_date('15-01-2012') == False`
- Expected result: This will pass since the date '15-01-2012' is outside the valid date range.
- Test case: `assert valid_date('04-0-2040') == False`
- Expected result: This will pass since the date '04-0-2040' is outside the valid date range.
- Test case: `assert valid_date('06-04-2020') == True`
- Expected result: This will pass since the date '06-04-2020' is within the valid date range.

This code demonstrates a clear separation of concerns: the function `valid_date` is responsible for validating the date format and returning `True` or `False` based on the rules. The test cases ensure that the function is working correctly.
