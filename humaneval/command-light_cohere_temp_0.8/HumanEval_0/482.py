Here is a self-contained Python function that checks if any two elements in the list are closer than the given threshold:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    """
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[i] - numbers[i + 1] <= threshold:
            return True
    return False
```

This function returns True if any two elements in the list are closer than the given threshold, otherwise, False.

This function uses the range function to iterate over the list and checks if the difference between the two elements is less than or equal to the given threshold.
