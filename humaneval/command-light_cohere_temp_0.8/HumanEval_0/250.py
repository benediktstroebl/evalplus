Here's a self-contained Python script that defines a function called has_close_elements that checks if any two elements in the list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```

This function has_close_elements takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns True if any two elements in the list are closer than the given threshold, and False otherwise.

The function uses a for loop to iterate over the list of numbers, and a separate loop to iterate over the list again. If the difference between any two elements is less than the given threshold, the function returns True.
