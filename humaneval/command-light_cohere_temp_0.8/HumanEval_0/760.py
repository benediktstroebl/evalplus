Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # sort the numbers in descending order
    numbers.sort(key=lambda x: -x)
    
    # initialize a boolean that will be set to True if any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold
    has_close = False
    
    # check the first two elements in the sorted list
    if numbers[0] + numbers[1] < threshold:
        has_close = True
        
    # check the second and third elements in the sorted list
    if numbers[1] + numbers[2] < threshold:
        has_close = True
        
    # check the second and fourth elements in the sorted list
    if numbers[2] + numbers[3] < threshold:
        has_close = True
        
    # check the third and fourth elements in the sorted list
    if numbers[3] + numbers[4] < threshold:
        has_close = True
        
    return has_close

```

This code defines a function has_close_elements that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean value that indicates whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold.

The function first sorts the numbers in descending order using the sort() function and a lambda function as the sorting key.

Then, the function initializes a boolean variable has_close that will be set to True if any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold.

Finally, the function returns the value of has_close. 

This is a self-contained function that can be used to solve the problem and pass the corresponding tests.
