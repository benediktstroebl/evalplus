Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of checking if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Initialize two lists, one containing all elements in the list that are within the threshold, and the other containing all elements that are above the threshold
    close_list = [num for num in numbers if num >= threshold]
    far_away_list = [num for num in numbers if num > threshold]
    # Initialize two variables, close_count and far_away_count, to keep track of how many close and far elements there are
    close_count = 0
    far_away_count = 0
    # Loop through the list
    for num in numbers:
        # If the current number is in the close_list, increment the close_count
        if num in close_list:
            close_count += 1
        # If the current number is in the far_away_list, increment the far_away_count
        if num in far_away_list:
            far_away_count += 1
    # Return true if there are at least as close_count far away elements
    return close_count >= far_away_count

```
