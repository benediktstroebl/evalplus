Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of determining if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # check if there are two elements less than threshold apart
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] < threshold:
                return True
    return False

# Test
test_list = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
has_close_elements(test_list, 0.0) # False

This function works by iterating through the list of numbers and checking if there are two elements less than the given threshold apart. The function returns True if any two numbers are closer than the given threshold, and False otherwise.

Please note that this code uses the Python typing module, and it's a good practice to define type hints for function parameters and return values.
