Here's the solution for the problem you provided:

```python
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # sort numbers ascending and get the first one in the list
    numbers.sort(key=lambda x:x)
    first = numbers[0]
    # remove elements in the list that are greater than first element
    for x in numbers[1:]:
        if x > first:
            return False
    # check if any element in the list is less than the second one
    for x in numbers:
        if x < second:
            return False
    # all numbers in the list are different from the first two
    return True
```

This solution checks the first two elements of the list and returns True if they are not equal and any element in the list is less than the second element. It does not return True if the element in the list is equal to or greater than the second one.
