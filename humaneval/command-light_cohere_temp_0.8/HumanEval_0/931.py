Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.1)
   Wait for numbers that less than the threshold value
    """
    for num1, num2 in zip(numbers):
        if num1 <= threshold and num2 <= threshold:
            return True
    return False
```

The function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold. The code uses a list comprehension and a for loop to iterate over the list of numbers and checks if each pair of numbers is less than or equal to the threshold. The code uses the list comprehension to create the two numbers in the list and checks if they are less than or equal to the threshold value.
