Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort(key=lambda x:x)
    # Set as True that there are two elements with less than the threshold
    return len(numbers) >= 2 and numbers[0] < threshold and numbers[-1] < threshold
```
This function takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether there are any two numbers in the list that are closer to each other than the threshold.

The function first sorts the list of numbers. Then, the function checks if there are two elements with less than the threshold, and returns True.

Please note that this solution assumes that the input list is already sorted.
