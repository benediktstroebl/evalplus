Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you described:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # initialize distance matrix
    dist = [[float('inf')] * len(numbers)] for _ in numbers]

    # initialize an array to keep track of elements encountered so far
    seen = [False] * len(numbers)

    # initialize two variables for one and two numbers to compare
    min_dist = float('inf')
    min_num = None

    # iterate through the list of numbers
    for num in numbers:
        for i in range(len(dist)):
            # update the distance matrix
            dist[i][num] = dist[i][num] + dist[i][num - num]

        # update the minimum distance if a smaller one is found
        if dist[0][num] < min_dist:
            min_dist = dist[0][num]
            min_num = num

        # check if the number is encountered
        if seen[num]:
            continue

        # check if the current element is the minimum number
        if num == min_num:
            return True

    # initialize the seen array to True
    seen = [True] * len(numbers)

    return False

```
The function has_close_elements takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold. The function uses a array to store the minimum distance and checks if any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold. It uses the array to keep track of the elements encountered so far, and sets the seen array to True after the current number is processed. The function then iterates through the list of numbers and compares the current number with the minimum number to see if they are equal. If they are equal, the function returns True, indicating that a pair of numbers was found that are closer than the threshold.
