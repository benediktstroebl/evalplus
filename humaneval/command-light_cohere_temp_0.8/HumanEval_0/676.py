Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) is is True
    => False
    numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.8, 8.8, 9.0, 11.8]
    if numbers = numbers and the threshold is 0.5, the two numbers are 2.8, the given threshold.
    if numbers == threshold:
        return True
    elif numbers[0] < threshold and numbers[-1] > threshold:
        return True
    else:
        return False

This function takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold. 


This function uses the typing module, and also, uses new-style syntax to make the code more readable and easier to understand.

Note that this is just one possible solution to the problem.
