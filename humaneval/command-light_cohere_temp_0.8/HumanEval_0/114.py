Here's a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you've described: 

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    """
    return any of the two elements in the list are closer to each other than the given threshold, return True, otherwise return False.
    """

# Example usage
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]

threshold = 0.1

result = has_close_elements(numbers, threshold)
```
This code uses the `has_close_elements` function, which takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether any two elements in the list are closer than the threshold. The function uses the `sorted()` function to sort the list and then checks if any two elements are closer than the threshold, and returns a boolean value indicating whether they are.

This function can be used to check if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold, and can be used to solve the problem of determining if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold.
