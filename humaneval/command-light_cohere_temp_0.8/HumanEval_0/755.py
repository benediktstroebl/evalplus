Here's a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you provided:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
   .5) areTrue True
   5.
    return True

   
   
    """ Here is a complete script. It is a straightforward implementation of the function has_close_elements that uses the threshold parameter to determine if any two elements in the numbers list are closer than the threshold.
