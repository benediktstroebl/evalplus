Here's the solution to the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Check if all elements are numbers
    if not isinstance(numbers[0], float):
        return False

    # Initialize a set to store the number of elements that are equal to the given threshold
    set_threshold = set()
    for num in numbers:
        set_threshold.add(num)

    # Return True if any two elements in the list are closer than the threshold
    for pair in set_threshold:
        if pair[0] < pair[1] - threshold:
            return True

    return False
```
This code defines a function called `has_close_elements` that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two elements in the list are closer than the threshold. The function first checks if the is a list of numbers, then it returns False. Then, it initializes a set to store the number of elements that are equal to the given threshold. Finally, it returns True if any two elements in the list are closer than the threshold, which is achieved by checking each pair of elements in the set.

Note: You can use this function to check if any two elements in your list are closer than the given threshold.
