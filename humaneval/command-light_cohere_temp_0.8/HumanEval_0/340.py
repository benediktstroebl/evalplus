Here's the solution:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort(key=lambda x: x, -abs(x)**0.5), -1)
    # Define a set to check, if the two numbers are closer than the threshold
    return any(n1 <= n2 + threshold for numbers in numbers, n1, n2 in zip) for n1, n2 in numbers)
```

This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether the list has any pairs of numbers that are closer than the threshold. 

The function first sorts the list of numbers. Then, it uses the set of the numbers to check if the two numbers are closer than the threshold. 

The function then returns a boolean indicating whether any such pairs exist in the list of numbers.
