Test cases:
```python
# Test cases

# Print if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 0.0], 0.1)) == True

# Print if the list has any two numbers that are less than the given threshold
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)) == False
