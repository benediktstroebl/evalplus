Here is a self-contained Python function that checks if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Checks if any two elements in the given list are closer than the given threshold.
    Returns True if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold.
    has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.1)
    result in a in a list of numbers is given.  """

    threshold: float = 0.05) ->
    check if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. If so, return False; otherwise return True.  ```
