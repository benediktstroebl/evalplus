Here's the code that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list of numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort(key=lambda x: x, reverse=(threshold<x))
    # Initialize two variables
    min_distance = float("inf")
    max_distance = 0
    # Loop through the list of numbers
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        # Loop through the list again to find the minimum and maximum distance
        for j in range(len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                # Calculate the distance between the two numbers
                distance = numbers[i] - numbers[j]
                min_distance = min(min_distance, distance)
                max_distance = max(max_distance, distance)
        # Return true if the condition is met
        if max_distance < min_distance:
            return True
    return False
```

The function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold. The function sorts the sort the numbers and uses two variables, min_distance and max_distance, to keep track of the minimum and maximum distance between any two numbers. The function then loops through the numbers, and for each pair, calculates the distance between them. The function then checks if the max_distance is less than the min_distance. If the condition is met, the function returns true, indicating that there are close numbers in the list that are less than the threshold. 

The function then returns False, indicating that there are no close numbers in the list that are less than the threshold.
