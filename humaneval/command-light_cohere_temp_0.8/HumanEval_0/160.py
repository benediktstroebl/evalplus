Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you described: 

```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Use two pointers to traverse the list
    l1 = 0
    l2 = len(numbers) - 1
    current_distance = float("inf")
    while l1 <= l2:
        if numbers[l1] <= threshold and numbers[l2] <= threshold:
            current_distance = min(current_distance, math.ABC(numbers[l1], numbers[l2]))
        l1 += 1
        l2 -= 1
    return current_distance == float("inf")
```

This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold. 

The function uses the two pointers, l1 and l2, to traverse the list. The function checks if the numbers at positions l1 and l2 are both within the threshold. If so, it calculates the minimum of the two numbers using math.abs and sets the distance to this minimum. 
Finally, the function returns True if the distance is less than infinity, indicating that the two numbers are closer than the threshold, and False otherwise.
