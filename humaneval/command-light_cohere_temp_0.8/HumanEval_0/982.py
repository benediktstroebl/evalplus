Here is a Python script that includes a self-contained function `has_close_elements`, which checks if any two elements in the list are closer than the threshold.

Here's a sample of the implementation:
```python
from typing import List
import math

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    # Compare two first elements
    if numbers[0] - numbers[1] <= threshold:
        return True
    # Check if the list has more than 2 elements
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return False
    # Compare all other elements
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        if numbers[i] - numbers[0] <= threshold:
            return True
    return False
```

This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold. The function checks if the elements in the list are close enough, then it returns True, otherwise, it returns False.
