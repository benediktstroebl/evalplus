Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of checking for elements in a list that are closer than a given threshold:
```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[i] - numbers[i + 1] < threshold:
            return True
    return False
```
This function loops through the list of numbers and checks if the difference between consecutive elements is less than the given threshold. 
The function returns True if any two consecutive elements are closer than the threshold and False otherwise.
