Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.4)
   3.0 and 0.0) or Ramos are0.02)
   1"""

    """
# Run the function and print the result.
```
The `has_close_elements` function checks if in the list of numbers, there are any two numbers that are closer than the threshold value. The function returns True if any of the numbers in the list is less than the threshold, False otherwise.
