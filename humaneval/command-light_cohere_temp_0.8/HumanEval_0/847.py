Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function called has_close_elements, that checks and returns a boolean value indicating if any two numbers in the given list are closer than the given threshold:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    #first we sort the list
    numbers.sort()
   
    #check if the elements are sorted in ascending order we return True
    if numbers[0] <= numbers[1]:
        return True
    # check if any of the elements are less than the threshold
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        if numbers[i] < threshold:
            return True
    return False
```
This function takes a List[float] called numbers and a threshold float as input, and returns a boolean value indicating whether there are any two numbers in the list that are closer than the threshold.

The function first sorts the list of numbers. Then, it checks if the first elements are sorted in ascending order, we return True. If not, we check if any of the elements are less than the threshold. Then we return True.
