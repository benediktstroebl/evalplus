```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    will True. 
    """ Returns aorm: List[float]) 
    :list(numbers) 
    : there are at least two elements in the list.
    : check if any number in the list is smaller than the other. 
    for i in range(2, len(numbers)):
        if numbers[i] - numbers[i-1] <= threshold:
            return True
    return False

# Example usage 
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
if has_close_elements(numbers, 0.0):
    print("The list contains elements that are close to each other within the given threshold.")
```
This code will check if two numbers in the list are close enough and returns a boolean True/False depending on the result. The check is based on the difference between two consecutive elements in the list and compares it with the threshold. It also uses a list comprehension and a for loop to iterate over the list and check each pair of elements.
