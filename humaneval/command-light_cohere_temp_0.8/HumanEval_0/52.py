Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of checking if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    trifective conditions, a 2D lattice
    """
    # dict with keys close to each other threshold
    numbers_dict = {2.0: 0.1.0, 3.+1.0, 4}8.0, 4.0, 5.0}0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0}0, 0}
    +1
    # list of dictionaries
    for i in numbers_dict:
        if numbers[i] <= threshold:
            return True
    return False
```
