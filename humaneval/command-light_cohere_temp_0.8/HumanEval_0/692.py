```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.

```  The function checks if any two numbers in the list are closer than a given threshold. It works as follows:
1. For example, if you pass in [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 0.0, it will check that 1.0 and 2.0 are in the0.0 range, and 3.0 is smaller than in this range than 1.0, it will return False.
