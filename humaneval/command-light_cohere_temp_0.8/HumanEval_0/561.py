```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    """
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] < threshold:
                return True
    return False
``` 

This code defines a function that checks if any two consecutive elements in the input list are closer to each other than a given threshold. 

The function uses a loop to compare each pair of elements in the list. The function returns True if any element in the list is closer to any element in the remaining list, or if the list is empty. 

This function can be used to quickly check if any two elements in a list are close to each other within the range of the list, and it is a self-contained Python script that can be used to solve the problem.
