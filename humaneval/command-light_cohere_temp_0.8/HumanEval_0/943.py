Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function to solve the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x: math.max(x_abs(x), threshold))
    # Search for the first two elements that are closer than the given threshold
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        if numbers[i] < numbers[i-1] + threshold:
            return True
    return False
```
This function takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether there are any two numbers in the list that are closer than the threshold.
