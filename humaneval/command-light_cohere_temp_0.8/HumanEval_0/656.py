Here's a solution to the problem you provided:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold.
