Here is a Python script that solves the problem of checking if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) oruge
    never. It's the have any threshold.")
    return any(numbers[0] - numbers[1]) <= threshold
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two elements in the list are closer than the given threshold. 

This problem is solved efficiently with a straightforward approach that checks the difference between the two elements and compares it with the threshold.
