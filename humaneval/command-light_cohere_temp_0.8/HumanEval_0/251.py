Here's the solution to the problem you described:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Initialize a new list to store elements that are closer than the threshold
    closest_num = []

    # Loop through the input list
    for num in numbers:
        # Find the smallest number in the list so far
        min_num = min(num, threshold)

        # Check if the current number is less than the threshold
        if num < threshold:
            # If yes, add the current number to the list of elements that are closer than the threshold
            closest_num.append(num)

        # If the current number is equal to the threshold, it means that the numbers are already close enough
        if num == threshold:
            # If yes, skip the iteration
            continue

        # If the smallest number found so far is less than the threshold, the numbers are not close enough
        if min_num < threshold:
            return False

    # If the loop ends and no numbers were added to the list, the numbers are all close enough to the threshold
    return True
```

This script defines a function called `has_close_elements` that takes in two parameters: a list of numbers and a threshold. It then loops through through list, and for each number, finds the smallest number that is currently less than or equal to the threshold. This number is then be added to a new list that keeps track of elements that are closer than the threshold. If the smallest number found is less than the threshold, the function returns `False`, which means that no numbers are close enough. If the loop ends, and the list is empty, the function returns `True`, which means that all numbers are close enough to the threshold.
