```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # checks if any two consecutive elements in numbers list are closer than threshold.
    if any (n1, n2) = (n1 - n2) / 2  for n1, n2 in zip(numbers[1:], numbers[1:])
    return any(any(x < threshold for x in zip(numbers[1:], numbers[1:])) for _ in numbers)
```
This function uses a sliding window approach to determine if any two consecutive elements in the input list are closer than the given threshold. The function checks the the number pairs in the window, and returns True if any pair is closer than the threshold.
