Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort(key=lambda x: x)

    # Search the list elements which has two elements with smaller values than the threshold
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[j] < numbers[i] - threshold:
                return True

    return False
```

This function, `has_close_elements`, takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input. It returns True if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer than the threshold to each other. The code works by sorting the list of numbers and searching for pairs of adjacent numbers that are less than the threshold.
