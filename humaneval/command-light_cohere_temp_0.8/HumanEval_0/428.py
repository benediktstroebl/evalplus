```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.6)
   In under 0.1
   0 and 2.0) is 1.0 or 1.5.5
   0
    Evans function can only reduce the difference between two numbers using the Euclidean distance formula.
    > def euclidean_distance(x1: float, x2: float) -> float:
        """ Calculate the Euclidean distance between two given numbers."""
        return ((x1 - x2)**2 + (x1 ** 2) + (x2 ** 2)) ** .5 / 2

    return any(euclidean_distance(num1, num2) <= threshold)
``` 
This solution is a Python function that checks if any two elements in a given list are closer to each other than a given threshold. It uses the Euclidean distance formula and checks if the difference between two numbers is less than the threshold.
