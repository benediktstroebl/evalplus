Here's a self-contained Python function that checks if any two elements in the list are closer than a given threshold:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
   a
   a

    False
    """

The function uses a list of float numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean value that indicates if there are any two numbers closer than the given threshold in the list.
