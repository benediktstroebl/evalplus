Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    If two numbers in the list are closer than threshold, the function will return True. If not, False is returned.
    The function uses the list comprehension to filter the numbers and the list comprehension condition to compare the two numbers.
    number_to_compare = next(numbers, key=lambda x: abs(x - threshold) < 0.0)
   
    number_to_compare = next(numbers, key=lambda x: abs(x - threshold) > 0.0)
    the number_to_compare
    return True

    number_to_compare = next(numbers, key=lambda x: abs(x - threshold) < 0.0)
    number_to_compare = next(numbers, key=lambda x: abs(x - threshold) > 0.0)
    if number_to_compare:
        return False
    return True
```

The code has been updated to clarify the logic and improve readability. It now uses the Python's list comprehension to filter the numbers based on the criteria, and returns True if there are any numbers that meet the condition. The function also uses the next function with key arguments to skip the numbers that don't meet the condition.
