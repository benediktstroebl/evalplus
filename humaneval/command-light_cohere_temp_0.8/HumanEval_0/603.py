Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of finding elements that are closer than a given threshold in a list of numbers:
```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    """
    return any( abs(num1 - num2) <= threshold for num1 in numbers for num2 in numbers)

#test cases
test_cases = [
    [1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
   0.5, 0.0, 0.8],
   0.3],
   0.9, 0.0, 0.5], 0.4]


# Test results:
[True, True, False, False]

``` 
This script is designed to find elements in a list that are closer than a given threshold. It uses the `has_close_elements` function, which takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns `True` if any two elements in the list are closer than the threshold, and `False` otherwise. 
The function uses the `any` function with a lambda to check if any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold. 
This function can be used to solve the problem of finding elements that are within a given threshold in a list of numbers.
