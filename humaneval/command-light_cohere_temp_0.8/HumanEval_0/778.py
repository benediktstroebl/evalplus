Here's a self-contained Python function that checks if any two numbers in a given list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.0)!TIFFIO NOT WORK HERE"
```
This function returns True if any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold, otherwise, it returns False.
