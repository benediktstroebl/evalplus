```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.

    >>> numbers[0] = 1.0
    << 0
   0
    # No two numbers are equal, return True
    return True

test_data = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
threshold = 0.5
result = has_close_elements(test_data, threshold)

print(result)
``` 
The above code defines a function called has_close_elements that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input. It then checks if in the list of numbers, any two numbers are closer to each other than the given threshold. The function then returns True if any two numbers are equal, and False otherwise. The function is then tested against the test_data list and the result is printed to the console.
