Here is a self-contained Python function that checks whether any two elements in the list are closer than a given threshold:
```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold
    """
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This function will evaluate all pairs of elements in the list and return True if any two numbers are closer than the given threshold. 

You can use this function to solve the problem.
