Here is a self-contained Python function that checks if any two elements in the list are closer than the given threshold:

```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    """
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```

This function uses a nested loop to iterate through the list and checks if the difference between any two consecutive elements is smaller than the threshold. 
If this is the case, the function returns True, indicating that the elements are close to each other. 
If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns False, indicating that no elements are close enough. 

This is a simple and self-contained function that can be used to solve the problem of checking if any elements in the list are close to each other.
