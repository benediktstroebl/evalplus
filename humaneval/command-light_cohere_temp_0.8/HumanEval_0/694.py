```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.2)
   0.8, 4.5, 5.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.5, 6, 7,8)
    > has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 0.0, 6.0], 8, 9, 10)
    """
    """
    The function uses the Python built-in function `heapq` which returns the first value that is smaller than or equal to the value in `threshold`.

Here is the implementation of the function:
```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ 
    >>> numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 4.0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    >>> threshold = 0.2
    >>> return any_close_elements(numbers, threshold)
```

This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether there are any two numbers in the list that are closer to each other than the threshold. 

In this implementation, the function uses the heapq function to create a min heap from the list of numbers, and then iterates over the list of numbers, checking if any two values are less than or equal to the value in the threshold.

The function returns `True` if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer to each other than the threshold, and `False` otherwise.
