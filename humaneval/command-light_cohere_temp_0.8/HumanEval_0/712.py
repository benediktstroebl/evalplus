Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of checking if any two numbers in a given list are closer to each other than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort(key=lambda x:x)
    # check if the first element is greater than the second element
    if numbers[0] > numbers[1]:
        return True
    # check if the second element is greater than the first element
    elif numbers[1] > numbers[0]:
        return True
    # check if two numbers are closer than the threshold
    for i in range(1,len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i+1,len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```

This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the given threshold. The function uses a sorting function to sort the list of numbers and then checks for cases where the first element is greater than the second element, the second element is greater than the first element, and also checks if two numbers are closer than the threshold by iterating over the list of numbers.

Note that you can save this function as a module and import it when needed, and it can be used to solve the problem in a markdown code block.
