Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of finding pairs of elements in a list that are closer than a given threshold:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    Return True if any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold, otherwise False
    The function uses a heuristic approach to check if any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold. It works by sorting the numbers in ascending order and then iterating over the sorted list. It checks if the the numbers in pairs and checks if their difference is less than the threshold. It uses the he recursive approach and keeps track of the pair with the smallest number. If any of the pair's difference is greater than the threshold, it returns False, indicating that no close pairs are found. If no such pairs are found with a difference greater than the threshold, it returns True, indicating that all the numbers in the list are at a distance greater than the threshold.
