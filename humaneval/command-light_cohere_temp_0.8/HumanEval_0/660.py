Here's the solution:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This function checks if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the given threshold. It uses two nested loops and the == operator to check if the difference between the two numbers is less than or equal to the threshold. The function returns True if any of these conditions are true, indicating that the list has at least one pair of numbers that are close to each other.
