Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of checking if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    """
    possible cases:
    - The two numbers are equal and within the threshold.
    - The two numbers are not equal but closer than the threshold
    - The two numbers are closer than the threshold, but less than the threshold
    - The two numbers are equal and greater than the threshold.
    return:
    # Check if the first two elements are within the threshold
    if numbers[0] <= threshold and numbers[1] <= threshold:
        return True
    # Check if the two elements are greater than the threshold
    elif numbers[0] <= threshold and numbers[1] > threshold:
        return True
    # Check if the two elements are equal and less than the threshold
    elif numbers[0] == numbers[1] and numbers[0] < threshold:
        return True
    # return False
    else:
        return False
    return False
```

This code defines a function `has_close_elements` that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns `True` if any two elements in the list are within the given threshold, or `False` otherwise.  It's first, it checks if the first two elements are within the threshold by comparing their values and returns `True` if both are within the threshold. If the elements check fails, it then checks if the two elements are greater than the threshold and returns `True` if both are greater than the threshold. If the elements check fails, it then checks if the two elements are equal and less than the threshold by comparing their values and returns `True` if equal and less than the threshold. If none of these checks pass, it returns `False`.
