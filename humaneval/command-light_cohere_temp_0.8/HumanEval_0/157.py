Here's the solution to the problem:

```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
   +-ve""" list of numbers on the list, with two consecutive elements">threshold`.

    False
    """
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort()

   
    in ascending order

    # The two elements with the largest index are the elements with the largest values
    first, second = numbers[0] + numbers[1]
    if first, second > threshold:
        # Two consecutive elements are greater than threshold
        return False

    # Check the remaining elements
    for i in range(2, len(numbers)):
        # Check if the element at the current index is greater than threshold
        if numbers[i] > threshold:
            return False

    return True

The above-described function returns True if there are any two numbers on the list that are closer than the threshold.
