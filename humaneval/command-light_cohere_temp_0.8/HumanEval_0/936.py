```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    """
    return any of the following conditions:
        numbers[0] <= numbers[1] and numbers[1] <= numbers[0] with threshold >= 0.0
        numbers[0] + numbers[1] < threshold
        """

The code above defines a function `has_close_elements` that checks if two elements in a list are closer to each other than a given threshold. The function returns `True` if any of the conditions are met, and `False` otherwise.
