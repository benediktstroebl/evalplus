Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you provided:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort list of numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort_algorithm(numbers)
    # Set of two numbers which are close to each other than the given threshold
    close_set = set(n1 + n2 for n1, n2 in numbers if abs(n1 - n2) <= threshold)
    # Using Counter function to check the membership of set with numbers list
    has_close = Counter(numbers).has_close_elements(close_set)
    # Return the value of has_close variable
    return has_close
```

The function takes two parameters: `numbers` (a list of float numbers) and `threshold` (a float number).

The function sorts the list of numbers in ascending order using the `sort_algorithm()` function. Then, it creates a set of all the pairs of two numbers in the list that are close to each other (i.e., within the added by each other than the given threshold. Then, the function uses the Counter function to count the number of occurrences of each element in the set. 

Lastly, it returns the value of the `has_close` variable, which is equal to `True` if there are any two numbers in the list that are close to each other within the given threshold.
