Here's a self-contained Python function that checks if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    #sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort(key=lambda x: math.floord(x(x))  )
    #define a list to store the index of the two numbers that are closer to each other than the given threshold
    closer_idx = []

    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] + numbers[j] <= threshold:
                closer_idx.append(j)

    #check if there are two numbers that are closer to each other than the given threshold
    if closer_idx:
            return True
    return False
```

This function will first sort the input list of numbers. It then creates a list that stores the index of the two numbers that are closer to each other than the given threshold. Finally, it returns True if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer to each other than the given threshold.
