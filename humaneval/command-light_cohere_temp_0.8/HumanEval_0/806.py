```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Check if any two consecutive elements are closer than the threshold
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False

# Test the function
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 5.0, 2.0]
print("Any consecutive numbers are not closer than each other within the list.")

# Test the function with correct parameters
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 5.0]
print("Tested if two consecutive elements are closer than the threshold.")

# Test the function with empty list
numbers = []
print(has_close_elements(numbers, 0.0))
```

This code implements a function that checks whether two consecutive elements in a list are closer than a given threshold. The function iterates over the list and checks if the difference between two consecutive elements is less than or equal to the threshold. It returns True if any such of these conditions is met.
