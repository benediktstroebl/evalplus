Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem:

```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
   0.01), Also a0. No others.
    """ return False
or True
    """

This function takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as parameters. It then checks if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer to each other than the threshold. The function returns True if the list has at least two elements that are less than the threshold, and False otherwise.
