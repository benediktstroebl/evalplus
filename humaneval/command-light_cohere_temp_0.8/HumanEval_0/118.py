Here is a Python function that checks if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold:
```python
import typing
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    return any(abs(num1 - num2) <= threshold for num1, num2 in numbers)
```
This function uses the absolute value of the difference between two elements to check if they are within the given threshold. 
To test the function, pass your desired list of numbers and the threshold you want to compare against.
