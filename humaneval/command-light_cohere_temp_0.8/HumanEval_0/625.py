```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) False)
   3)! casel, when the number of elements is less than 2, then it is not possible to find two numbers closer to each other than threshold. So, the function returns True.
    Otherwise, if all numbers in the list are greater than the threshold, then the function returns False.
    return: 
    """ True"""

If you want, you can uncomment the function and use it to pass your test and check the result. You can use this microcosm, code or other features in the code.
