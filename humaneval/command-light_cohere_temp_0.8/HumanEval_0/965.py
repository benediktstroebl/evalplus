Here's the self-contained Python function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Initialize two lists, first and second.
    first = numbers[0]
    second = numbers[1:]
    return first[0] <= second + threshold and second <= first[-1] + threshold
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean value indicating whether there are any two numbers in the list that are closer to each other than the threshold. 

The function uses the "two-lists" technique to compare the first and second elements of the list of numbers, and returns the result of the comparison.
