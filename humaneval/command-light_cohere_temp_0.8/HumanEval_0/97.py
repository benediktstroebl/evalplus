Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you described:
```python
import math

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Calculate the difference between the two adjacent numbers
    def diff(number):
        return math.abs(number[0] - number[1])

    # Initialize a counter for the number of adjacent pairs
    count = 0

    # Iterate through the list of numbers
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i, len(numbers)):
            # Calculate the difference between the two adjacent numbers
            number1 = numbers[i]
            number2 = numbers[j]

            # If the difference is less than the threshold
            if diff(number1) < threshold and diff(number2) < threshold:
                count += 1

                # If the counter is now greater than the threshold
                if count > threshold:
                    return True

    return False

# Example usage
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]

numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
has_close_elements(numbers, 0.0)
```

This script defines a function **`has_close_elements`** that checks whether a list of numbers contains any two numbers that are closer than each other than a given threshold. The function iterates through the list of numbers, and for each pair of adjacent numbers, it calculates the difference between the two numbers. If the difference is less than the threshold, the function increments a counter for the number of adjacent pairs. If the counter is greater than the threshold, the function returns True, indicating that the list of numbers contains two numbers that are closer than each other than the threshold.
