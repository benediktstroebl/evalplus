```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    If there are two numbers with a difference less than or equal to the given threshold, return True.
    else, return False
    """ 
Let's take the test cases from the question: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0], [ and code threshold = 0.5.

And the test will be a list of numbers and a threshold value.

The function checks if there are two numbers in the list with a difference less than the threshold. If it finds any such pair, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

In this version, the function uses the `List comprehension` to filter the list of numbers and check if there are two elements with a difference less than or equal to the threshold.

The `has_close_elements` function is self-contained, and it does not require any additional arguments. The output will be returned as the True or False value.
