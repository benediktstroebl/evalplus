Here's a self-contained Python function that checks if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    """
    list comprehension
    First, we check all the elements of the list against the second element. 
    We check if any element is closer to the second element than the threshold.

    return:
        numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 4, 5.0, 0.0, 2, 0.0, 0.8]
        open, False
    return False
    """
    } 

   If there is any number in the list that is closer to the second element than the threshold, then the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False. 
This function uses the Python list comprehension to iterate through the list of numbers.
