Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function has_close_elements that solves the problem:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    """
    first_close = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
    other first_ close = [0.5, 0.5, 0.0]
    new number of numbers in numbers list such

    if any(first_close not in numbers) for 5) or  any(first_close in numbers) for 2 and numbers[i] <= threshold for i in numbers):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This script has a function that checks if any two numbers in a given list are closer to each other than a given threshold. The function compares the list of numbers to a set of numbers [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] that are in the closes. If the condition is not met, the function returns True, otherwise, it returns False.

The function uses the List comprehension with the not in the set of elements to filter out the numbers that do not satisfy the condition. The function then checks if any of the remaining numbers in the list are less than the threshold. The function finally returns False.

Note that this solution assumes that the input list is sorted in ascending order.
