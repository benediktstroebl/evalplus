Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function to solve the problem of checking if any two numbers in a list are closer to each other than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers = sorted(numbers)

    # Check each pair of numbers in the list
    for i in range(0, len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            # If the two numbers are closer than the threshold
            if numbers[i] + numbers[j] < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```

This code implements a function called `has_close_elements` that checks if any two numbers in the list are closer than a given threshold. The function sorts the first, the list of numbers, then, it loops through the list of numbers, checking each pair of numbers to see if they are closer than the given threshold. The function returns `True` if any of the conditions are met, and `False` otherwise.
