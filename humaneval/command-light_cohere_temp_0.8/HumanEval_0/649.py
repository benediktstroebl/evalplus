Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you've described:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False

# Test the function with markdown code block
# ...
# returns True, because the values are close enough
```
This function uses a for loop to iterate over the list of numbers, and checks if any two consecutive elements are closer to each other than the given threshold. This will return True, indicating that the list has at least one pair of elements that are close enough to each other.

You can use this function with a markdown code block to check if it solves the problem correctly.
