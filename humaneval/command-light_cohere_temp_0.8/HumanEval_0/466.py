Here's the solution:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```

This function checks if any two consecutive elements in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function iterates over the the list of numbers, starting from the second element, and compares each element with the next one to see if they are closer than the threshold. The function returns True after the have found any two elements meeting this condition.
