Here's a self-contained Python function that checks if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    :return False if any two numbers are farther than threshold, otherwise True
    :param numbers: input list of float, must not be empty
    :param threshold: float, must not be 0, if threshold is 0, function returns False
    :return: has close elements
    """
    # sort list
    numbers.sort()
    same 
    # checking
    first two elements
    first, second = numbers[0], numbers[1]
    if abs(first - second) <= threshold:
        return True
    # checking
    for num in range(2, len(numbers)):
        current, next = numbers[num - 1], numbers[num]
        if abs(current - next) <= threshold:
            return True
    return False
```
This function uses the sorting function to sort the list of numbers, then checks the first two elements to verify if they are closer than the given threshold. It then uses the straight forward for loop to iterate over the remaining elements of the list and checks the two elements against the given threshold.
