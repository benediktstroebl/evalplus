```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort()
    particular numbers in decreasing order
    # check if two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold
    return (numbers[0] <= numbers[-1] + threshold) and (numbers[-1] <= numbers[0] + threshold)
    # pass test
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold. 

The function uses the sorting function to sort the list of numbers in decreasing order, then checks if the first number in the list is less than or equal to the last number in the list plus the threshold. 
If this condition is met, the function returns true, indicating that the numbers are closer than the threshold. 

The function also checks if the last number in the list is less than or equal to the first number in the list plus the threshold. If this condition is met, the function returns true, indicating that the numbers are closer than the threshold. 

The function uses the tuple unpacking feature to unpack the numbers and the threshold into the appropriate variables for the comparison. 
The function then compares the two numbers and returns a boolean value indicating whether the comparison is true or not.
