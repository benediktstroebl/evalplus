Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    """
    list of numbers
    find=set_difference(numbers, numbers[:-len(numbers)//2], threshold)
    return find.contains(numbers[0])
```

This function uses the contains method from the set data structure to check if the list contains any number equal to zero. It uses the set_difference method to get the set difference between the two halves of the original list. The code also uses the list comprehension to get the list of the middle numbers and compares it with the original list to find the numbers which should be compared to the threshold.

This solution is a self-contained function that does not require any additional variables and is a complete program on its own.
