Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of checking if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold.

```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    Returns True if any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold.
    """
    def get_distance(a: float, b: float) -> float:
        """ Calculate the distance between two numbers."""
        return (a - b)**2
    return any(get_distance(n1, n2) <= threshold for n1, n2 in numbers)
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns True if any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold. It uses the mathematical function (**) to calculate the distance between any two numbers. The function uses the return value to check if the distance between any two numbers is less than or equal to the threshold.
