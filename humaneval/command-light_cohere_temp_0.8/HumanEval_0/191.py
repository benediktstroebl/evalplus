```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
``` 
This function takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold. 

The algorithm uses a nested loop to iterate over the list of numbers, and for each pair of numbers, it checks if the difference between them is less than or equal to the threshold.

This function can be used to quickly determine if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold, which is useful for a variety of problems in computer science and data analysis.
