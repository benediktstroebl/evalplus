```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort()
   
    in ascending order
    # set the lowest and the highest numbers to the beginning of the list
    numbers = [min(numbers), max(numbers)] + numbers[1:]
    # set the difference between numbers and the threshold
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        if numbers[i] - threshold < 0:
            return False
    return True
``` 
This function uses list comprehension and the min and max functions to check the first two elements of the list.
