```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # First, sort the input list
    numbers.sort(key=lambda x:x)

    # Check if the first element is less than the threshold
    if numbers[0] < threshold:
        return False

    # Initialize two pointers, i and j, to the first and last element of the sorted list
    i, j = 1, len(numbers)-1

    # Loop until the first and last elements are equal or the list is empty
    while i < j:
        # Compare the current elements
        if numbers[i] < threshold:
            return False

        # Move the pointers forward
        i += 1
        j -= 1

    return True
```
This code defines a function called has_close_elements that checks if any two elements in a list of numbers are closer than a given threshold. It does this by first sorting the list, then, comparing each pair of elements until it finds a mismatch, in which case it returns False. If no mismatch is found, it returns True, indicating that the list satisfies the condition.
