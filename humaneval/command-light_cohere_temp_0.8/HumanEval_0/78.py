Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) is4
   f
    style=late
        """
    If two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold, return True. If not, return False.

This script solves the problem of checking if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold.  It uses the testing to determine if any two elements in the list are closer than the threshold.
