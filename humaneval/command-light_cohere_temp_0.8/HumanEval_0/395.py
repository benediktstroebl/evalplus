Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of checking for elements that are closer than a given threshold in a list of numbers:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
   
False
    """ Check if any elements in the list are closer than the threshold, return True
    """
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This code defines a function `has_close_elements` that takes two arguments - a list of numbers and a threshold. It then iterates through pairs of elements in the list and checks if the difference between the elements is less than or equal to the given threshold. The script returns True if any of the elements are closer to each other than the threshold, otherwise, it returns False.
