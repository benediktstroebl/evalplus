```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This Python function checks if any two consecutive elements in the list are closer than a given threshold. It iterates over the result of a list comprehension, which iterates over all possible pairs of elements in the list. The function then checks if the difference between the current element and the next element is less than the given threshold.
