Here's a solution to the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in the list of numbers, are any two elements closer to each other than the given threshold.
    """
    list of numbers and a float threshold, it checks each element in the list against the other elements and returns True if any two numbers are closer than the threshold.
    """
    list of numbers and a float threshold, it checks each element in the list against the other elements and returns True if any two numbers are closer than the threshold.
    }

# Example usage
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0, 6.0]
threshold = 0.1

result = has_close_elements(numbers, 0.1)
```
This Python function, `has_close_elements`, checks if any two elements in a list of numbers are closer than a given threshold. It does this by comparing each element against every other element in the list. If it finds any pair of numbers that are closer than the given threshold, it returns True.
