Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    regions in a
    test above."""
    return any(x == y for x, y in numbers if abs(x - y) <= threshold)
```

This script defines a function `has_close_elements` that checks if any two numbers in the list are closer than a given threshold.  It uses the standard Python assert statement to check if any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold.
