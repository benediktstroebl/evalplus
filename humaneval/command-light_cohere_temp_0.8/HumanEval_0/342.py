Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that checks if any two numbers in a given list are closer than a given threshold:
```python
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers = sorted(numbers)
    # Initialize two variables to keep track of elements to check for closer proximity
    a = 0
    b = 0
    # Iterate over list of numbers
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        # If two numbers are the same, they are closer than the given threshold
        if numbers[i] == numbers[a] + threshold:
            b += 1
        a = i
    # If two numbers are not the same, they are not closer than the given threshold
    if numbers[i] != numbers[a]:
        return False
    return True
```
This function has_close_elements takes a List[float] called numbers and a float threshold as input and returns a bool value that indicates if any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold. 
The function first sorts the list of numbers. Then, it iterates over the list of numbers, and checks if the current number and the previous number are equal, and are closer than the given threshold. If they are equal and closer than the threshold, it increments the b variable. Finally, if the two numbers are not equal, it increments the a variable and checks again until it finds a pair of numbers that are equal and closer than the given threshold.
