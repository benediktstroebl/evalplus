Here is a Python script that defines a function to check for elements in a list that are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) False
   Thea
reals, we can use the distance formula from Euclidean geometry to calculate the distance between two numbers, and if the distance is less than the threshold, we can return True.
    return: 
    distance = ((numbers[0] - numbers[1]) ** 2 + (numbers[0] - numbers[1]) ** 2) ** 0.5 / 2.25
    guaranteed by theif a distance calculation that is used.
 to compare the distance with the threshold, and return True if so.
    return distance > threshold
