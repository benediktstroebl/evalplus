Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of checking if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers)-1):
        for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```

This function takes two parameters: `numbers`, which is the list of numbers to check, and `threshold`, which is the minimum threshold for two numbers to be considered close.

The function uses a loop to iterate through the list of numbers, and for each pair of numbers, it checks if the difference between them is less than or equal to the given threshold. If the condition is met, the function returns `True`, indicating that the numbers are close enough. 

If the loop completes without finding a satisfying condition, the function returns `False`, indicating that no numbers in the list are close enough. 

This function is self-contained and can be used to solve the problem of finding close pairs of numbers in a given list with a given threshold.
