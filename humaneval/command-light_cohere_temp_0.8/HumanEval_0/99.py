Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you have provided:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    # Keep track of the first and second last elements that are equal to the threshold
    first_equal = [num for num in numbers if num == numbers[-1]]
    second_equal = [num for num in numbers if num == numbers[0]]
    # return True if the first equal element is not less than the second equal element plus the threshold
    return first_equal[-1] > threshold + second_equal[0]
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the list contains any two numbers that are closer to each other than the threshold. The function uses the sorting the list to make it easier to search for the first and second equal elements. Then, it returns True if the first equal element is not less than the second equal element plus the threshold.
