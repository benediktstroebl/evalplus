Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you provided:
```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Corner case
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return False

    # Check if the two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)-1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False


# Test
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 5.0]
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
has_close_elements(numbers, 0.0)
print(has_close_elements(numbers, 0.0))
```
This script defines a function called `has_close_elements` that checks if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold. The function uses a `type` module to create a function that checks if the difference between two elements is less than or equal to a given threshold. The script then passes this test by calling the function with a list of numbers and a threshold.
