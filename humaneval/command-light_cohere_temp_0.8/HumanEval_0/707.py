Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Ensure all elements are compared
    numbers = sorted(numbers)
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[j] - numbers[i] < threshold: return False
    return True
```
This function checks if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold. It achieves this by sorting the list first and then comparing each element with every other. It returns True if any pair of numbers violates the condition.

The function uses the typing module for type hints, which is a useful feature in Python that helps with better code readability and can be used to enforce type hints.
