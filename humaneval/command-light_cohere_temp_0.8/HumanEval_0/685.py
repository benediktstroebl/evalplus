Here's the self-contained Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    :return True if any two distinct elements in the list are closer to each other than the given threshold, else False"""
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] + numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns True if any two distinct elements in the list are closer to each other than the given threshold. The function uses two loops that iterate over the list, and check if the sum of the two elements at the current index is less than or equal to the given threshold. 

Note that the function has been self-contained, meaning that it does not require any external function or variable to be called or assigned, and it has all the necessary information and logic to solve the problem. 

Please note that this is a simplified version of the function and it does not contain any redundant or unnecessary parts.
