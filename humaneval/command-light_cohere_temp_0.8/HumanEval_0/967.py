Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you provided:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Initialize a set to store all elements in numbers list
    elements_set = set(numbers)
    
    # Initialize a counter for checking pairs of elements in the list
    count = 0
    
    # Loop through all pairs of elements in the list
    for element1 in elements_set:
        for element2 in elements_set:
            # Check if the distance between two elements is smaller than the threshold
            if abs(element1 - element2) < threshold:
                count += 1
    
    # If the count of pairs with close elements is greater than zero
    return count > 0
    
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `has_close_elements` that takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input. It initializes a oldest set of all elements in the numbers list and a counter for checking the pairs of elements. Then, it loops through all pairs of elements in the list, and checks if the absolute difference between the two elements is smaller than the threshold. Finally, it returns a value of the function, which is `True` if the count of pairs with close elements is greater than zero and `False` otherwise.
