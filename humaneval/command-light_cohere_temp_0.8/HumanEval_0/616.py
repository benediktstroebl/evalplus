Here is a Python script that defines a function called has_close_elements, that checks if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List
import math

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x: math.abs(x-x))

    # Then, we start by checking if the list is empty
    if not numbers:
        return False

    # We check if the first and second element are less than the given threshold
    if numbers[0] + numbers[1] < threshold:
        return False

    # We go through the list and check each pair of numbers
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            # We check if the two elements are closer than the given threshold
            if numbers[i] + numbers[j] < threshold:
                return True

    return False

# Test the function with a sample input
sample_input = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
has_close_elements(sample_input, 0.0)
```
This script defines a function that takes in a list of numbers and a threshold. It first sorts the sort the list of numbers. Then, it checks if the first and second elements are less than the given threshold. If the first and second elements are less than the given threshold, it returns False. It then checks each pair of numbers in the list by iterating over the list. Finally, it returns True if any two elements are closer than the given threshold.
