```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.

    return any value: True, in this function, the list of numbers is passed as an argument and the threshold is passed as another argument. The function checks if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer to each other than the threshold. The function returns True, if there are any two numbers that are closer to each other than the threshold, and False, if there are no such numbers.

The function works by using the Python built-in function 'distance' to calculate the distance between two numbers in the list. The function then uses the Python's built-in function 'if' to check if the distance between the two numbers is less than the threshold.
