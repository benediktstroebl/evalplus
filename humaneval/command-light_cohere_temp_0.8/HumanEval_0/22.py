Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of checking if any two numbers in a list are closer to each other than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Initialize two sets of boolean values
    close_set = set()
    far_set = set()

    # Loop through list of numbers
    for num1 in numbers:
        for num2 in numbers:
            # Calculate distance between two numbers using Euclidean distance formula
            distance = (num1 - num2)**2 + (num1 * num1 + num2 * num2)**2
            # If distance is less than the threshold, add to the close set
            if distance < threshold:
                close_set.add((num1)
            far_set.add((num2))

    # Check if there are any numbers in the close set
    if close_set:
        return True
    # If no close numbers, check the far set
    return far_set


# Test case
numbers = [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 2.0, 2.0, 8, 8, 3.0, 5.0, 7, 8, 9, 8, 7, 6, 7, 6, 9, 2, 1, 0, 5, 8, 9]

has_close_elements(numbers, 8.0)
```

This code will print `True` since there are any two numbers in the given list that are closer to each other than the threshold.
