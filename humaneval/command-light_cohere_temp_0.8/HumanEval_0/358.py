Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # sort the list of numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x: x)
    # check if two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):
            if math.abs(numbers[j]-math.abs(numbers[i]) <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```

This function takes two arguments: a List[float] called numbers, which contains the numbers to be checked, and a float called threshold, which is the minimum distance between two numbers that will be considered close enough. The function sorts the array in ascending order using the numbers[j] index and the less-than-threshold comparison. The function then loops through the maximum number in the list, and checks if the difference between the current number and the next number is less than the threshold. The function returns True after the two numbers are found to be close enough.

This function uses the typing module, which allows for better code readability and error detection. It also uses the way to sort the list of numbers in ascending order, which makes the code more efficient.
