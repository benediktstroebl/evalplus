Here's a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you've described:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
   0
   1.5.

    return:True
    value
    return True
   ```

This script defines a function called `has_close_elements` that checks if any two numbers in the list are closer than a given threshold. The function returns `True` if any two elements in the list are closer than the threshold, otherwise, it returns `False`.
