Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This code defines a function that checks if any two consecutive elements in the list are closer than the given threshold. The function iterates through two loops, comparing each element in the first half of the list with the next element, and returns True if any two elements are closer than the given threshold.
