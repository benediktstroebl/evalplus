```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    Return True if any two numbers are closer than threshold, otherwise False
    numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.5]
   6.0, 0.0, 3]
   5.
    if any two of the6 or greater than threshold, they are closer than threshold.
    return True
   
    else, return False
```
This function evaluates if any two elements in the list are closer than a given threshold. It returns True if any of the two elements are closer to each other than the threshold, and False otherwise.
