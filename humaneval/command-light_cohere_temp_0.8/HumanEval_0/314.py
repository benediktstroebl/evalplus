Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you have provided:
```python
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort()
   
    then
    # Check for every pair of numbers, if their difference is less than the threshold
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This function, has_close_elements, takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than each other than the threshold. The function uses a sort function to sort the list of numbers, then, it checks for every pair of numbers, if their difference is less than the threshold. If the difference is less than the threshold, the function returns True, else it returns False.
