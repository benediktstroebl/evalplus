Here's the answer to the prompt:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.8)
   .5).
    6,5
   
    True

```
This function takes in two parameters: a List of numbers and a threshold. The function then checks if in the given list of numbers, are any two numbers that are closer to each other than the given threshold. The function returns True if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer to each other than the threshold, and returns False otherwise.
