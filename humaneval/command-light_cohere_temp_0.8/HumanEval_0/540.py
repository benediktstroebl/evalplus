Here's a solution to the provided problem:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    Return True if any two numbers in the list are within threshold apart.
    """
    critical and difference between numbers. If numbers are too close and the difference is less than threshold, it is considered a false
    """
    return any(x <= y for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
```

The above code snippet takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input. It returns a critical and difference between numbers. If any two the specific conditions are met, it returns True, indicating that the list contains elements that are close to each other or that the difference between the elements is greater than the threshold. 

It uses the `zip()` method to iterate over the elements of the list and compare each pair of numbers.
