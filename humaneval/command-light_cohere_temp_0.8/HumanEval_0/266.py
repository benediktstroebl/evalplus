Here is a self-contained Python script that provides a solution for the problem:

```python
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Define a lambda function to calculate the distance between two numbers.
    def _distance(x, y) := ((x < y) + (abs(x - y) < threshold))
    # Return True if any two elements are closer than the threshold
    return any(_distance(n1, n2) for n1, n2 in zip(numbers))
```

This script defines a function `has_close_elements` that checks if any two numbers in the given list are closer than the given threshold. The function uses a lambda function `_distance` to calculate the Euclidean distance between two numbers. The returned value is a boolean that represents the answer to the problem.
