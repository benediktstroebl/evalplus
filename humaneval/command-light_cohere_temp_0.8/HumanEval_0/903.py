Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you described:
```python
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the input list
    numbers.sort()

    -
    
    # Iterate through the list
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):
            # If the two numbers are less than or equal to the threshold, return True
            if numbers[i] <= threshold or numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    
    return False
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than or equal to the threshold.

The function first sorts the input list. Then, it iterates through the list and checks if the current two numbers are less than or equal to the threshold. The function returns True if any of these conditions are met. If none of these conditions are met, the function returns False.

This is a self-contained function that does not require any external variables and can be fully executed within a single Python script.
