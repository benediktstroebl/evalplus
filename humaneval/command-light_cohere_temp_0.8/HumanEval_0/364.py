Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you provided:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Initialize variables
    seen = set()
    result = False
    for num in numbers:
        if num > threshold:
            continue
        if num in seen:
            seen.add(num)
        else:
            seen.add(num)
            result = True
            break
    return result
```
This script defines a function `has_close_elements` that takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold. The script initializes two sets: `seen` (a set to keep track of numbers we have seen) and `result` (a boolean variable to keep track of the result).  It then iterates through the list of numbers, and if a number is greater than the threshold, it will continue iterating. If a number is already in the seen set, it is added to the set. Finally, the function returns the result variable, which is a boolean that is true if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer than the threshold.
