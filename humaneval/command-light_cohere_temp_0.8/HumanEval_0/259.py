```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Initialize a list of booleans with the same length as the numbers list.
    check_list = [False for _ in range(len(numbers))]
    # Loop through each element in the numbers list
    for i, n in enumerate(numbers):
        # If the current number is less than the threshold
        if n < threshold:
            # Set the corresponding element in the check_list to True
            check_list[i] = True
        # Else, if the current number is equal to the threshold
        elif n == threshold:
            # Set the corresponding element in the check_list to True
            check_list[i] = True
    # Check if any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold
    return any(check_list)
```
This Python function has_close_elements takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean value that indicates if any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold. The function uses a boolean list to keep track of the elements that are close to each other.
