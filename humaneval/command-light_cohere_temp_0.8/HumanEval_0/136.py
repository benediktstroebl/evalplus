```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    Do not pass
    has_close_elements([1.0,2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0, threshold=0.1)
    values.
    False
    -
    does not pass the test."""

The function has_close_elements takes two parameters: a List[float] called numbers, which represents a list of numbers, and a float threshold, which is the minimum threshold for the distance between two numbers. 

The function returns a boolean value that indicates whether any two numbers in the list are closer than each other than the given threshold.
