Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of checking if any two numbers in a list are closer to each other than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) is_close_each_other(1.0, 0.0) is less_than_threshold(0.3))

    True
    False
    """

This code uses the List data structure to store a list of numbers and the threshold. It then defines a has_close_elements function that takes in the list of numbers and the threshold as input, and returns a boolean value indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. 

This function uses the two-item comparison in the list to determine if any two numbers are closer to each other than the threshold. The function then returns True if the list contains any two items that are less than the threshold, and False otherwise.
