```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    #using two lists to reduce complexity of the code
    first_nums = list(numbers)[:len(numbers)//2]
    second_nums = list(numbers[len(numbers)//2:])

    #sorting both lists
    first_nums.sort()
    name_order = lambda x: x if x < threshold else x+threshold
    second_nums.sort()

    same to name_order

    #checking if any two elements are equal or in close proximity
    for x,y in zip(first_nums,second_nums):
        if name_order(x)==name_order(y):
            return True
    return False
```

This code defines a function called has_close_elements that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two elements in the list are equal or closer than the threshold. The function achieves this by sorting the list into two halves, comparing each element in one half with the corresponding element in the other half, and checking if the two elements are equal or in close proximity. The code uses a efficient sorting of the list by only reading the list once, which reduces the complexity of the algorithm.
