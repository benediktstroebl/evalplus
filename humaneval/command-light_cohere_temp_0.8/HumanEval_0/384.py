Here's the solution for the problem:

```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x: math.min(x(x, y) for x,y in zip(numbers)))
    # Filter numbers that are less than the threshold
    return [x for x in numbers if x >= threshold]
```

You can use this function to test if the problem has a solution by passing the test cases as arguments, and it should return True if the problem has a solution, and False otherwise.
