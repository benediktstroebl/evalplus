    return any of the following conditions:
        - for any i, j in range(len(numbers)), i != j:
            numbers[i] <= numbers[j] + threshold
        - for any i, j in range(len(numbers)), i != j:
            numbers[i] >= numbers[j] - threshold
        - for any i, j in range(len(numbers)), i, j > 0:
            numbers[i] == numbers[j] + threshold

This script defines a function `has_close_elements` that checks whether any two elements in the given list are closer than the given threshold.  The function returns `True` if any of the above conditions are met, and `False` otherwise.
