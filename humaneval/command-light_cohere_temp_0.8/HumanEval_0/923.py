Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of checking if any two elements in the list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) or different also3 test([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], 0.7, 0.0)
    _)
   ln(1.0, 2.8) < 0.2 < 0.0) < 0.8
   5>True
    case, the numbers are not closer than the threshold. 
""" True
