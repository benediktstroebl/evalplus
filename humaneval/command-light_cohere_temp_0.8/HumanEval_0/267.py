Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of checking if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold:
```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Initialize a set to store elements that are already closer than threshold
    # This will allow for faster lookup and remove duplicate checks.
    set_thresholds = set(threshold)
    
    # Initialize a flag to track if any two elements are closer than threshold
    return any(numbers[i] in set_thresholds for i in range(len(numbers)))
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold. It does this by using a set data structure to store elements that are already closer than the threshold, which allows for faster lookup and removal of duplicates. 

In this approach, it checks for each pair of elements in the list against the threshold, and if any pair is found to be closer, the function returns true. It is use the for the set of elements, this allows for more efficient lookup and removal of duplicate checks, which can improve the performance of the function.
