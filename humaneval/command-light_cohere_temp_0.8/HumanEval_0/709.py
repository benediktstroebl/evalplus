Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you provided:
```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5); 0.8)
    fact be similar
    particular""" function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input. It then loops through the each number in the list and checks if the difference between this number and the next number is less than the threshold. If it meets the the threshold, it means the numbers are close to each other and the function returns True. If not, it returns False. This is an simple, efficient way to solve the problem, as it only checks a small subset of the numbers in the list.
