```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Compute sorted numbers and get the first element
    numbers.sort(numbers)[:0] = sorted(numbers)
    first_element = numbers[0]

    # If the first element is less than the threshold, return True
    if first_element < threshold:
        return True

    # If the first element is equal to the threshold, check if the next elements are closer
    # than the threshold
    for element in numbers[1:]:
        if element <= threshold:
            return True

    return False

# Test cases
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
has_close_elements(numbers, 0.5)  # Output should be True, because numbers are sorted and 1.0 is less than threshold

numbers = [1.8, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
has_close_elements(numbers, 0.2)  # Output should be False, because the sorted numbers are [1.8, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0] and the0.5) is not a threshold.

This solution implements a heuristic approach to solve the problem. It uses a approach of sorting numbers and then checks if the first element is less than the threshold. It then checks if the next elements are less than the threshold. This process continues until it doesn't find any two elements closer to the threshold.
