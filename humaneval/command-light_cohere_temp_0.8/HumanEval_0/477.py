```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] < threshold:
                return True
    return False
``` 
This code implements a function called **`has_close_elements`** that checks whether any two elements in a given list are closer to each other than a given threshold. It iterates over ther list of numbers, and for each pair of adjacent elements, it checks if the difference between them is less than a given threshold. If any such condition is met, it returns **`True`**; otherwise, it returns **`False`**.
