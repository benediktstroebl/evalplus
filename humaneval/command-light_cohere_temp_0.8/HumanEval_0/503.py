```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    Fry's the open elements

    The function works by sorting the numbers in the list and then iterating through the list. It uses the mathematical formula to check if any two numbers are closer to each other than the threshold. 

It returns a boolean value that indicates whether there are any close pairs in the list.
