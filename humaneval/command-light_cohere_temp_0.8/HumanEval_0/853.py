```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)  #.20) is false
    is:
    <  is [1.0, 3.8] in the8. Then it's [1.0, 3.0] and return that for the second condition. 

    then it must be [1.0, 3.8] -> return True because
   + 1.0
   8.7, 20)

>>> True
``` 
The above code defines a function called `has_close_elements` that checks if in a list of numbers, there are any two numbers that are closer to the given threshold. The function returns `True` if the test passes and `False` otherwise.
