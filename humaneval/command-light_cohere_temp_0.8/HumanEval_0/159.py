Here is a self-contained Python function that checks if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ 
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    """
    # Initialize two lists to store the left and right elements
    left_index = 0
    right_index = len(numbers) - 1
    while left_index <= right_index:
        # Calculate the difference between the two numbers
        current_number = numbers[left_index]
        next_number = numbers[right_index]
        difference = next_number - current_number
        # Check if the difference is less than the threshold
        if difference <= threshold:
            # If the difference is less than or equal to the threshold, then return True
            return True
        left_index += 1
        right_index -= 1
    return False
```

This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold. 

The function uses a while loop to compare the left and right elements of the list until it finds a pair of numbers that are not closer than the threshold. 

The function returns False if no such pair is found, and True if a pair of numbers that are closer than the threshold is found. 

This function can be used to check if any two numbers in a list are close to each other, and can be used to solve the problem of determining if any two numbers in a list are close to each other.
