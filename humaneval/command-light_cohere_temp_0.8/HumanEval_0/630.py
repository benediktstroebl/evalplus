Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function to check if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This Python script defines a function `has_close_elements` that takes a list of numbers (`numbers`) and a threshold value (`threshold`) as input. The function iterates over the the list, comparing each pair of consecutive elements. If it finds any two elements within the list that are within a certain threshold of each other, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

You can use this function by passing a list of numbers and a threshold value as arguments, and it will return a boolean indicating whether any close pairs of elements were found in the list.
