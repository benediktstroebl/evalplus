Here's a self-contained Python function that checks if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    """
    return any of the list element comparison function is greater than threshold"""
    return any(x > threshold for x in numbers)
```
Do you need anything else?
