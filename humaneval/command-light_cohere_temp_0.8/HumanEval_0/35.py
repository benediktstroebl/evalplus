```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in the given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than the given threshold.
    The function checks for every pair of numbers in the list that their difference is less than the threshold. If any pair of numbers does not satisfy the condition, the function returns False, indicating that no numbers are close enough. Otherwise, it returns True, indicating that all numbers are far enough.
    """

Any other input that is not a list of float values or does not contain two elements will raise an error.
