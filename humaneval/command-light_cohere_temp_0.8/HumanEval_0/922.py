Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) or someting input!0.5.0.4 is will1 isa.5.0.3
   
   sdf existed above 2.0.0 in the0.6. Because we have afled this same elements, we can directly compare the items. For example, we can compare the numbers in the list numbers and the number threshold. We can then the that if the number threshold is less than the first number, or if the number threshold is greater than the second number, or if the number threshold is greater than the first number, or if the number threshold is greater than the second number, then the return value is True. We can also compare the story on the numbers in the list.
