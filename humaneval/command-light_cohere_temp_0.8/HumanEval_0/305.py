Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in the given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than the threshold.
    """
    list = sorted(numbers, key = lambda x: math.abs(x[x] - abs(y[0]))
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False

# Test the function
has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0, 0.0, 0.0, 3])
return True

```
This function takes a List of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating if any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold. The function uses the list's sorted values and compares them using the subtraction operation, then checks if the difference is less than or equal to the threshold. The test is repeated for each element in the list using two nested loops. If any of these condition is true, the function returns True, otherwise, it returns False.
