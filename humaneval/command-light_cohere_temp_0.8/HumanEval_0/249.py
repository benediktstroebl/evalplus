Here's a self-contained Python function that checks if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Initialize dictionary
    has_close_dict = {}

    # Loop through list
    for i in numbers:
        for j in numbers:
            # If both numbers are in dictionary and they are closer than the threshold, then return True
            if i in has_close_dict and j in has_close_dict and (j - i) <= threshold:
                return True

    # Return False if no two elements are close enough to each other
    return False
```
