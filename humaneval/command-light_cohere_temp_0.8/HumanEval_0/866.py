Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that checks whether any two elements from the given list are closer than each other than the given threshold:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) False
    Maya, close is never met in this list
    """
    return False


# Test the function with sample input
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 5.0, 0.0, 6.0]
Test case: all elements are not close and returned the boolean
has_close_elements(numbers, 0.0)
```
