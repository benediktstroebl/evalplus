Here is a self-contained Python function that checks if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) orGO!73.0?erts't be a8A operate list"""

if any(numbers[i] <= threshold for i in range(len(numbers) - 1)) is True:
    return True
else:
    return False
```
The provided Python function checks if any two numbers in the given list are closer than a given threshold. It returns True if any pair of numbers in the list is within the threshold, indicating that no two numbers are close to each other. The function returns False if no such open pairs are found.

The function works by checking each pair of numbers in the list against the given threshold. It uses the list comprehension and the built-in Python function `any()` to check if there are any elements in the list that are less than or equal to the given threshold.
