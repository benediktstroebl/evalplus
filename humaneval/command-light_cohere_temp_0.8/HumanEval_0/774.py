Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of checking if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
   
    In this function, we use the "distance" between two numbers to check if they are closer than the threshold.
    }"
    The function also returns True if the distance is less than the threshold
    """
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
The above Python code defines a function called `has_close_elements` that takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input. It then iterates through two loops: first, it checks if any elements in the list are closer than the last element, and the second loop checks if any elements in the list are closer than the first element. The function returns `True` if any elements are closer than the threshold.
