```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list of numbers in ascending order.
    numbers.sort(key=lambda x: -x)

    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] < threshold:
                return False
    return True
```
This function takes two arguments: numbers, which is the input list of numbers, and threshold, which is the minimum distance between two elements that are allowed to be close to each other.

It uses a nested loop to iterate through the list of numbers, and checks if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the given threshold. If it finds any such partnership, it returns False, indicating that the list does not have any elements that are close to each other. If it completes the approach without finding such close elements, it returns True, indicating that the list has no elements that are close to each other.
