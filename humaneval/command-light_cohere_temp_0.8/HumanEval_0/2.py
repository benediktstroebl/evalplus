Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of checking if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Initialize a dictionary to store the current and previous distances
    current_distance = {key: float('inf') for key in numbers}
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            # Calculate the difference between the two numbers
            current_distance[numbers[i]] = numbers[i] - numbers[j]
            
            # Check if the current distance is less than the threshold
            if current_distance[numbers[i]] < threshold:
                return True
                
    # If all distances are greater than the threshold, return False
    return False

# Test the function
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 8, 0.0]
threshold = 0.1

result = has_close_elements(numbers, threshold)
print(result)
```

This code defines a function called `has_close_elements` that takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input. It initializes a dictionary `current_distance` to store the current and previous distances of each number in the list. Then, it iterates over the list of numbers and for each pair of numbers, it calculates the difference between the two numbers and updates the current distance accordingly. Finally, it checks if the current distance is less than the threshold and returns True, indicating that there are elements in the list that are closer than the threshold.
