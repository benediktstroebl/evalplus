Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you've described:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[i] - numbers[i + 1] < threshold:
            return True
    return False
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold. It uses a nested loop to iterate over the list of numbers, and checks if the difference between the current number and the next number is less than the threshold. The function returns True if any condition is met, and False otherwise.
