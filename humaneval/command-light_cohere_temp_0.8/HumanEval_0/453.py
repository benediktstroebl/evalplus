Here is a Python function that checks whether any two elements in the list are closer than a given threshold:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Set a flag to track if we have found two elements with a closer distance than threshold
    seen_elements = False
    
    # Loop through the list of numbers
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            # Check if both numbers are in the list
            if numbers[i] == numbers[j]:
                # If so, check if the absolute difference between the two numbers is less than the threshold
                if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold:
                    seen_elements = True
                    break
    
    # If we have found two elements with a closer distance than threshold
    return seen_elements

# Test the function
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 5.0, 2.0, 0.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8, 9.0, 10, 8, 8, 6]
threshold = 0.2
has_close_elements(numbers, threshold)
``` 
This script defines a function called `has_close_elements` that takes in two parameters: a list of numbers and a threshold value. The function checks if there are any two elements in the list that are closer than the given threshold. It uses a Python's set to track if it has found two elements with a closer distance than the threshold.
