Here is a self-contained Python function that checks if any two elements in the list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort(key=lambda x: (x<threshold) + (x>numbers[0]))
    # Check if any two numbers are closer than the threshold
    for i in range(1,len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i+1,len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i]-numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```

This function first sorts the input list of numbers. Then, it iterates over the range, comparing each pair of numbers in the list, and checks if the difference between them is less than or equal to the given threshold.
