Here's the code:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether there are any two numbers in the list that are closer to each other than the threshold. The function uses a loop to iterate over the list of numbers and for each pair of adjacent numbers, it checks if the difference between them is less than the threshold. The function returns True if any of the conditions are met, otherwise, it returns False.
