```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # convert list of float to set
    numbers = set(numbers)
    # return True if there are any two elements in the set that are less than the given threshold
    return len(numbers) > 1 and numbers.0 < numbers <= threshold
```
This Python function checks if any two elements in a given list are closer than a given threshold. The function takes in two arguments: a list of numbers and a threshold value. The function then converts the list of float to a set, which means that the elements in the list are treated as distinct. It then checks if there are any two elements in the set that are less than the given threshold. The function returns True if there are any such, and False otherwise.
