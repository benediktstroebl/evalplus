Here's the answer:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Initialize a set to store the distance between all pairs of numbers
    distances = {(num1, num2): math.abs(num1 -num2) for num1, num2 in zip(numbers)}
    
    # Initialize a set to store all numbers that are within the threshold
    close_numbers = [num for num in numbers if distances[num, num] <= threshold]
    
    # Initialize a boolean indicating whether any close numbers were found
    has_close_elements = close_numbers and set()
    
    # Check if there are any close numbers
    return has_close_elements
```
This Python code defines a function named has_close_elements that checks if a given list of numbers contains any pair closer than a specified threshold. The function employs the mathematical distance calculations between pairs of numbers and a set of numbers that fall within a given threshold. 

The code also uses the List[float] type, which allows for floating-point numbers, and the threshold parameter is of type float.
