Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function called `has_close_elements`, which checks if any two elements in the given list of numbers are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in numbers:
        for j in numbers:
            if abs(i - j) < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```

This function takes two parameters: `numbers`, which is a list of float numbers, and `threshold`, which is a float value. The function returns `True` if any two elements in the list are closer than the given threshold, and `False` otherwise. 

You can use this function to solve the problem of finding if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold.
