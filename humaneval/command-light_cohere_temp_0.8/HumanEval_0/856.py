```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than the given threshold
    """
    return any(abs(n1 - n2) <= threshold for n1, n2 in zip(numbers))
```
The above code defines a function called `has_close_elements` that checks if any two numbers in a given list are closer than a certain threshold. It uses the specific comparison operator (`<=`) with the threshold parameter to check if the absolute difference between two numbers is less than or equal to the threshold value.
