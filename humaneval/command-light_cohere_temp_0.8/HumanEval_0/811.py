Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:

```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold
    """
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):
            if abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j]) < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `has_close_elements` that takes a list of numbers (`numbers`) and a threshold value (`threshold`) as input. It returns a
True if any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold. 

The function uses a nested loop to iterate through pairs of numbers in the list. It checks if the is an element in the list is smaller than the current element, then returns True.  It function is designed to run in an environment where the `type` module is imported, and uses the `List` and `float` types.  It language, with `has_close_elements` you can solve the problem of checking if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold.
