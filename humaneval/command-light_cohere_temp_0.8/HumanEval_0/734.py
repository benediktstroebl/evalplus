Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    # Initialize two variables
    first = numbers[0]
    last = numbers[-1]
    # Initialize an empty set to store the close pairs
    close_pairs = set()
    # Loop through the list of numbers
    for num in numbers:
        # Compare the current number to the last
        if num < last - threshold:
            # If the current number is smaller than the last, add it to the set
            close_pairs.add(first,last)
            first,last = num
        else:
            # If the current number is larger than or equal to the last, skip it
            pass
    # Check if there are any close pairs in the set
    return close_pairs != set()
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether there are any two numbers in the list that are closer than each other than the threshold. The function uses the two variables, first and last, to keep track of the two numbers that are closest to each other and adds them to the close_pairs set.
