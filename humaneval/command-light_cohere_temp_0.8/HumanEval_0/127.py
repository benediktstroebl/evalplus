Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function to check for the presence of adjacent numbers within a list that are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) is0)
   2)
    """

    For each element in the list of numbers, checks if the difference between this element and the next element is less than the given threshold. If the condition is met, the function returns True, indicating the presence of at least two elements that are close to each other. Otherwise, it returns False.

```

This function takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean value indicating whether there are any pairs of elements in the list that are closer than the given threshold.
