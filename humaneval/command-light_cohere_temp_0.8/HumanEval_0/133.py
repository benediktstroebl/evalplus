```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    """
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[i] - numbers[i + 1] < threshold:
            return True
    return False
``` 
This code defines a Python function called `has_close_elements`, which takes two arguments: a list of numbers (`numbers`) and a threshold value (`threshold`). It aims to determine if any two consecutive elements in the list are closer than the specified threshold. 

The `for` loop iterates over the list of numbers, comparing each pair of consecutive elements. If the difference between any two consecutive elements is less than the threshold, the function returns `True`, indicating that there are elements in the list that are closer than the threshold. 

On the other hand, if the loop completes without finding such a pair, the function returns `False`, implying no such elements were found within the list. 

This approach effectively checks for the presence of close elements within the given list, using a common-sense comparison criterion.
