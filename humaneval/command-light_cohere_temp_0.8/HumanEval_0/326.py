```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    :param numbers: List[float] - list of numbers to check
    :param threshold: float - threshold value
    :return: bool - True if any two elements in numbers are closer than threshold, otherwise False
    """
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):

    return False
```

This function has_close_elements takes in a List[float] called numbers and a threshold value as inputs, and returns a bool indicating whether any two elements in the numbers list are closer than the threshold.

This function uses nested loops to iterate over the range of elements in the numbers list and compare each element to the next one. If the difference between the needed element and the next one is less than the threshold, the function returns True, indicating that there are close elements.

This function could be used to validate markdown code blocks by checking if the elements in the code block are closer than each other.
