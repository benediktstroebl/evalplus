```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    """
    return any set of two numbers in the list have a difference less than the given threshold."""
    
    return any(abs(x - y) < threshold for x, y in zip(numbers))
```
This script defines a function called has_close_elements, which accepts a list of numbers, called numbers, and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two elements in the list are closer than the threshold.

This is a sample of how to implement the algorithm in Python. The function returns true if any two elements from the list have a difference less than the given threshold.
