Here is a self-contained Python function that checks if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    due.
    """
   0
    template with one liner:
    """
    return any(x == y for x, y in numbers if abs(x - y) <= threshold)
```
This function is self-contained and does not require any external modules or functions.
