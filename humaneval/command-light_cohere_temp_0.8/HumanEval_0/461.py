Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers)-1):
        for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[j] - numbers[i] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This function uses two nested loops to compare every pair of elements in the list. The loop from `numbers` iterates over each number, except the last one, while the loop from `j` iterates over the rest of the list. This process checks if the final number of the current pair is less than the opening number of the previous pair, and the difference is smaller than the threshold. The function returns `True` to pass the test and returns `True`.

This function can be used as a great starting point for solving the problem. It is then that you can test it with your own markdown code block to see if it passes the test.
