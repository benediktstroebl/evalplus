Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you have provided:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
   3
   05
   0, 0.0, 2.0, 0.5) is 0.3), any values that passed out for every threshold <= 0.4
   3.0
    return False
    advantage if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than 0.4, and the threshold is 0.3, they will be considered to be close to each other.
    return True
Another advantage is that you can pass any type of data to the function, and it will automatically convert the data to a float type.
