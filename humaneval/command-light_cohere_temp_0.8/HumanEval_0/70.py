Here is a Python script that checks if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold:
```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return False
    try:
        return any(num1 - num2 > threshold for num1, num2 in zip(numbers))
    except TypeError:
        return False
```
This function uses the Python type hint `List[float]` and the function signature `def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to indicate that the function expects a list of numbers and a float threshold. The function also includes a try block to check if the list is empty, and if it is, the function will return `False` to indicate that the function does not solve the problem.

The function also includes a except `TypeError` block to catch any exceptions that may occur during the function's execution. The function will then return `False` in such cases to handle any errors gracefully.
