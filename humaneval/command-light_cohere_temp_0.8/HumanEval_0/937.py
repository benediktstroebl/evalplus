```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[i] - numbers[i+1] < threshold:
            return True
    return False
```
This Python function checks if any two consecutive elements in a list of numbers are closer to each other than a given threshold. It iterates through through a loop over the elements, and for each pair of elements, it compares their values and checks if the difference is less than the threshold. If any such condition is met, the function returns True, indicating that there are elements with close values. Otherwise, it returns False.
