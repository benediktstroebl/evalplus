Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
   TH's.5)?"aSdfh,t_t would be easier to use, so I'll pass a type List[float] and a threshold float to the function.
