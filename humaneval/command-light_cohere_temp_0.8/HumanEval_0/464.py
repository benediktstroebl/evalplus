Here's a Python script that provides a self-contained function that checks for the presence of any two numbers within a given list that are closer than each other than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.0) will False
    approach: 1e
    For a more thorough test, you can also check for pairs of elements that are less than the threshold apart from each other.
