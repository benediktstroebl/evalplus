Here's the self-contained Python script that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort()
    
    # i, j = i + 1
        while j < len(numbers) and numbers[i] < threshold and numbers[j] < threshold:
            numbers[i], numbers[j] = numbers[j], numbers[i]
            i, j = j, i + 1
    
    return True
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold. 
The function sorts the list of numbers and then uses a while loop to compare each number to the next one, until it finds a number that is greater than the threshold. 
The function then swaps the numbers and moves to the next number. 
Finally, the function returns True if any two numbers were closer than the threshold, otherwise, it returns False.
