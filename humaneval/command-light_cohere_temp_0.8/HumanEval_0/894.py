Here's a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of checking if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list of numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort()
   
    first, second, third...

    # Do a binary search to find the first element that is less than the threshold
    left_bound = 0
    right_bound = len(numbers) - 1
    while left_bound <= right_bound:
        current_element = numbers[left_bound]
        if current_element < threshold:
            left_bound += 1
        else:
            break
    if left_bound >= right_bound:
        return False
    return True
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two elements in the list are closer than the threshold. The function first sorts the use the binary search to find the first element in the list that is less than the threshold.
