```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort()
   
    first_pair = tuple(sorted(numbers))
    # check for pairs of elements in list that are closer than the threshold
    for i in range(2):
        if numbers[i] - numbers[i + 1] < threshold:
            return True
    return False
```
This script defines a function that checks whether a given list of numbers contains any pair of elements that are closer than a given threshold. The function uses the sorting the first two elements of the list and then checks if their difference is smaller than the threshold.
