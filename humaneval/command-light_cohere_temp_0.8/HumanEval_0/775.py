Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you have provided:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) is False
   F
   
    threshold values will also be considered as close enough.
    """return any([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]) >= threshold and?arcball: For any combination of three values in the list that are greater than the given threshold. 
    """return any([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]) >= threshold

    """return True
```
This function will first convert the function to a list using the `List` function. It then checks if any combination of the first, middle, and last element in the list is greater than the threshold. 

The function will return `True` if the condition is met, and `False` otherwise.
