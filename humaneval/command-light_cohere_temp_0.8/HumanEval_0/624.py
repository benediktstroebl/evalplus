```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Initialize a set of close numbers
    numbers = set(numbers)
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers.isclose closest(numbers[i], numbers[j], threshold):
                return True
    return False
```
This script defines a function that determines whether any two numbers in a given list are closer than a given threshold. It does so by transforming the list of numbers into a set, and then iterating through the list to determine if any two numbers are within the given threshold of each other. The function returns True if any two numbers are found to be close to each other, and returns False if not.
