Here is a Python function that checks if any two elements in the given list are closer to each other than the given threshold:

```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in the given list of numbers, any two elements are closer than a given threshold.
    """
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[i] < numbers[i+1] < threshold:
            return True
    return False
```

This function checks if any two elements are closer than the given threshold, and returns True. It uses the approach to iterate over the list and check if the elements at the current index are less than the elements at the next index, then it checks the condition and returns True. 
This function can be used to verify if the provided markdown code blocks are correct and meets the criteria of being a self-contained Python function.
