Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you've described:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort()

   
    values = numbers[::collect(threshold)]
    # Return True if the list contains two elements with a smaller value than the threshold
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] < numbers[j] < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This code defines a function `has_close_elements` that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns `True` if the list contains two elements with a smaller value than the threshold, otherwise it returns `False`. 

The function first sorts the list of numbers. Then, it creates a new list called `values` that contains only the elements that are smaller than the threshold. Finally, the function returns `True` if the `values` list contains at least two elements with a smaller value than the threshold.
