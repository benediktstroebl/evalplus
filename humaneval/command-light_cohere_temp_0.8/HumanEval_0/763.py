Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of checking for elements that are closer than a given threshold in a list of numbers:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Initialize a set to hold the closest element to the threshold
    candidates = {num for num in numbers if abs(num - threshold) <= 1}
    
    # Filter out any elements that do not have the closest match
    return len(candidates) > 0 and candidates != numbers
```

This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold. The function uses a set data structure to hold the elements in the list that are closest to the threshold, and then uses the membership query operator to check if the set contains any of the other elements in the list.
