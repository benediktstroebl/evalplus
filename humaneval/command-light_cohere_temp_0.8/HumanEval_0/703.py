```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    Return: True if there are two numbers in the list that are closer to each other than the given threshold, otherwise False
    """
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[i] - numbers[i + 1] < threshold:
            return True
    return False
``` 
The code implements a function called **`has_close_elements`** that checks whether any two consecutive elements in the given list are closer to each other than a given threshold. The function uses a loop to iterate over the list of numbers and if the difference between the current two numbers is smaller than the given threshold, it returns **`True`**. Otherwise, it returns **`False`**.  This function can be used to check if the given list contains any pairs of numbers that are closer to each other than a given threshold.
