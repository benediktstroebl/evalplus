Here's the solution to the problem:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort(key=lambda x: (x<threshold and x not in numbers[:-len-1:]))
    # Loop over the sorted list
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i, len(numbers)):
            # Check if the elements are closer than the threshold
            if numbers[i] + numbers[j] < threshold:
                return True
    return False

# Test
numbers = [1.5, 3, 2, 6, 8, 1.0]
threshold = 0.3
if has_close_elements(numbers,threshold):
    print("Solution passed!")
```

This solution sorts the list of numbers and then checks if the two current numbers are closer than the threshold. This approach can be optimized for a large list of numbers by using a binary search instead of a linear search.
