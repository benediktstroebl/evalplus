Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of determining if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```

The function has_close_elements takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold. 

The function uses a nested loop to compare each pair of numbers in the list and returns True if any pair of numbers is closer than the given threshold. 
The function is self-contained, meaning it does not require any external functions or variables to be called, and it can be called directly. 
The function passes the corresponding tests.
