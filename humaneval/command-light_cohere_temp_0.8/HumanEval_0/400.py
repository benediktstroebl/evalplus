Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of checking if any two numbers in a list are closer to each other than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) False)
     other

    return True  # All numbers in the list are larger than the threshold
    """
    return all(x > threshold for x in numbers)

# Example usage
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 5.0, 2.0]
threshold = 0.3
print(has_close_elements(numbers, threshold))
```

This script defines a function `has_close_elements` that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold. The function uses the all function to check if all elements in the list are larger than the threshold, and returns True.

This function can be used to quickly check if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold, which can be useful for a variety of mathematical and data analysis tasks.
