Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you provided:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    # Return True if there are any two elements with a distance less than the threshold, otherwise False
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] < threshold:
                return True
    return False

# Test the function
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 5.0, 2.0]
has_close_elements(numbers, 0.0)
print(has_close_elements(numbers, 0.0)) # Output should be True
```
The function checks if there are any two elements in the list with a distance less than the threshold. The function returns True if there are any elements that satisfy this condition.
