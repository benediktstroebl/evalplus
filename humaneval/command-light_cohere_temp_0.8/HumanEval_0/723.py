This Python script defines a function has_close_elements that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input. It then checks if any two consecutive elements in the list are closer than the threshold. If the condition is met, it returns True, indicating that the list contains at least two elements that are close to each other. Otherwise, it returns False.

This code uses the typing module to provide type hints and improves the readability of the code.
