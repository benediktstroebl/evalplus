Here's the solution:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Initialize a counter for the current number in the list
    counter = 0

    # Loop through the list
    for num in numbers:
        # If the current number is less than the threshold, no closer matches found yet
        if num < threshold:
            continue

        # Increment the counter for the current number
        counter += 1

        # If the current number is equal to the threshold, a closer match was found
        if num == threshold:
            return True

    # If no closer match was found for any number in the list
    return False

# Example usage:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]

threshold = 0.1

result = has_close_elements(numbers, threshold)  # Output True
```

This code defines a function **`has_close_elements`** that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold. The function uses a counter to keep track of the number of times a particular number occurs and if the number is equal to the threshold, it returns true, indicating that a closer match was found. The function also initializes the number counter and loops through the list to check if any number is closer to the threshold than the current number.
