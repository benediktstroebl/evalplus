Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of checking if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort()
   
    same, threshold
    # Check if any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two elements in the list are closer than the threshold. 

The function first sorts the list of numbers. It then checks if any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold. If any such, the two numbers are within the threshold, the function returns True. If no such such of these conditions are met, the function returns False.
