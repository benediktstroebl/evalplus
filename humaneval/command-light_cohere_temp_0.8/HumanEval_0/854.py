Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of checking if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This script defines a function has_close_elements that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating if any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold. The script uses a loop to iterate through the list of numbers and compare each pair of elements with the threshold. The function returns True if any element is less than any other element in the range. This meets the condition for two numbers to be considered close.
