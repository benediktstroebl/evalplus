```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    numbers = [float] + numbers  # type hint to convert list to array
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):

```
This Python script defines a function, `has_close_elements`, which determines if any two numbers in a given list are closer than a specified threshold. It does so by converting the list of numbers into a one-dimensional array and then iterating through pairs of consecutive elements. The script uses the mathematical square root to compare the differences between consecutive numbers in each pair and checks if the difference is less than the given threshold.
