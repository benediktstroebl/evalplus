```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in the list of numbers, any two consecutive elements are closer than the given threshold.
    Returns True if there are any two elements that meet the criteria, False otherwise.
    """return any(numbers[0] > threshold and numbers[1] > threshold) and numbers[0] <= numbers[1])```

This function takes two parameters: numbers, which is a list of float numbers, and threshold, which is a float value. It returns a boolean value, which is True if there are any two elements in the list that are greater than the threshold. The function uses the mathematical condition to check if the two consecutive elements are closer than the threshold.
