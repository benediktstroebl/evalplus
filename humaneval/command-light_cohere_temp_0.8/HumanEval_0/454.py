Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Initialize variables and parameters.
    close = False  # Flag to check if any two elements in the list are closer than the threshold.
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold:
                close = True
                break
    return close
```
This function takes two arguments: numbers and threshold. It uses two nested loops to iterate over the list of numbers and checks if any two adjacent elements are closer than the threshold. If the condition is true, the function returns True, indicating that the elements are close enough. If the loop completes without finding a close pair, the function returns False.
