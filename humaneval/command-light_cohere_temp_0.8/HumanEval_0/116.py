```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold:
                return True
    return False

# Test
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]

result = has_close_elements(numbers, 0.5)
print(result)
``` 
The code defines a function called `has_close_elements` that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input. It then iterates over the two pointers of the list, and checks if the absolute difference between the two numbers is less than the threshold. The function returns `True` if any pair of numbers is closer than the threshold, and returns `False` otherwise.  The function is tested by passing a list of numbers and a threshold of 0.5 to it, and the result is printed to the console.
