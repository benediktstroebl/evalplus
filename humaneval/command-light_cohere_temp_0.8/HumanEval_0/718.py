Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of checking for elements in a list that are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `has_close_elements` that takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input. It then iterates through two pointers, `i` and `j`, over the list of numbers, and checks if the difference between the two elements at those pointers is less than the threshold. This will return True if the done for all pairs in the list.
