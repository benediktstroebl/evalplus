Here's a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list of numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x:x)
    # Initialize two lists to store the indices of the two closest numbers
    close_indices = []
    distant_indices = []
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        if numbers[i] < threshold:
            close_indices.append(i)
        distant_indices.append(i)

    # Sort the lists in descending order to get the closest pairs
    close_indices.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda j: j[1])
    distant_indices.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda j: j[1])

    # Check if the two closest elements are within the threshold
    if close_indices[0] == distant_indices[0]:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This function has_close_elements takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list contains any two numbers that are closer to each other than the threshold.  The function first sorts the list in ascending order and then, for each number in the list, it checks if the number is smaller than the threshold. If the number is smaller, it adds its index to the close_indices list. Then, the function sorts the lists in descending order to get the closest pairs and adds the indices to the distant_indices list. Finally, the function checks if the two closest elements are within the threshold or not, and returns True or False accordingly.
