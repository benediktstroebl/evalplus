Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    #use two pointers to sort the list
    num1 = numbers[0]
    num2 = numbers[1]
    i = 2
    while i < len(numbers):
        if numbers[i] - num1 < threshold:
            num1 = numbers[i]
        elif numbers[i] - num2 < threshold:
            num2 = numbers[i]
        i += 1
    return num1 == num2
```

This code is a Python script that checks if two consecutive elements in a given list are closer to each other than a given threshold. The code implements this function has two pointers that sort the list, and it keeps swapping the two elements until the difference between the two elements is larger than the threshold. The code then returns True, if the two elements are the same after the loop.

Note: This script is fully self-contained and does not require any external functions or modules.
