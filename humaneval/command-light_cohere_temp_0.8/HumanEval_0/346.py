Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of determining if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```

This code defines a function that checks if two numbers in a list are close to each other. The function compares the numbers and returns True if they are within a certain threshold of each other. 

The function has been designed to be self-contained, and it does not rely on any other functions or variables outside of it.
