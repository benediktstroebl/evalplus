Here is a self-contained Python function that checks if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    The function checks if any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold. It does so by using the function absolute, Euclidean distance between two numbers in the list and then checks if the distance is less than the given threshold.
   
The function returns True if any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold, False otherwise.
