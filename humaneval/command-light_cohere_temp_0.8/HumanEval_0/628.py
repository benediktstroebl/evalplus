Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of checking if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Define a new list to store elements that will be added to the result
    result = []
    # Loop through the list of numbers and check if two are close enough to each other
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            # Check if two elements are closer than threshold
            if numbers[i] + numbers[j] < threshold:
                result.append((numbers, numbers[i], numbers[j]))
    # Return the result list
    return result
```
This code defines a function called has_close_elements that takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean value that is True if any two elements in the input list are closer than the threshold, otherwise False. 
The function uses a nested loop to iterate through the list of numbers and checks if the difference between each pair of elements is less than the threshold. It then appends the fact to a new list, which is the result. 
The function returns the list as the result, which contains the pair of elements that are closer than the threshold.
