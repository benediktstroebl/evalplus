Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function `has_close_elements` that checks if any two elements in the list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # check all pairs of elements in the list against the threshold
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This code implements a function `has_close_elements` that checks whether any two elements in the list are closer than a given threshold. It uses a `List` type to iterate over all pairs of elements in the list and checks if the difference between any two elements is less than or equal to the given threshold.
