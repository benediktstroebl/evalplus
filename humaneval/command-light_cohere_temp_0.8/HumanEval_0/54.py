Here is a self-contained Python function that checks whether any two elements in the list are closer than a given threshold:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold

    if any(sorted(numbers)[:-len(numbers)//2] <= threshold):
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Test the function
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 5.0, 2.0]
print("The function returned True")
```

In the above Python code, the function has_close_elements takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input. It uses the sorted() function to sort the first half of the numbers, then checks whether any of the sorted numbers are less than or equal to the given threshold.

This function returns True if any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold, and False otherwise.
