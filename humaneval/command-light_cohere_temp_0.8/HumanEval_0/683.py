```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the input list
    numbers.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x: math.sqrt(x**2) + x**2) 

    # Sorting works in descending order, to keep the closest numbers together.
    return [sorted(numbers, reverse=False)[index1, index2] = (numbers.count(threshold),maximum_distance(numbers[0],numbers[1])),  (numbers.count(threshold))

    # We return if any two numbers are closer to each other than the threshold. We check this two numbers in the list, so we can use tuple unpacking to access the two numbers.
    return = index1 + index2
    return True
``` 
This function uses a threshold value to determine if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The function first sorts the list in descending order, and then uses the sorted list to determine if there are any two numbers that are closer to each other than the threshold.
