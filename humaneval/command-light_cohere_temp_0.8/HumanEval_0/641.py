def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 3], 0.3) are the five.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 3, are numbers that are already close to the given threshold.
