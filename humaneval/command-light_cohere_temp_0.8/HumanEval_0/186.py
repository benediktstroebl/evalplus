Here is a Python function that checks if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```

This function works by looping over the list, comparing each element to the next one. If any comparison result is less than the threshold, it returns True. The function can be tested by passing a list of numbers and a threshold value, and returns a boolean indicating if any close pairs were found. 

This is a self-contained function, meaning it doesn't require any external functions or classes to work.
