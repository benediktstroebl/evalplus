Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of checking for elements that are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Remove all duplicates
    numbers = list(set(numbers))
    
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort(key=lambda x:math.max(x - x, threshold))
    
    # Return True, if two elements are closer than the threshold
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] < threshold:
                return True
    
    return False

# Test
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 5.0]
threshold = 0.3

print(has_close_elements(numbers, threshold))
```
This function has a list of numbers as its input, and a float as its threshold. It first removes all duplicates from the list of numbers. Then, it sorts the list of numbers in ascending order based on the elements' values and the threshold. Finally, it returns True if any two elements are closer than the threshold, otherwise, it returns False.
