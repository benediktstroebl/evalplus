Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you provided:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.3)
    would result True? specialty function to check if elements are close to each other, using a threshold to determine what is close.
    >
    create a own variable 'n' and 'm' to represent the first and second elements of the list, respectively. initial the value of 'numbers' to check for this condition. Then, the function checks if the value of 'n' is less than the value of 'm' and 'm' is less than the value of 'n' plus the threshold. Finally, if this condition is met, the function returns True. If the condition is not met, it returns False.
