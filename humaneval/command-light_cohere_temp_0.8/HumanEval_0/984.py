Here's the solution:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the input list in ascending order
    numbers.sort(key=lambda x: x)
    # Initialize a counter
    count = 0
    # Iterate through the sorted list
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):
            # Check if the current and next numbers are closer than the threshold
            if numbers[i] <= numbers[j] + threshold and numbers[i] >= numbers[j] - threshold:
                count += 1
    return count > 1

# Test the function
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0, 0.8, 6.0, 8, 9.0, 10]
result = has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) isfalse
05.
```

This script defines a function called `has_close_elements` that takes in two parameters: a list of numbers (`numbers`) and a threshold (`threshold`). It sorts the numbers list in ascending order. Then, it iterates through the list and checks if the current number is less than or equal to the next number plus the threshold and vice versa. It increases the counter if the condition is met. Finally, it returns `True` if the counter is greater than 1.

The `test` function is used to test the `has_close_elements` function with a sample list of numbers and a threshold. The function returns `True` which all the numbers in the list are closer than the threshold.
