Here is a self-contained Python script that provides a function to solve the problem:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
   0.5)
   0.0.3),
    general numbers. The definition of the has two conditions:
        1. any numbers in the list must be of the same type (float in this case).
        2. the two numbers must be closer than the given threshold, which is a float.
"
    If the function receives a list of numbers and a threshold as input. It returns a true if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer than each other than the threshold. The function uses the mathematical distance between two numbers to determine if they are closer. 

The function then returns the result as a boolean value.
