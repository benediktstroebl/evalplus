Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the input list of numbers
    numbers.sort()
   
    with nums:=sorted(numbers):
    # Iterate and check if any two adjacent elements are closer than the threshold
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
            if abs(nums[i]-nums[j]) < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```

The function takes two parameters: `numbers`, which is the input list of numbers, and `threshold`, which is the minimum distance between two numbers that can be considered as close. The function returns `True` if any two adjacent elements in the input list are closer than the given `threshold`, and returns `False` otherwise.
