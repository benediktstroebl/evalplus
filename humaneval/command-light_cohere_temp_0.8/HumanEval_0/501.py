Here is a self-contained Python function that checks if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Compute the absolute difference between each pair of numbers in the list.
    diffs = [(abs(x - y), x, y) for x, y in zip(numbers)]

    # Sort the diff list by the difference value in descending order
    diffs.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    # Check if any two elements are closer than the threshold
    for i, close in enumerate(diffs):
        if close[0] < threshold:
            return True

    return False

```
This function takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two elements in the list are closer than the threshold. It uses the difference between each pair of numbers in the list to determine whether any two elements are closer than the threshold. The function then sorts the difference list by the difference value in descending order and then checks if any two elements in the list are closer than the threshold. The function returns True if any two elements are closer than the threshold, otherwise, it returns False.
