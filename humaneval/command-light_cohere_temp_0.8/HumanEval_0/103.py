Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem of finding pairs of elements that are closer than a given threshold in a list of numbers:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Initialize an empty set to store elements that are closer than the threshold
    close_set = set()

    # Loop through the list of numbers and check if each pair is closer than the threshold
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] < numbers[j] - threshold:
                close_set.add(numbers[i], numbers[j])

    # Return True if there are any elements in the set
    return close_set and len(close_set) > 1
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean value indicating whether any two elements in the list are closer than the threshold. The function uses a set data structure to efficiently store elements that are closer than the threshold, and returns True if there are any elements in the set.

The function can be used to check if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold, and can be used to solve a variety of problems that involve finding pairs of elements that are close to each other.
