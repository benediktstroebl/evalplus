Here is a Python script that implements a self-contained function `has_close_elements` which determines if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort()
    important for thetime and efficiency of the function.
    # Define the tuple of two numbers as a set, then check for any set with another tuple in the list
    # If the set with the other tuple contains any number in the list, return True
    # If the set with the other tuple does not contain any number in the list, return False
    # If no other tuizations were found, return False
    return any(set(n1, n2) for n1, n2 in zip(numbers))
than threshold)
```
