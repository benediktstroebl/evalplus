Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you described:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sorting the input list of numbers
    numbers.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x:x)
    # Loop to compare adjacent elements
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i):
            if numbers[j] - numbers[i] < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This script defines a function that checks if any two adjacent elements in a list are closer than a given threshold. It achieves this by first sorting the list and then comparing adjacent elements. The function returns `True` if any of these conditions are met, indicating that the list contains elements that are closer than the given threshold.
