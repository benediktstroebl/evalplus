```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) <= threshold:
                return True
    return False

# Test
# Example list of numbers with 2 close to each other.
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 5.0, 2.0, 6.0]
has_close_elements(numbers, 1)
``` 
The has_close_elements function checks if any two numbers in the given list are closer than a given threshold. The function uses two nested loops to iterate over the list of numbers and compare each pair of elements. The function returns True if any two numbers are closer than the threshold. 

The function is designed to work with a list of floating-point numbers and a threshold. It returns True if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer than the threshold, and False otherwise.
