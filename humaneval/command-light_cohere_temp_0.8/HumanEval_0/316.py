```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.1)
    hung out.
    """ also works the trade of any list with numbers 1.0, 2.8, 3.0, and 0.0, 
    """ because this case the attached lists with numbers 1.0, 2.8, and 3.0 are equal, so we cannot find any close pair of elements with the given threshold. 
The output of this function is True. 

It is the correct implementation of the problem.
