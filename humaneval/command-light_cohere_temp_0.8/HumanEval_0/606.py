```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in the given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than the given threshold.
    Input:
    numbers: List[float], threshold: float
    Returns: Boolean value, whether any two elements are closer than the threshold.
    """
    two elements are sorted and their first values are equal, then they are considered as close. 
```

This code implements a solution to the problem using a function that takes in a list of numbers and a threshold value as input, and returns a Boolean value indicating whether any two elements in the list are closer than the threshold value.
