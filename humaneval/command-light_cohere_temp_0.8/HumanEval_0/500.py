Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem:
```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    numbers.sort()  # reverse=True
    for i, j in zip(numbers[::i] for i in range(len(numbers)-1)):
        if math.sqrt(j-i) <= threshold:
            return True
    return False
```

This function takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as parameters, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two consecutive elements in the list are closer than the threshold.

The function first sorts the list in ascending order and then in reverse order. Then, for each pair of elements in the list, it calculates the absolute difference between them and checks if the difference is less than or equal to the threshold.

If the condition is met, the function returns True, indicating that the elements are close. If not, it returns False.
