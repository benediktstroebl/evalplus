```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
   0
    Dry, but simple 
    comparison,
    we will use the distance between two numbers. 
    The following formula will be used: 
    (a,b) in [1.0,2.0] is [a,b]
    """ in the list given, 
    we will return true if a number is after the b in the list and 
    a number c is in the list of numbers, 
    because a is closer than b than the threshold. 

can be solved by the following: 
```python 
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for b, c in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]):
        if abs(b - c) < threshold:
            return True
    return False
``` 
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold.
