```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    """
    # use two pointers to iterate through the list
    # compare each number with the next until the pointer exceeds end of list
    # check if the current and next numbers are less than threshold
    # if true, then there are numbers close to each other
    return True

# test the function with sample inputs
numbers = [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 0.8, 4.0, 5.0, 2.8]
threshold = 0.3)
has_close_elements(numbers, 0.3)
``` 
This code defines a function called has_close_elements, which takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean value indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold. The function uses two pointers to iterate through the list, and checks if the current and next numbers are less than the threshold. If they are, then the function returns True, indicating that there are numbers close to each other. The test is then passed to the function with a sample list of numbers and a threshold of 0.3 to test the result if the function returns True, indicating that there are numbers close to each other in the list.
