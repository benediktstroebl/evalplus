```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Initialize a set to keep track of the minimum and maximum elements from the list.
    numbers = set(numbers)
    min_val, max_val = min(numbers), max(numbers)
    
    # Initialize a boolean list to check the existence of pairs that are close to the threshold
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                close_pairs.append(i, j)
    
    # Check if there are any pairs that are close to each other
    if len(close_pairs) > 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
``` 

This solution checks the presence of elements in the list that are close to each other. It creates a set of unique elements in the list and then loops through the list to check for every pair if the difference between these elements is less than or equal to the specified threshold. This process returns a ** True, since if there are any elements in the list that are close to each other, the function returns True.
