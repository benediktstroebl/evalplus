Here's a self-contained Python function that checks for elements in a list that are closer than a given threshold. 

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.

    if any two elements in numbers that are closer than threshold:
        return True
    """
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False

This function uses a loop to iterate over the list of numbers and checks if any two adjacent elements are closer than the given threshold.  The result returns True if any of these conditions are met. 

The function is well-contained and can be easily understood as it uses a simple algorithm to solve the problem.
