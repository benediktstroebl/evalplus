Here's a self-contained Python function that checks if any two numbers in a given list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Type hint to ensure function accepts correct arguments
    numbers = [num for num in numbers] if isinstance(numbers, List)] else numbers = [num]
    # Check if any two elements in the list are closer than the threshold
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```

This function takes two parameters: `numbers`, which is a list of floating-point numbers, and `threshold`, which is a float value. The function uses a nested loops to iterate over pairs of elements in the list. If any two elements in the two elements are closer than the `threshold`, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

You can use this function by passing the desired list of numbers and threshold as arguments, and it will return `True` if there are any pairs of elements that are closer than the `threshold`.
