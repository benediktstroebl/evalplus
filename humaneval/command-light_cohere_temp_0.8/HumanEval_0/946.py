Here is a self-contained Python function that checks if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort list in ascending order
    numbers.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x:x)

    for i in range(len(numbers)-1):
        if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[i+1]) < threshold:
            return True

    return False
```

This function first sorts the input list in ascending order and then checks if the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements is less than the given threshold. The function returns True if any two elements in the list are closer than the threshold, and False otherwise.

You can use this function as follows:

```python
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
threshold = 0.5)

result = has_close_elements(numbers, 0.5)  # Returns True, because the two numbers are within the threshold
```

You can test the function with different lists and thresholds to check if it works as expected.
