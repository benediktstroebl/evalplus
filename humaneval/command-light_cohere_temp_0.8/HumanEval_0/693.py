Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you provided:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
   0.0),6 do not_close elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0], 0.3] since threshold=1.1)

   0> are  True, else False
    """
The function takes two parameters: a list of numbers and a threshold. It then checks if in the list of numbers, any two elements are closer than the given threshold. It then returns True if there are any such close elements, and False otherwise.
