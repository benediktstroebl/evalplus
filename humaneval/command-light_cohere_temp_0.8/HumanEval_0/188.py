Here's a self-contained Python script with a function named `has_close_elements` that checks if any two numbers in a given list are closer than a given threshold. 

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5); 0.6)
    worth less than5.0, 0.5.
    <= threshold
    results any for all numbers in the list.)
    """
    return any(x != y for x, y in zip(numbers)) <= threshold

This function takes in two inputs: a list of numbers and a threshold value. It returns a boolean value indicating if any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold. 

In essence, this function performs a set of comparisons to determine if there are any two numbers in the list that are close to each other, and returns a boolean value based on the result of those comparisons.
