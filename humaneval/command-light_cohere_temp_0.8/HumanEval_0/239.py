Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem of determining if any two numbers in a given list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List
import math

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Calculate the difference between the two elements
    min_distance = float("inf")
    max_distance = 0
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        current_element = numbers[i]
        next_element = numbers[i+1]
        # Calculate the difference between the two elements
        distance = math.abs(next_element - - current_element - threshold)
        # If the difference is greater than the minimum distance, set the minimum distance as the new maximum distance
        if distance > max_distance:
            max_distance = distance
        # If the difference is less than the maximum distance, set the difference as the new minimum distance
        else:
            min_distance = distance
    # Return true if min_distance is greater than max_distance, or if both min_distance and max_distance are equal
    return min_distance > max_distance

```
The function takes two arguments: `numbers`, which is a list of floating-point numbers, and `threshold`, which is a float that determines the minimum distance below which two numbers can be considered to be close to each other. The function iterates over the minimum and maximum distances, and updates the values as it goes through the list. The function returns true if the end elements of the list are equal, meaning that they are closer than the given threshold, or if the minimum distance is greater than the maximum distance.
