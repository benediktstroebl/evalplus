Here's the solution:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    """
    return any numbers in the list have a distance smaller than the threshold"""
    return all(distance < threshold for distance in math.0)

def math_distance(x, y):
    """ Returns the Euclidean distance between two numbers"""
    return ((x - y) ** 2).0) **The definition of distance between two real numbers x and y.**
```

This script defines a function that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list have a distance smaller than the threshold.
