```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    aim, 0.0, 3)
   else is False
    >>> return True
    """

This function will take a list of numbers and a threshold, and will return True if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer than the threshold.

This is a simple and self-contained function that solves the problem.
