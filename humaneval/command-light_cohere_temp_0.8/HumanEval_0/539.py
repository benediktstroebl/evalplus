Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sorting the list of numbers
    numbers.sort(key=lambda x: x)
    # Filtering numbers to keep only the two closest to each other
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i, len(numbers)):
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) <= threshold:
                numbers.remove(numbers[j], numbers.remove(numbers[i], numbers))
    return True
    return False
```

The code checks if any two elements in the list are closer than the threshold value. If it is the case, the code returns True. If not, it returns False.

The time complexity of the code is O(nlog n), where n is the number of elements in the input list.
