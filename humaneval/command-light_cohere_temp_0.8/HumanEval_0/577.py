Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of checking if any two numbers in a given list are closer than a given threshold:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Initialize a list of all pairs of numbers and their proximity
    all_pairs_index = [i for i, j in zip(numbers) for i, j in numbers)]
    all_pairs_distance = [sum(j - i for i, j in zip(numbers))]
    
    # Initialize the pair with the closest pair of numbers and the distance to them
    closest_pair, min_distance = (min(all_pairs_distance), float("inf"))
    pair = all_pairs_index[closest_pair]
    distance = all_pairs_distance[closest_pair]
    
    # Check if the distance is less than the threshold
    return distance < threshold

# Test the function with the example input
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6]

threshold = 0.2

result = has_close_elements(numbers, threshold)
print(result)
```

The function uses a technique called "pairwise neighbor comparison" to efficiently calculate the distance between all pairs of numbers in the list. It uses the concept of "k-way" nearest neighbor relationship, where any pair of numbers can be considered as a "neighbor" and the distance between them can be calculated as the sum of the absolute difference of their corresponding values. The function then initializes the list of all pairs of numbers and their proximity, which is calculated as the sum of the absolute difference between each pair of numbers. The function then initializes the closest pair of numbers and the distance to them, which is determined by finding the minimum of all the distances between pairs of numbers in the list. The function then checks if the distance is less than the threshold, which indicates that the two numbers are closer than the threshold. 
The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the condition is satisfied.
