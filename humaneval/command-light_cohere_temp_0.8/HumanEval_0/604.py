Here's a self-contained Python function that checks if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```

This function takes in two arguments: a list of numbers and a threshold. After checking the the each element in the list against every other, it returns True if there are any two elements that are closer than the given threshold, otherwise it returns False. 

This function is self-contained and does not use any external functions or modules. It is a way to be easily tested and is a complete implementation of the problem.
