```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Initialize a set to store the results of the closer-together function.
    closer_together = set()

    # Call the closer_together function and store the results in the set
    for n in numbers:
        if n < threshold:
            continue
        closer_together.add(n)

    # Return True if any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold
    return len(closer_together) > 0

# Example usage
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0, 0.0]

has_close_elements(numbers, 0.0)  # Output: True
```
This script defines a function called has_close_elements, which takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input. The function returns True if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer than the threshold. The function uses the set function to store the results of the closer_together function, which is called for each number in the list.
