Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you provided:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Initialize a set to store if elements are closer than the given threshold
    closer_than_threshold = set()

    # Loop through the list of numbers and check for each pair of numbers
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                closer_than_threshold.add((numbers numbers[i, j))

    # Return true if any pair of elements in the list are closer than the threshold
    return closer_than_threshold.is_disjoint()

```

This script uses a set to check if any two elements in the given list numbers are closer than the given threshold. It loops through two loops and adds the pair of elements to the set if they are within the threshold. The final value is returned is true if the set contains any elements.
