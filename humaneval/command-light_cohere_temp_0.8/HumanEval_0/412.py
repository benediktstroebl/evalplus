Here's a solution for the provided markdown code block:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5).3) has True> have_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
   8
   3.0(1.0-a0])

    True

    This function takes two parameters: a list of numbers and a threshold float. It returns a boolean value that indicates if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer to each other than the threshold. 

This function uses the threshold parameter to compare if any two numbers in the numbers list are closer to each other than the threshold value.
