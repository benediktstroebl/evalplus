Here's a self-contained Python function that checks if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold:
```python
import math

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return False

    # Calculate the absolute difference between two consecutive elements
    diff = math.abs(numbers[1] - numbers[0])

    # If the difference is less than the threshold, return True
    if diff < threshold:
        return True

    return False

# Test cases:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
result = has_close_elements(numbers, 0.0) # True

numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0]
result = has_close_elements(numbers, 0.0) # False

numbers = [1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0]
result = has_close_elements(numbers, 1e-1)  # True

This function works by first checking if the length of the list is less than 2. If it is, then it returns False, indicating that the list does not contain at least two elements. 

If the length is greater than or equal to 2, it calculates the absolute difference between the first and second element of the list. Then, it checks if this difference is less than the given threshold. 

Finally, it returns True if the condition is met, indicating that the list contains at least two elements that are closer than each other than the threshold, and False otherwise.
