```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.

This function accepts two arguments:
 - `numbers`: a list of numbers, where the elements are floating-point numbers.
- `threshold`: a float value, which represents the minimum distance between any two numbers in the `numbers` list, below which they will be considered as close to each other.

This function checks if the `numbers` list has at least two elements. If it does, it checks if the two first elements are closer than the `threshold` value. If they are, it checks if the second element is also closer to the first element than the `threshold`.
