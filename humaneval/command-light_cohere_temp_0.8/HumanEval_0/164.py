Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of determining if any two numbers in a given list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5); 0.8) # This important() and 0.50000
    have equal values and are numbers, so using the Pythonic built-in function **min()** we can get the min of two numbers and compare it with our threshold. If the min of the two numbers is less than the threshold, then the function returns **True**, and if the threshold is not reached, then the function returns **False**.
