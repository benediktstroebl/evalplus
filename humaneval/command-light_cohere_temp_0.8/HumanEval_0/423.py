Here's a self-contained Python function that checks if any two elements in the list are closer than a given threshold:
```python
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[i] - numbers[i + 1] <= threshold:
            return True
    return False
```
This function loops through the list and checks if the difference between the two numbers is less than the threshold. It returns True if any pair of numbers satisfy this condition, and False otherwise.
