```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5); 0.3)
   ly threshold of 0.0
   3.15 and return True
    green elements are < threshold and are >= threshold.

    """
    return any of the following:
    if numbers[0] - numbers[1] <= threshold:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
The code uses a threshold to determine if two numbers are close enough to each other. This is done by comparing the difference between the two numbers and returning true if it's less than or equal to the threshold. The function then returns True if the difference between the numbers is within the threshold, and False otherwise.
