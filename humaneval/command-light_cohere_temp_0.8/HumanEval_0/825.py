Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    They need to be within 1e-6 * threshold to be considered close enough.
    """

    values are sorted in ascending order.
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return False
    return any(x != y for x, y in zip(numbers[1:], numbers[0:])) and any(x != numbers[0]) and numbers[1] <= threshold

# There is a bug in the function

# The correct version of the function uses the lower bound of values in the range, which is 1e-6.

# The bug is in the line
> return any(x != y) and any(x != numbers[0]) and numbers[1] <= threshold

This function uses the 'any' function with a generator expression and compares the values with the 'threshold' to check if they are close enough.
