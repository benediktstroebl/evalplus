Here's the solution:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    """
    # Sort the list of numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort()
    important in the descending order
    # Find the first two elements in the sorted list
    a = numbers[0]
    b = numbers[1]
    # Check if the difference between the two elements is smaller than the threshold
    if abs(a - b) < threshold:
        return True
    return False
```
This code defines a function that checks if two elements in a list are closer to each other than a given threshold. It achieves this by first sorting the list of numbers in ascending order and then comparing the first two elements of the sorted list. The code then compares these two elements and checks if their absolute difference is smaller than the given threshold.
