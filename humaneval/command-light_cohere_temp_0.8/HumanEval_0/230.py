Here's the solution:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort(key=lambda x: (x<threshold and x<numbers[-1]))
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```

This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list has any two elements that are closer than each other than the threshold. The function first sorts the sort the list, then uses a loop to compare each element with all the remaining elements in the list. The function then checks if the element is less than the current maximum element in the list, and if it is also less than the last element in the list, it returns True. If the loop completes without finding a pair that is closer than the threshold, the function returns False.
