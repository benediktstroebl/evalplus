Here is a self-contained Python function that checks if any two elements in the list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[i] - numbers[i + 1] < threshold:
            return True
    return False
```
This function iterates through the list of numbers, and checks if the difference between the two consecutive elements is smaller than the given threshold. It returns True if any pair of numbers satisfies the condition, otherwise it returns False.
