Here's a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem of checking if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List
import math

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the input list
    numbers.sort(key=lambda num: math.floor(num), minimum(num), reverse=True))
    # Initialize two lists to store whether two elements are closer than the threshold or not
    first_list = []
    second_list = []
    for num1, num2 in zip(numbers, numbers):
        distance = math.sqrt((num1 -minimum((num2-num1)**2))
        if distance < threshold:
            first_list.append(True)
        second_list.append(True)
   
    return any(first_list) and any(second_list))
```

This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold. The function first sorts the list and creates two lists to store whether two elements are closer than the threshold or not. Then, the function iterates through the lists and returns True if there are any elements in both lists. The function uses a mathematical method to calculate the distance between two numbers and checks if the distance is less than the threshold.

Note: Please remember to install the necessary typing and math libraries.
