```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Check if two consecutive elements in the list are closer than the threshold
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        if numbers[i] - numbers[i - 1] < threshold:
            return True
    return False
```
This Python function, `has_close_elements`, is defined to determine if any two consecutive elements in a given list are closer than a specified threshold. The function takes in two arguments: a list of numbers and a threshold value. The function iterates through index 1 to the length of the list and checks if the current element is closer to the previous element than the given threshold. The function returns `True` if any of these conditions are met, and `False` otherwise.
