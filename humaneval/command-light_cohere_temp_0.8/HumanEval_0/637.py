```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    """
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This code implements a function called has_close_elements that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two elements in the list are closer than the threshold. The function uses a nested for loops to iterate over the list of numbers and checks if the difference between each pair of numbers is less than or equal to the given threshold. It returns True if any of these conditions are met, indicating that the list contains elements that are close to each other.
