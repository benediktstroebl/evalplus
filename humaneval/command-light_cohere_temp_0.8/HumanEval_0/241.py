```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.1)
    records close
    simple case, so we can just check the first and last element in the list, and if they are closer than the given threshold, we return True. 
    """
     numbers.append(numbers[0])
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[i] < numbers[i+1]:
            return True
    return False
```
This solution uses a sliding window approach to efficiently check if any two consecutive elements in the list are closer than the given threshold.  The function is simple and can be easily understood by anyone reading the code.
