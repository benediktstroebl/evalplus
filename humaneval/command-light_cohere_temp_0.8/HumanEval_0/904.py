Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of checking if any two numbers in a list are closer to each other than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    class0
    one 
    """ The above lines have been modified to follow the following standards: 
    - It now uses List[float] instead of a list of strings to store the numbers.
    - It is a standard Python list that contains only floating-point numbers.
    - The function now accepts two parameters: a list of numbers and a threshold.
    that is a given float value. This allows for flexibility when calling the function with different types of inputs.
