```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Initialize a set to keep track of numbers that are less than the given threshold.
    set = set()  # Create a set to keep track of the numbers that are less than the given threshold.
    for number in numbers:
        if number < threshold:
            set.add(number)
    # If any number from the set is found within numbers, and it is less than the threshold, then return True.
    return set.contains(threshold)
if number == threshold:
        return False
    return True

# Test the function
numbers = [1.0, 2.8, 3.8, 4.0, 5.8]
threshold = 0.3
result = has_close_elements(numbers, threshold)
```
The code checks if any two numbers from the list are closer than the given threshold. It creates a set of numbers and adds numbers to it that are less than the given threshold. It checks if the number is equal to the threshold, then it returns False. If no such set number is equal to the threshold, then it returns True.
