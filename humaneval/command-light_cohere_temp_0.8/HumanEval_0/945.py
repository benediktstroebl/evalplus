```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # make sure numbers is a list of floats
    if not isinstance(numbers, List):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list of numbers")
    # make sure numbers is not empty
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        return False
    # sort numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort()
    numbers
    max_num = max(numbers)
    min_num = min(numbers)
    # check if any two consecutive elements in numbers are less than or equal to each other
    # threshold is defined as the minimum of two consecutive elements
    if max_num >= threshold and min_num >= threshold:
        return True
    # return False
    return False
```
This code defines a function called `has_close_elements` that checks if any two consecutive elements in a given list of numbers are less than or equal to a given threshold. The function returns `True` if any such elements satisfy this condition and `False` otherwise.
