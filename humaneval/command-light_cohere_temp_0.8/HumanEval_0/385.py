```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    Return True if two elements in the list are closer than threshold, otherwise False
    Test cases:
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.01)
    imagine
    CASES:
        1.  and 2.0 are in this, since the two numbers are less than threshold, so function will return False.
        3.  and 0.3 are in, since the two numbers are equal to threshold, so function will return True
    """
    return any(num1 <= num2 + threshold for num1, num2 in numbers)

In this code, the has_close_elements function takes in a List[float] called numbers and a threshold float called threshold. The function then uses the Python's built-in any function to check if any two elements in the list are closer than the given threshold.
