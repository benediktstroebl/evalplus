Here's the solution to the markdown code block problem:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Remove duplicates and sort the list
    numbers = list(set(numbers))
    numbers.sort()
   
    smallest_num = min(numbers, default=float('-inf')))
    for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]):
        if abs(x - y) < threshold:
            return True
    return False
```

This function accepts a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than each other than the given threshold. The function first removes duplicates from the list of numbers and sorts it. Then, it iterates through pairs of numbers in the sorted list and checks if the absolute difference between the two numbers is less than the given threshold.
