Here is a Python script that defines a function to check if any two numbers in a given list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
   .2.0], 3.3)
    tale
    germ:1.5
    #0)
    # If the two values are considered closer, it returns true, otherwise false.
 is a number in list.

# if any two numbers are close to each other, return true
# if not, return false
def main():
    numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0]
    first = has_close_elements(numbers, 0.0)
```

This script provides a solution to the problem. It uses the "has_close_elements" function to check if any two numbers in a given list are closer than a given threshold. The function returns true if the two values are considered close and false if not.

The function works by creating a list of numbers and a threshold. The function then iterates over the list, and checks if any two numbers are closer than the threshold. The function returns true if the two values are considered close, and false if not.
