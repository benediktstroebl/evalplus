Here's the solution to the problem you described:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold
    """
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[i] - numbers[i + 1] <= threshold:
            return True
    return False
```
This function checks if any two consecutive elements in the list are closer to each other than the given threshold. It starts from the partnership and returns True if any pair is within the threshold, indicating an unclosed structure. If no such is identified, it returns False.
