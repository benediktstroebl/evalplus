```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This code implements a function called `has_close_elements` that takes in two arguments: a list of numbers (`numbers`) and a threshold value (`threshold`). The function aims to determine if any two consecutive elements in the input list are closer than each other than the given threshold. 

The function uses a nested loop to compare each element in the list with the next element. It checks if the particular element is within a certain threshold of difference from the next element. 

Finally, it returns `True` if any pair of elements is found to be closer than the threshold.
