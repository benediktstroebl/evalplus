Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # list of numbers that need to be checked
    # then a threshold to check against the current number
    # compare the current number with every other number in the list
    # if they are closer than the threshold, return true
    # else return false
    # return true 
    for i in numbers:
        if i < threshold or numbers[i] < threshold and i - numbers < threshold:
            return True
    return False
```

This function will return True if any two elements in the numbers list are closer than the threshold, otherwise it will return False.
