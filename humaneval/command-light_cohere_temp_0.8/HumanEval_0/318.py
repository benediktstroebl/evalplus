Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem:

```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    region."""
    than the a bool that returns True if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer to each other than the threshold.
