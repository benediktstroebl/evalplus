Here's the solution for the problem you provided:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in the list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than the threshold.
    """
    return any of the following conditions are true: 
    1. All elements are the numbers in the list are distinct. 
    2. Two elements numbers numbers are values in the list have the same value. 
    3. There is name of numbers in the list have two different values that are less than the threshold. 
4. return numbers in the list have a greater value than the threshold. 

The function uses the Python list function to compare the numbers in the list. It returns True if the list has two numbers with the same value and greater value than the threshold.
