Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem of checking if any two numbers in the list are closer than a given threshold:
```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Initialize a dictionary to store the results of comparison
    comp_dict = {}

    # Loop through the list of numbers
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            # Calculate the difference between the two numbers
            diff = numbers[i] - numbers[j]
            # If the difference is less than the threshold, check if it's also in the dictionary
            if diff in comp_dict:
                # If it's in the dictionary, return true
                return True
            comp_dict[diff] = numbers[i]
            comp_dict[numbers[i]] = numbers[j]
    return False
```

This code defines a function called `has_close_elements` that takes two parameters: a list of numbers and a threshold value. The function loops through the the list and compares each pair of adjacent elements. It calculates the difference between each element and the next one, and stores the results in a dictionary. After looping through whole list, the function returns the value of `comp_dict` as `True` if any number in the list is found to be the same as any other number in the list, but less than the threshold, and returns `False` otherwise.
