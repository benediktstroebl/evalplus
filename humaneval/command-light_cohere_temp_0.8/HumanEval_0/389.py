```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # using two lists to hold close and far elements
    close_elements = []
    far_elements = []
    
    # loop through list and append elements that are closer than the threshold to the close_elements list
    for num in numbers:
        if num <= threshold:
            close_elements.append(num)
    
    # loop through the list and append elements that are farther than the threshold to the far_elements list
    for num in numbers:
        if num > threshold:
            far_elements.append(num)
    
    # check if there is at least one pair of close elements that are less than the second one in the list of elements
    if close_elements and far_elements:
        return True
    
    # check if there are no close or far elements
    return False
```

The above function has a self-contained loop that uses the two lists concept to separate elements that are close and far from the threshold value. The function finally returns the of the fact that the list of numbers either contains at least one pair of close elements that are less than the second one, or that there are no close or far elements, and so it returns false.
