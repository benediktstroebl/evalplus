```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the input list of numbers in ascending order.
    numbers.sort_as()
   GUI: [1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 3.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 1.3, 0.1]
   zeds in order.
    # Iterate through the A.A.B.B the first2 for afirst number of  two numbers that are less than the given threshold.
    that are close to each other.
    # Initialize the and return a boolean value
    return any(numbers <= threshold)
``` 
The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), as the loop runs up to the first element in the sorted list, and each element is accessed approximately constant time.
