Here's a solution to the problem using Python:

```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    """
    return any of the numbers in the list are closer than the threshold, return True
    """
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort()

    # Return the least value of the list is the number to check if it is greater than the second number.
    while numbers[1] < numbers[0]:
        numbers[0], numbers[1] = numbers[1], numbers[0]
    # If two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold, return True
    return numbers[0] <= threshold
```
This code implements a function that checks whether two elements in a list are close to each other, within a given threshold. It uses the numbers sort function to sort the list, and then compares the first and second elements. If the first element is greater than the second, and if they are closer than the given threshold, it returns True, indicating that there is a close pair. 
This approach provides a quick and efficient way to check for close pairs in a list of numbers.
