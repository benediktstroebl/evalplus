Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that checks for elements that are close to each other in a list of numbers:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```

This function compares all pairs of numbers in the list to see if the absolute difference between them is less than or equal to the threshold. It returns True if any two elements are closer than the threshold, otherwise, it returns False.
