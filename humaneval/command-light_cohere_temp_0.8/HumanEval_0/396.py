Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of determining if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold:
```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold.

This function uses a nested loop to iterate over the list of numbers and checks if the difference between any two numbers is less than the threshold. It returns True if any pair of numbers is closer than the threshold.
