Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you provided:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # sort the list
    numbers.sort(key=lambda x: x)
    # check if the two most close elements are less than the threshold
    if numbers[-1] + numbers[-2] < threshold:
        return True
    # return that list is empty
    return False

test_cases = [
    has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 5.0], 2.0, 2.0, 4.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.8, 3.0], 0.3)
0.0, 1.0, 0.8, 0.8, 0.0, 0.0], 0.9
# returns: True, it has close elements
test_cases[0]
```
This Python script defines a function called `has_close_elements` that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list has any two elements closer than the threshold. The function sorts the list and then checks if the two most close elements are less than the threshold. The function then returns True, indicating that the list has close elements.
