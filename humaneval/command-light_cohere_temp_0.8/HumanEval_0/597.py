```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] < threshold:
                return True
    return False

# Test cases
numbers = [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 0.1, 8.8, 9.0, 10]

result = has_close_elements(numbers, 0.2)
print(result)

This script defines a function called `has_close_elements` that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input. It then loops through the pair of elements in the list, comparing if the difference between the two elements is less than the threshold. It returns True if any two elements are closer than the threshold, and returns False otherwise. The test cases demonstrate the application of the function, passing in a list of numbers and a threshold, and the function returns True if any two elements are closer than the threshold.
