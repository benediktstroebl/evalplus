Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of checking if any two numbers in a given list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.

    # Sort list ascending
   
    numbers = sorted(numbers, key=lambda x: x)
    
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return False
    
    min_num = float("inf")
    max_num = float(-"inf")
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):
            distance = numbers[j] - numbers[i]
            if distance < threshold:
                if min_num > distance:
                    min_num = distance
                elif max_num < distance:
                    max_num = distance
        
        if max_num < min_num:
            return True
    
    return False
```

This code implements a function that determines whether two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold. It efficiently compares the  numbers in the list using the sorted() function and the sorted ascending comparison of numbers, which helps to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. The code also uses two nested loops to calculate the Euclidean distance between each pair of numbers and to check if the distance is less than the given threshold.
