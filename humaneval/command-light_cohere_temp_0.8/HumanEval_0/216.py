Here is a self-contained Python function that checks whether any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    """
    for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]):
        if math.abs(x - x -y) <= threshold:
            return True
    return False
```
This function has a dictionary of the parameters and their type, and the return statement, which helps with type hint and better code readability and maintainability.
