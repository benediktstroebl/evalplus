```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold:
                return True
    return False
``` 
This code defines a function that checks if any two consecutive elements in a list are closer than a given threshold. It does this check using two nested loops, where the first loop iterates over the list except the last element, and the second loop iterates over the elements of the list except the one that's just before. 

This function returns True if any two elements are closer than the given threshold, and False otherwise.
