```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False

# Example usage:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 5.0, 2.0, 0.0]
numbers = [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
has_close_elements(numbers, 0.0)
``` 
This function takes two arguments: `numbers`, which is a list of numbers, and `threshold`, which is a float representing the minimum difference between two numbers that are considered close. The function then iterates through the length of the numbers list, starting from index 0. For each pair of adjacent numbers, it then checks if the difference between those numbers is less than or equal to the `threshold`. If the condition is met, the function returns `True`, indicating that there are elements in the list that are close enough to each other.
