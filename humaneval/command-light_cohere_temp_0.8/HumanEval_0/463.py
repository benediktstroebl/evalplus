Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you described: 

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort(key=lambda x: (x<threshold or x>threshold))
    # Initialize two objects to store the current and next numbers
    cur_num = 0
    next_num = numbers[0]
    has_close = False
    # Iterate through the list of numbers
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        # Check if the current number is less than the next number
        if num < next_num:
            cur_num = num
            next_num = numbers[0]
            has_close = True
        # Check if the current number is greater than the next number
        elif num > next_num:
            cur_num = num
            next_num = numbers[0]
            has_close = True
    # Return true if the condition is met
    return has_close
```

This script defines a function that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input. It sorts the numbers and then checks if any two consecutive numbers are closer than the given threshold. 

Note that the function returns `True` if any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold, otherwise it returns `False`.
