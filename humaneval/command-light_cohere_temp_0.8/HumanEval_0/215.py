Here is a self-contained Python function that checks if any two elements in the list are closer than the threshold:

```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.0) is0.10).3) is True_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)"""True then0
   0, threshold=0.5) returns False."""
    Return True if any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold. Return False otherwise.

This function uses the " closeness of two numbers" which is the absolute value of the difference between two numbers divided by the square of the smaller number. It returns True if the equal or less than the threshold, and False otherwise.
