```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
   
        Only under the overall, any list of numbers is valid.
``` 
This script defines a function `has_close_elements` that checks whether any two numbers in the list are closer than each other than a given threshold. It returns `True` if any of the conditions are met, and `False` otherwise. The function takes a input as a list of numbers and a threshold, and returns `True` if any two elements in the list are closer than the threshold, and returns `False` otherwise.
