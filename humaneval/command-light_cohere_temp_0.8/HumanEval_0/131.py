Here's the answer to the prompt:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
    >>> return any close_element([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.1) < threshold > 0.0
   0) is a whole element.
    """
    sure that there are at least two elements that are close, return true."""
 return any(x <= y for x,y in zip(numbers,numbers))
```
