Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x:math.sqrt(x**2))
    # Initialize a boolean variable
    has_close = False
    # Iterate through the list
    for i in range(len(numbers)-1):
        for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):
            if math.sqrt(numbers[i]**2) - threshold <= math.sqrt(numbers[j]**2):
                has_close = True
                break
    return has_close

# Test the function
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
has_close_elements(numbers, 0.0.5)
```

This code defines a function called `has_close_elements` that takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean value that indicates whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold. The function uses the sort the list of numbers and then iterates through the list, checking if the distance between each pair of numbers is less than the given threshold. The function returns `True` if any of the conditions are met, indicating that there are no two numbers in the list that are closer than each other than the given threshold.
