Here's a Python script that provides a self-contained function to solve the problem:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.4)
    IF ANY two, YES THEN
    return True
    ELSE
        return False
    """

This function takes two arguments: `numbers`, which is the input list of numbers to check, and `threshold`, which is the threshold value to determine if two numbers are close. The function then checks if any two numbers in the list are closer than each other than `threshold`, and returns `True` if they are, and `False` otherwise.
