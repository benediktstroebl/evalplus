Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you described and passes the test you provided:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.2)  #.0)
    deed?marks. For each two2 old number
    standard mathematical rule.
