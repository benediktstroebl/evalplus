Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of checking if any two numbers in a given list are closer to each other than a given threshold:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # sort numbers to make a minimum distance comparison easier
    numbers.sort()
    _ minimum_threshold = threshold
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= minimum_threshold:
                return True
    return False

# test
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 5.0]
threshold = 0.5
has_close_elements(numbers, threshold=0.5) # values are close, but the difference between them is less than our threshold

This function returns True if the input list has any elements that are closer than the given threshold. It does not matter if the input list is empty. The function is also written in a self-contained manner and does not require any additional arguments.
