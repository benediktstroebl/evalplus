Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of checking if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) False)
   My_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.8) will True)
    support cases"""

The function takes two input arguments: a list of numbers and a threshold. It returns a boolean value that indicates whether any two elements in the list are closer than the threshold. The function uses the mathematical concept of the Euclidean distance between two points to calculate if the two elements are close enough.
