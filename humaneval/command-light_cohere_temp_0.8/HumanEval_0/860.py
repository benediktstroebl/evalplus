Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Initialize a set to hold the results
    results = set()

    # Loop through the list of numbers
    for num1 in numbers:
        for num2 in numbers:
            # If two numbers are closer than the threshold, add them to the set
            if abs(num1 - num2) <= threshold:
                results.add (num1, num2)

    # Check if there are any elements in the set
    return bool(results)

# Example usage:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0]
threshold = 0.2)
has_close_elements(numbers, 0.2)  # Returns True

This Python code defines a function called has_close_elements that checks whether any two elements in a list of numbers are closer than a given threshold. It achieves this by using a set to store the results and iterating through the list of numbers. The code then compares each pair of numbers in the list, if the absolute difference of one is less than or equal to the threshold, it adds the two numbers to the set.
