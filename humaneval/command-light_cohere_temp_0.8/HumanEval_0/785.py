```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    They are not close enough."""
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] < threshold:
                return False
    return True
```
This code evaluates two nested loops to compare every element in the `numbers` list with every other. It then returns `False` if any two numbers are closer than the `threshold`, and returns `True` otherwise. This implementation is is a simple and straightforward way to solve the problem.
