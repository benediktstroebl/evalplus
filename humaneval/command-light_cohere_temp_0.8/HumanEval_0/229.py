```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[i] - numbers[i + 1] < threshold:
            return True
    return False
```
This Python code defines a function named has_close_elements that checks whether any two consecutive elements in a given list are closer than a user-specified threshold. The function takes two arguments: a list of numbers (represented as a List[float]) and a threshold value as floats. 

It uses a loop to iterate through the list of numbers, comparing each pair of consecutive elements. If it finds any pair of elements that are within the threshold, it immediately returns True, indicating that there are close elements in the list.

Finally, if no such pair meets this condition within the loop, the function returns False, indicating that no close elements are found in the list.

This function can be useful for checking if lists contain any consecutive elements that are very close to each other, which can be useful in various scenarios, such as data analysis or sorting.
