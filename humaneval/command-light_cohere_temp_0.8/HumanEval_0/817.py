```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than the given threshold.
    """
    Returns a has a key here which is the threshold, which is then compared against the minimum distance between any two numbers in the list.
    has_close_elements takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the given threshold.

The solution utilizes the Trie data structure, which is a very efficient data structure that is used to solve problems like this. It is a way to do a lookup in constant time and has a fixed amount of space, which makes it very efficient.
