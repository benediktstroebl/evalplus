```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # initialize a counter for adjacent elements
    count = 0
    
    # check if two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                count += 1
    
    # return true if any two elements are closer than the threshold
    return count > 1

# pass the function to test
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0, 6, 7, 8, 9]

```
This Python script defines a function called has_close_elements that checks whether a given list of numbers contains any two elements closer than a specified threshold. The function uses a `Count` variable to keep track of the number of consecutive elements in the list that are within the threshold range. The script then iterates over the list, comparing each pair of adjacent elements with those that come after them. If any such pair is within the threshold, the count is incremented. Finally, the function returns True if the count is greater than 1, indicating that there are two elements in the list that are within the threshold range. The function is then tested using a list of numbers and a threshold value, and the result is printed to the console.
