Here is a self-contained Python function that checks if any two elements in the list are closer than the given threshold:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in numbers:
        for j in numbers:
            if math.abs(i - threshold) <= math.abs(j): threshold):
                return True
    return False
```

This function uses a loop to iterate through every pair of elements in the list, and checks if the absolute values of each pair are less than or equal to the given threshold. It returns True if it condition is met, indicating that the elements are close to each other.

This function can be easily incorporated into a markdown code block, and the result is self-contained within the code. You can use this same testing by running the code in the terminal or any other environment that supports executing Python scripts.
