Here's the solution:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold
    """
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```

This function iterates through the list of numbers and checks if there are any two numbers that are closer than the given threshold. It returns True if any such particular pair of numbers meets this condition. The function uses the specific comparison operator - == and threshold comparison - >. The two variables are compared to the built-in function List[float] to iterate through the list of numbers and perform the comparison.
