Here's a self-contained Python script with a function that checks if any two numbers in a list are closer to each other than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers)-1):
        for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This function takes two arguments: numbers, which is a list of float numbers, and threshold, which is a float value. The function loops through the two pointers i and j to compare each pair of numbers in the list. It checks if the numbers[i] and numbers[j] are closer to each other than the threshold. If they are, the function returns True, indicating that there are close numbers in the list. If not, it returns False.
