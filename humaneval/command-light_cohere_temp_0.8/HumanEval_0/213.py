Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you described:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort(key=lambda x: x)

    # Initialize two boolean lists to track closes and far numbers
    closes = [False] * 2
    far = [False] * 2

    # Initialize a counter for the first number
    count = 0

    # Iterate over the list
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        # Calculate the difference between the current number and the number before
        x = numbers[i]
        previous = numbers[i-1] if i > 0 else float('inf')
        difference = x - previous
        if difference < 0:
            difference = -difference

        # If the difference is less than the threshold
        if difference <= threshold:
            closes[count] = True
            count += 1
        else:
            far[count] = True
            count += 1

    # Check if all the closes are correct
    if all(closes):
        return True

    # Check if any far numbers are correct
    return all(far)
```

This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold.  It checks for closes and far pairs, initializing the closes and far lists, iterating over the list of numbers, and comparing each number to the previous one. It calculates the difference between each number and the previous one, and if the difference is less than or equal to the threshold, it sets the closes list value for the current number's index to True and increments the counter for the first number. If the difference is greater than the threshold, it sets the far list value for the current number's index to True and increments the counter for the first number.  It also checks if all the closes are correct by checking if all the closes are True, and if all the far numbers are correct, it returns True.
