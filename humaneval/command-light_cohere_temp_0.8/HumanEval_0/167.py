Here is a self-contained Python function that checks if any two numbers in a given list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) or biomedical,
    is False, since all the values in the list are not equal or closer than each other.
    }
```
The function returns **True** if any two elements in the list are less than the threshold, and **False** otherwise.
