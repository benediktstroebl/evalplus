```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.

    # Sort list of numbers
    # Reversed order of sorting means that greater numbers are now smaller and less number are now greater
    # that helps to compare the numbers correctly.

    numbers.sort()
   
 critical step to be able to find the correct relationship between numbers.

    # check if there are two numbers that are close enough to each other to given threshold

    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] + numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False

# Test the function

    if has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 0.8], 0.1): False):
    false
```
The function has been improved by sorting the list of numbers. This is an important step in the algorithm to correctly identify if there are any two numbers close enough to each other within the given threshold.
