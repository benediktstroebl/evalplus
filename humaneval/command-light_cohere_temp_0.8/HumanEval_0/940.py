Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you provided:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
   aya)
   0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.8, 4.8, 5.8, 6.6, 5.0, 1.5), 0.3]
    information list the Regions are in the list and their values are less than the threshold.
    return is_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 0.5], 0.1])

is_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 0.8, 4.0, 5], 0.3])): 
return True)

This code defines a function has_close_elements that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean value indicating whether any two elements in the list are closer than the threshold.
