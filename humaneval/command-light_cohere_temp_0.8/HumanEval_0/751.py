```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input, then loops through the list, comparing each element with the remaining elements and checking if the absolute difference is less than or equal to the given threshold. This will return True if any two elements are closer to each other than the threshold.
