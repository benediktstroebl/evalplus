```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Initialize counter and max values
    counter = 0
    max_val = -float('inf')

    # Loop through list of numbers
    for num in numbers:
        # Calculate difference between this number and the last
        current_num = num - numbers[-1]
        # If the absolute difference is less than the threshold
        if current_num < threshold:
            counter += 1
        # Update the maximum value if needed
        if current_num > max_val:
            max_val = current_num

    # Return the counter value
    return counter > 1
``` 

This code defines a function called `has_close_elements` that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input. It then uses a counter and the maximum value of a difference between numbers to determine if any two consecutive numbers are closer than the threshold. The function returns `True` if the number of pairs that satisfy this condition is greater than one.
