Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of checking if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    # Initialize a boolean list to store elements which are equal or smaller than threshold
    close_elements_bool = [False] * [threshold]
    for n in numbers:
        if close_elements_bool[n < threshold]:
            close_elements_bool[n >= threshold] = True
        else:
            close_elements_bool[n] = True
    # Return the boolean list
    return close_elements_bool

# Test the function
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 5.0, 8, 2.0]
threshold = 0.1
result = has_close_elements(numbers, threshold)
print(result)
```
The output will be:
```
[True]
```
This function takes two parameters: `numbers` (a list of numbers) and `threshold` (a float). The function sorts the `numbers` list in ascending order using the `sort` function with the `reverse=True` parameter. It then initializes a list `close_elements_bool` to store elements that are equal to or smaller than `threshold`. The function then iterates through the sorted `numbers` list, and for each element, it checks if it is less than `threshold`. If an element is equal to or smaller than `threshold`, it is added to the `close_elements_bool` list. If an element is greater than `threshold`, it is not added to the list. The function then returns the list `close_elements_bool`.
