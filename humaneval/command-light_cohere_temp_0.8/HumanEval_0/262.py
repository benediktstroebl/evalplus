```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Initialize two lists to hold first and second elements of a pair
    first_elements = [n for n in numbers]

    second_elements = [n for n in reversed(numbers)]

    # Initialize two lists to hold elements to compare for each pair
    close_elements_list = []

    # Check for pairs with elements less than or equal to the threshold
    for first, second in zip(first_elements, second_elements):
        if first <= threshold or second <= threshold:
            close_elements_list.append((first, second))

    # Sort the close_elements_list
    close_elements_list.sort()

    then order of close_elements_list

    return any(close_elements_list)
```
The code uses a technique called pairwise zip to create pairs of elements from the input lists in parallel. The code then sorts the pair and compares it to a threshold to determine if it is within the threshold or not.
