Here's a self-contained Python function that checks if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # initialize two lists to store the elements that are within the threshold and the ones that are not
    near_elements = [0]
    close_numbers = [0]

    # loop through all the elements in the numbers list
    for num in numbers:
        # check if the current number is within the threshold
        if num <= threshold:
            near_elements.append(num)
        close_numbers.append(threshold)

    # check if there is any two numbers that are close enough to each other
    threshold
    # return the boolean flag
    return near_elements == close_numbers
```
This function checks if any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold. It uses two separate lists, near_elements and close_numbers, to store the numbers that are within the threshold and the ones that are not. The function then returns True if the two lists are equal, meaning that there were two numbers close enough to the given threshold.
