```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
   0, 0.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3)
   0) <= threshold"""

This code implements a function **`has_close_elements`** that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input. It uses the **`List`** and **`float`** data types to define the input variables **`numbers`** and **`threshold`**. and then uses a conditional statement to check if any two numbers in the list are closer than each other than the threshold.

The code returns a boolean value that indicates whether any two numbers in the list are closer than each other.
