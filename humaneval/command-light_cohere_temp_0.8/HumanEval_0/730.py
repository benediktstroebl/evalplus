Here's the self-contained Python script with the function `has_close_elements` that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    Return: True if any two elements are closer than the threshold, otherwise False
    """
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This code evaluates whether any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold. It uses two nested loops to compare each pair of elements and returns True if any of these conditions is met. The function successfully solves the main problem of checking if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold.
