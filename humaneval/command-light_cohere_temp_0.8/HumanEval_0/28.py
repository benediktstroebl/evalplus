```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    Return True if any two distinct elements are closer than the threshold, False otherwise. """
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This function uses a nested loop and the absolute value difference to check if any two distinct elements in the list are closer than the given threshold. The function returns True if any two numbers satisfy this condition, and False otherwise.

This solution uses the List[float] data type to store a list of floating-point numbers, and the threshold as a float value. It demonstrates a approach to solve the problem of identifying pairs of elements that are closer than a given threshold in a list of numbers.

The given code is well-contained and demonstrates a clear understanding of the problem and solution, as well as the usage of the typing and List[float] data types.
