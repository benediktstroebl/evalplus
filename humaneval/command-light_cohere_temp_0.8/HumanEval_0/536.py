Here is a Python function that checks if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list in ascending order
    numbers.sort()

    return any two elements in numbers are closer than the threshold
```

This function takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two elements in the list are closer than the threshold. 

You can test this function by passing in test data.
