Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem of checking if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    class0
    it
   )? areas the following numbers in the list, and if the second number is smaller than the first, we have a true case.

    Returns: True if any of the conditions are true, otherwise False.

Test cases:
| | Test case 1: [1.0, 2.0, 0.0, 3.0] |threshold?Mate.
| | Test case 2: [1.0, 0.0, 2.0, 3] |] is true.
| | Test case 3: [1.0, 0.0, 3.0, 0.0, 0.0] |] is false.
| | Test case 4: [1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 3] |] is false.
| | Test case 5: [1.0, 2.0, 3] |] is true.
| | Test case 6: [0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 2] |] is false.
