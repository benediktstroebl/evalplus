Here is a self-contained Python function that checks if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5),5- information None pair that is closer than threshold.
    """
    return any(numbers) in numbers <= threshold or any(numbers) in numbers >= threshold
    """

This function uses the `min` function with the `threshold` value to check if any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold. It returns `True` if any of the numbers in the list are less than or equal to the threshold, and returns `False` otherwise.
