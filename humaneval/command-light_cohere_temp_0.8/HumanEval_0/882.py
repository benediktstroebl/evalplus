Here is a Python function that checks if any two elements in a given list are closer than a certain threshold:

```python
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    numbers = sorted(numbers)
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```

This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether there are any two numbers in the list that are closer than the threshold. 

This function uses a sorting algorithm to sort the numbers in ascending order, and then uses a nested loop to check if any two adjacent numbers are closer than the threshold. 

The function returns `True` if there are any such pairs of numbers, and `False` otherwise. 
This function is a good example of a self-contained Python function that solves a specific problem.
