Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of checking if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    """
    return any(abs(num1 - num2) <= threshold for num1, num2 in zip(numbers))
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold.

The function uses the **any()** function, which returns **True** if at least one element returns **True**. 
The function then uses the **abs()** function to get the absolute value of each pair of numbers and checks if the absolute values are less than or equal to the threshold.

This function is a self-contained solution that can be used to solve the problem in a markdown code block.
