Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function that checks if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This function takes two arguments: `numbers`, which is the list of numbers we want to check, and `threshold`, which is the minimum distance between any two elements. 

This function uses a nested loop to compare each pair of elements in the list and returns `True` if any two elements are closer than the given threshold.
