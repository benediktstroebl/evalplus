Here's a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the input list of numbers
    numbers.sort(key=lambda x:x, reverse=True)
    # Compare two adjacent elements and check their distance is less than the threshold
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        current_element = numbers[i]
        next_element = numbers[i-1]
        if current_element - next_element <= threshold:
            return True
    return False
```
The function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than each other than the threshold.

You can test this function by passing different lists of numbers and threshold values. The function will then correctly identify if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer than each other than the threshold.
