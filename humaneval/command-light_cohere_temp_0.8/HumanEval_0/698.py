```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[i] - numbers[i + 1] <= threshold:
            return True
    return False
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether there are any two numbers in the list that are closer than the threshold. It uses a range-based loop to iterate over the list of numbers, and checks if the current number is less than the next number by the given threshold. If it is, the function returns True, indicating that there are close elements in the list that are less than the threshold.
