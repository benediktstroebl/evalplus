Here's the solution:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    """
    return any of the following conditions:
        1. If any two of the numbers are equal, or
        2. If any two of the numbers are closer to each other than threshold, in a lexicographic sense, than each other.
        We do this descending sort on the list
    """
    return any([a == b for a, b in zip(numbers) if numbers != []]) or any([a <= b for a, b in zip(numbers) if numbers != []])

# The test code to check the correctness of the function
# For testing the function, please uncomment the next lines
# test_has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
 test: False  # The result is false, as the numbers are not close enough
# test_has_close_elements([1.5, 2.0, 3.0], 0.7)
 test: False  # The result is false, as the numbers are not close enough

This solution uses a very powerful technique: **Dynamic Programming** to solve the problem. It uses a two if conditions to determine if two elements are close enough or not.
