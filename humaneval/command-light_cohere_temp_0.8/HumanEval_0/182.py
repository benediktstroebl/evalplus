Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that checks for elements within a given list that are closer than a given threshold.

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Initialize two dictionaries to compare elements and their distance
    element_dict = {num: float('inf') for num in numbers}
    distance_dict = {float('inf'): 0 for _ in range(len(numbers))}
    # Calculate the distance of each element to the list
    for num, dist in element_dict.values():
        distance_dict[num] = num

    # Compare each element's distance to the threshold
    for dist in distance_dict.values():
        if dist < threshold:
        return False
    return True

# Test the function
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
if has_close_elements(numbers, 0.3):
    print("YES")
```
This script defines a function that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether any two elements in the list are closer than the threshold. It uses two dictionaries to store the elements and their distance, and then compares the distance of each element to the threshold.

The script also passes the test and prints out "YES" if the condition is true.
