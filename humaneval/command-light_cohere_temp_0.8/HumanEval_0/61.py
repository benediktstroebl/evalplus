Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you've described: 

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x:math.median(x))
    # Check if the first element is less than the threshold, and if the second element is greater than the threshold
    if numbers[0] < threshold and numbers[1] > threshold:
        return True
    # Check if the first element is greater than the threshold, and if the second element is less than the threshold
    if numbers[0] > threshold and numbers[1] < threshold:
        return True
    # Check if the list is empty
    if not numbers:
        return False
    # Check all pairs of numbers in the list
    for i in range(2, len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i, len(numbers)):
            # Check if the current number is less than the threshold, and if the next number is greater than the threshold
            if numbers[i] < threshold and numbers[j] > threshold:
                return True
    return False


# Test the function
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
print_close_elements(numbers, 0.5)
``` 
This script implements a function called `has_close_elements` that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether the list contains any pairs of numbers that are closer than the threshold.
