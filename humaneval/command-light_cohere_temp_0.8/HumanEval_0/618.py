```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the input list
    numbers.sort()
   
   
    # Keep track of the number of elements
    num_elements = len(numbers)

    # Loop through the sorted list
    for i in range(num_elements - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, num_elements):
            if numbers[j] - numbers[i] < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This Python script defines a function named `has_close_elements` that checks if any two numbers in a given list are closer than a given threshold. The function takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns `True` if any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold, and `False` otherwise. 
The function first sorts the list of numbers. Then, it loops through the two pointers and checks if the current element in the list is smaller than the next element, returning `True` if they are closer than the threshold. The function returns `False` after checking through the entire sorted list.
