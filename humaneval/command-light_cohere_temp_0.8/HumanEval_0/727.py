```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    """
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This code defines a function called has_close_elements that takes in a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold. 

This function uses a loop to iterate over the list of numbers and for each pair of numbers, it checks if the difference between them is less than the threshold. If the condition is met, it returns True, indicating that there are close numbers.

This function is self-contained and does not require any additional imports or external functions. It is a way to solve the problem of checking if any two numbers in a list are closer than each other than a given threshold.
