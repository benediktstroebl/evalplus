Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem of determining if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold. 

The function iterates over the list of numbers, and checks if the difference between any two consecutive numbers is less than or equal to the given threshold. If it is, it returns True, indicating that there are close elements.
