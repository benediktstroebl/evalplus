Here is a self-contained Python script that provides a solution to the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # check if any two elements are closer than the threshold
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This script defines a function `has_close_elements` that checks if any two elements in the list are closer than the given threshold.  The function takes a List[float] and a threshold float as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the list has any pairs of elements that are closer than the given threshold.
