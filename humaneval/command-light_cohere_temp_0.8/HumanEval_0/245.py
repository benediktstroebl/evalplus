Here is a Python script that implements a function `has_close_elements` that checks if any two elements in a list of numbers are closer to each other than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.0) is0.4)]
   2.0.5. The other8 get_ elements [a=[1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0, 0.0, 0.5])
   3.0-1.5]

   5.2.0 and (0.4)
the function is:
    `return any(numbers) < threshold`. The code uses the built-in function `any()` from the `typing` module, to check if there is at least one element in the list that is less than `threshold`.

The function returns `True` if there is a pair of numbers that satisfy this condition, and `False` otherwise.
