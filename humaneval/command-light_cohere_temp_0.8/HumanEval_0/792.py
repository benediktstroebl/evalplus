Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Ensure the list is sorted in ascending order
    numbers.sort()
    - 

    # Define a set of tuples to check against
    good_sets = ((1.0, 2.0),  (0.0, 2.0),  (3.0, 0.0),  (0.0, 4.0),  (4.0, 5.0),  (5.0, 3.0),  (3.0, 0.0))
    

    tuples that are equivalent to checking if the first element in a list is less than the second element.

    # Compare the set against the list
    for good in good_sets, i in numbers:
        if good[i] < threshold:
            return False
    return True

This function works by sorting the input list and using a set data structure to quickly check if any two elements in the list are less than a given threshold.
