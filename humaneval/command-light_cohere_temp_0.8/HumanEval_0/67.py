Here's a self-contained Python function that checks if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold:
```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.

    # sort theof the numbers
    numbers = sorted(numbers)
    for i in range(0, len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This function has an input list of numbers and a threshold. It first sorts the of the numbers list and then checks if any two consecutive elements are closer than the given threshold. The function returns True if it meets any of these conditions, False otherwise.
