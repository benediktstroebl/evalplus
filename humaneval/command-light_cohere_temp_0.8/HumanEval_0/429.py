Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that checks if any two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Type hint to make the function more robust
    numbers = [num for num in numbers]
    return any(abs(num1 - num2) <= threshold for num1, num2 in numbers)
```
This function uses the `abs()` function and the `any()` function to check if any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold. The function returns `True` if any of the conditions are met, and `False` otherwise.
