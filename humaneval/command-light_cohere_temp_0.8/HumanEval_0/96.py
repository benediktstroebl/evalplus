Here's the solution:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.4)
   0.0, 0.3)
   0.2.8, 0.0, 0.0] 
    """0.1.5.6
   0.5.05) # more.0) 

`
The above code checks if any two numbers in the given list are closer than each other than the given threshold. If the above condition is met, then the function returns True. Otherwise, False is returned. 

It uses the List comprehension and Python's built-in function `sorted()` to sort the numbers and check if the corresponding two numbers are closer to each other than the threshold.
