This function checks if in a given list of numbers, any two numbers are closer to each other than the given threshold. If any two numbers are within a given threshold, the function returns True, else False.

The function uses the typing module to ensure that the function has the correct type of parameters and returns.

The function is well-contained, and it does not rely on any other functions or modules. It is a self-contained and self-sufficient, which means that it can be used as a standalone function.
