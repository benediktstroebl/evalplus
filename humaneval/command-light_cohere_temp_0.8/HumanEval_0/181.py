Here is a self-contained Python script that provides a function that solves the problem of checking if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold
    If the distance between two numbers is smaller than the threshold, it will return True
    If the distance is equal to or greater than the threshold, it will return False
    """
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] - numbers[j] < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This function is self-contained and can solve the problem in one block without calling any external function.
