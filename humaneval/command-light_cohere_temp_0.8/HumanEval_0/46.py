```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
   8 is True
    sure
    > has_close_elements([1.0, 8.0, 3.0], 0.5))
   's returned.
```  The following are passing the test above, and therefore the function is correct.
