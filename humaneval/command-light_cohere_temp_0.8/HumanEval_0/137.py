```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Initialize a set to keep track of the numbers that are found in the list
    seen = set()

    # Define a function to check if two numbers are close to each other
    def are_close(num1: float, num2: float) -> bool:
        return abs(num1 - num2) <= threshold

    # Iterate through the list of numbers and add each value to the set
    for num in numbers:
        seen.add(num)

    # Define a boolean indicating if any two numbers in the list are close to each other
    return seen.contains(are_close(numbers[0], numbers[1]))
```
The function has_close_elements takes a List[float] numbers and a float threshold as input and returns a bool value indicating if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the given threshold. 
The function achieves this by using a set to keep track of the numbers that are found in the list, and a function to check if two numbers are close to each other. The function then iterates through the list of numbers and adds each value to the set.

Finally, the function returns a boolean indicating if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the given threshold.
