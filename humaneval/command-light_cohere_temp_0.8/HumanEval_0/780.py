Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort list of numbers
    numbers.sort()
    
    # any index of two consecutive numbers and the corresponding two numbers in the list are closer than threshold
    for i in range(1, len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[i] - numbers[i - 1] < threshold:
            return True
    
    return False
```
This function uses a list of numbers and a threshold to determine if any two consecutive numbers in the list are closer than the threshold. It sorts the numbers, then checks if any two numbers are closer than the threshold, and returns True if so. If no such elements numbers meet this criteria, the function returns False.
