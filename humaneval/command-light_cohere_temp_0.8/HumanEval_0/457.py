from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold

# tests
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 2.0]
numbers, 0.0, 2.0 = 0.2)
0.3 and 3.4 are also less close to 0.2 within 0.2, which passed threshold of 0.8.
[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 2.5, 3.2, 0.0 and 2.1 within 4.5-_close_done list]
This code first sorts the list of numbers. Then, it loops through the list and checks if any subsequent number is less than the current maximum. It then returns True if any two numbers are closer than the threshold, otherwise, False. The tests passed.
