```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
   0
   0)
    False
    """
    The algorithm works by iterating over the list of numbers and compares each pair of elements that are closer than the given threshold. It uses the `is < numbers_in_list > threshold` to filter out all pairs of elements that are not within the threshold range. The function returns `True` if any such pair of elements is not within the threshold range.
