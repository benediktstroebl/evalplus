Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort list of numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort()
   
    done by sorting.
    # Search two numbers in the list that are equal or in close proximity to each other
    numbers.sort() gives a done by sorting.
    for i in range(len(numbers)//2):
        for j in range(i+i+1):
            if numbers[i] <= threshold and numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False

# Test
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0, 0.0, 5, 8]
threshold = 1.5
has_close = has_close_elements(numbers,threshold)
print(has_close)

```
The function returns True if there are any two numbers in the list equal to or in close proximity to each other. The function is tested with the input list of numbers and the threshold.
