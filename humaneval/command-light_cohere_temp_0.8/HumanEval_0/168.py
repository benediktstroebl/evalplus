```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sorting the list of numbers
    numbers.sort(key=lambda x: x)

    # Get the first element of the sorted list
    first_element = numbers[0]

    # Iterate through the list
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        # If the current element is smaller than the first element
        if num < first_element:
            return False

    # If we reached the end of the list and the current element is greater than the first element, it means we skipped some closer elements
    if num > first_element:
        return True

    # If we finished iterating and all numbers are bigger than the first element, we can return True
    return True
```

This code implements a function called has_close_elements that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold. The function uses the sorting the list of numbers, and then uses this information to determine if there are any two numbers that are closer than the threshold. The function returns True if all numbers in the list are bigger than the first element.
