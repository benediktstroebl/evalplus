```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)? Bahns.) Bahns'
    are two numbers that, for any given list, 
    should be considered as the same. 

    For example, numbers [1.0, 2.8] and numbers 
    in the list of numbers that are contained in 
    the list [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 0.8, 0.0, 
    0.1].0] and are also not considered as the same 
    because the two elements have a distance less 
    than the threshold value.
   
The function returns True if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer than the threshold. Otherwise, it returns False.
