Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you've described:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.1)
     or0.25
   5: List[float])
    if any(x for x in numbers if x <= threshold and x != numbers[numbers.index()) and x > threshold:
        return True
    return False


# Example usage
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
threshold = 0.1
has_close_elements(numbers, threshold=0.1)  # True # Check if any two numbers in the list are closer than 0.1 and are not equal to each other, return True.

```

This function uses a List[float] and a threshold value to determine if any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold. The function returns True if any two numbers are not equal to each other, and the list contains at least one number that is greater than the threshold. The function returns False if no such suitable match is found.
