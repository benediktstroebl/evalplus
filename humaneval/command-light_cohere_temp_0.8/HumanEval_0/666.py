Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that checks for any two elements in the list being closer than the threshold value:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # initialize the distance of every pair of elements
    # in the list
    distances = [math.pow(x, math.0) for x in numbers]

    # sort the list by the value of the first element in each pair
    # (used to make sure that the list is sorted
    # according to the threshold value)
    numbers.sort(key=lambda x: x)
    # create a list of comparisons
    # each element is the absolute value of the difference between
    # the second element of the pair and the first
    # (the threshold value is included, so we can ignore
    # equal values and only check the absolute value of the
    # difference, which makes the comparison an "less than")
    comparisons = [x for x in range(len(numbers)) if abs(numbers[x] - numbers[numbers.pop(0)])]

    # sort the list of comparisons by the
    # value of the second element in each pair
    # (used to make sure that the list is sorted
    # according to the condition that is checked)
    comparisons.sort(key=lambda x: x)

    # check if the condition is satisfied
    for comparison in comparisons:
        if distances[comparison] < threshold:
            return True

    return False

# Example of calling the function 
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 5.0, 6.0]
threshold = 0.3

if has_close_elements(numbers, threshold):
    print("The condition is satisfied")
else:
    print("The condition is not satisfied")

```
The provided Python function, 'has_close_elements', is designed to determine whether any elements in a given list are closer than a specified threshold. 

The function first calculates the distance between each pair of elements in the list using the Pythagorean formula. It then sorts the important list of numbers based on the first element in each pair, ensuring that the list is arranged according to the threshold value. 

The function also creates a list of comparisons, where each element corresponds to the absolute value of the difference between the second element of a pair and the first element. 

The function then sorts the list of comparisons based on the value of the second element in each pair, ensuring that the list is ordered according to the condition being checked. 

Finally, the function iterates through the sorted list of comparisons and checks if the condition is satisfied. 

The function returns True if any element in the list satisfies the condition and returns False otherwise. 

This function is a self-contained solution that efficiently checks for the specified condition in a markdown code block.
