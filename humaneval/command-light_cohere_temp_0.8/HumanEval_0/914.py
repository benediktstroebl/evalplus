Here's the self-contained Python script with the function `has_close_elements` that solves the problem:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
   For NO), open
   ```

You can test the function with different lists and thresholds.
