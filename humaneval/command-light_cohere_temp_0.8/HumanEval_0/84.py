Here's a self-contained Python function that checks if any two elements in the list are closer than the given threshold:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    the given threshold.
    """
    list comprehension to create two lists:
    > numbers_list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 0.8, 0.0]
    list [ lst [2,4]
    > numbers.distance_list([0.1, 0.0, 0.8, 0.0])
    also calculate the Duo between two lists:
    > numbers_list.du[(number1-threshold)-numbers.distance() <numbers.distance(threshold)
        Duplicate these two values
    > all other numbers in numbers_list are further than the threshold
    < return True
    """
