```
This Python script defines a function called has_close_elements that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the list contains any two numbers that are closer than the threshold.  The function works by creating two lists: one to keep track of pairs of numbers that are closer than the threshold and the other to keep track of the last index of each pair. The script then iterates through the list elements and checks if the current element is the same as the last index. If it is, the script continues to the next element. 

The script then iterates again from the second list and checks if the current element is closer to the last index than the current element. If it is, the script adds the pair to the first list and updates the last index. 

Finally, the script checks if the first list contains any pairs of numbers that are closer than the threshold.
