```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.

    for index1, i in range(len(numbers)):
        for index2, j in range(len(numbers)):
            if i != j and numbers[i] + numbers[j] <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
This function checks if any two elements in the list are closer than the given threshold. It uses nested loops and compares each pair of elements, and returns true if any condition is met. This function is a most efficient way to find the closest pairs in a list and can be used to solve the problem effectively.
