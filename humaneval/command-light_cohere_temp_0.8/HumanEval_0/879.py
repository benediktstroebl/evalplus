```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.

```

This script defines a function called `has_close_elements` that checks if any two numbers in a given list are closer than a given threshold. It returns `True` if any two numbers are closer than the threshold, and `False` otherwise.
