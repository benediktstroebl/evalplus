Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem:
```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort()
   
    minimum distance between two numbers in the list, using their indices.
    # Define a closest pair of numbers, and their corresponding distances.
    closest = (0, float('inf'))
    closest_distance = 0
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            current_distance = numbers[i] - numbers[j]
            if current_distance < closest_distance:
                closest = (i, j)
                closest_distance = current_distance
    # Return True, indicating that there are any two numbers closer than the threshold
    return True
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns True if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer than the threshold. The function uses the sorting the list of numbers, and then iterates through the list to find the closest pair of numbers and their corresponding distances.
