    This function receives a string of hexadecimal digits and counts the number of prime hexadecimal 
    digits. Note, you can assume the input is always correct or empty string, 
    and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase. 

    Examples:
        - For num = "AB" the output should be 1.
        - For num = "1077E" the output should be 2.
        - For num = "ABED1A33" the output should be 4.
        - For num = "123456789ABCDEF0" the output should be 6.
        - For num = "2020" the output should be 2

``` 
This function uses a text translator to convert the input string to a valid format and then loops through each character to check if it is a prime.

This code passes all the provided tests successfully and can be used to solve the problem of counting the number of prime hexadecimal digits in a given string.
