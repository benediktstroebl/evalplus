```
The function rolling_max takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers with the maximum element found exactly once in the given moment in the sequence. It uses the testing to first find the element in the original list that is also in the list of numbers generated by rotating the sequence, then it returns the list of numbers.

This code is self-contained and uses the function definition to solve the problem and pass the tests.
