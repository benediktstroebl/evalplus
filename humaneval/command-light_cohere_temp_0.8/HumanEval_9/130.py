    Find the maximum element in a list, and then add one to it, 
    and subtract one from the rest, rolling the window over the list.

This script defines a function `rolling_max` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that contains the maximum element from the original list and the rolling maximum element found so far. The code is self-contained and concise, it should help you solve this problem and test it effectively.
