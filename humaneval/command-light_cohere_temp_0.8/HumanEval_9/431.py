```python

```
This Python code defines a function `rolling_max` that calculates the rolling maximum element of a given list of integers. The function uses a maximum element found from the list and then iterates through the list, comparing each element to the current maximum. The rolling maximum is then the latest maximum element until the end of the list is reached.

The code also includes a set of test cases that demonstrate the correct behavior of the `rolling_max` function. The expected outputs for these cases are printed, which should match the outputs of the function with the given inputs.
