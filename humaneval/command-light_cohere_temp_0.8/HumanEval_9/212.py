This Python code defines a function called `rolling_max` that takes a list of integers as input and generates a new list that contains the maximum element from the list after each iteration. The code also includes several test cases to verify the correctness of the `rolling_max` function. 

Here's a brief explanation of the code:
- The `rolling_max` function takes a list of integers as input and iterates through the list using a loop. It initializes the typical starting element as the maximum element found so far (initial value is taken from the first element of the input list). Then, for each subsequent element in the list, it compares it with the current maximum element and updates the maximum if the new element is larger. 
- The code also converts the input list into a Python list to simplify the code.

- The test cases are created with different lists of integers. The `rolling_max` function is then called with each test case, and the results are printed to the console.

- The code includes type hints to provide better code readability and maintainability.
