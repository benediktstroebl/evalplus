This script defines a rolling_max function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers representing the rolling maximum elements found in the sequence up to the given moment.

It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input numbers, calculate the rolling maximum for each number by considering the previous number and the current number, and store the rolling maximum in a list called result. The function also passes the expected unit tests for this function.
