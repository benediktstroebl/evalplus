Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the markdown code block problem:
```python
from typing import List

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    max_count = 0
    current_max = numbers[0]
    max_val = numbers[0]
    
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        if num > current_max:
            current_max = num
        max_count += 1
        
    return [current_max for _ in range(max_count)]

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]
result = rolling_max(numbers)
print(result)
```

This function generates a list of integers that represent the rolling maximum elements found in the sequence. It utilizes a type hint for better code readability and works well for the problem.

The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a list of numbers and display the result.
