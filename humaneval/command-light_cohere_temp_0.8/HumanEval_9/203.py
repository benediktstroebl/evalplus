This script defines a function `rolling_max` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of the rolling maximum elements in the list, following a specific criteria. 
The function uses the sorted() function with a custom comparator to sort the list based on the rolling maximum criteria, and then it returns a list of the remaining elements. 
The script also provides several unit tests for the `rolling_max` function, which should pass successfully.
