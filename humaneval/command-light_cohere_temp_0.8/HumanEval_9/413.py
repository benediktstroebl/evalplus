```python
from typing import List
def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return [num for num, _ in sorted(enumerrange(len(numbers)), key=numbers.get)]
```
```
This code is designed to identify and return the rolling maximum element found within a given sequence of numbers. It employs the critical sorting and accumulation methods to accomplish this.

The rolling_max function takes a list of integers as input and utilizes the sorted() function along with the built-in enumerrange() function to generate a sorted sequence of numbers from the original list. This sequence is then the by applying the key=numbers.get method to the element of the sorted sequence, which effectively gives the index of each element.

This index, along with the corresponding element, is then stored in a list. The list comprehension [(num, index) for num, _ in sorted(enumerrange(len(numbers)), key=numbers.get)] creates this necessary list, where the first element is the original number, and the second element is the index obtained from the sorted sequence.

Finally, the function returns this list of rolling maximum elements.
