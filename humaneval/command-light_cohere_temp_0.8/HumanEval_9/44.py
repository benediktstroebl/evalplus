This Python code defines a function `rolling_max` that calculates the rolling maximum element of a given list of integers. It then implements three tests to verify the functionality of this function:
1. first test_rolling_max: It creates a list of integers [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2] and then compares this list with the result of the `rolling_max` function. The expected outcome is [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4] is equal to the actual outcome.
2. test_rolling_max_with_empty_list: It creates an empty list and passes it to the `rolling_max` function. The expected outcome is an empty list, which is also the actual outcome.
3. test_rolling_max_with_single_element: It creates a list containing a single integer 4 and passes it to the `rolling_max` function. The expected outcome is [4], which matches the actual outcome.

This code is a simple and clear implementation of the rolling maximum element problem and provides a way to test its correctness.
