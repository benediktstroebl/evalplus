This script defines a function `rolling_max` that calculates the rolling maximum element in a list of integers. It uses a method where the first element of the list as the initial maximum value, and the index of the first element is set as the current maximum index. Then, it iterates through the list and compares each element with the current maximum value. The element that is larger is updated as the new maximum, and the current maximum index is updated. Finally, it returns the list containing the rolling maximum elements.

The script then passes three test cases, and the output of each case is displayed, demonstrating that the function correctly calculates the rolling maximum elements.
