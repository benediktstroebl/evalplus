Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the markdown code block problem:
```python
from typing import List

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    max_number = numbers[0]
    seen = [num for num in numbers if num > max_number]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        if num > max_number:
            max_number = num
        elif num in seen:
            seen.else [num]
    max_number
    seen.max_numbers = seen
```
This script defines a function called `rolling_max` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with the maximum elements found up to that list. The function uses the recursive approach to find the rolling maximum elements in the list.
