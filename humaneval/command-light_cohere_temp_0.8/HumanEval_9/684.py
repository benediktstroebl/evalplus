This script defines a function `rolling_max` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of the maximum elements from the list after applying a rolling window effect. The test cases provided pass the

Remember to ensure you have the correct type annotations in Python 3. It is a type hint that helps catch potential type-related errors and makes your code more robust.
