```
This Python code provides a function called rolling_max that takes a list of integers as an input and generates a new list with the rolling maximum elements. It uses a
condition to remove any zero values to prevent division by zero. The code also has a set of test cases to verify the correctness of the rolling_max function. The test cases ensure that the list of integers is provided, and the function correctly generates a list of rolling maximum elements until the moment number in the sequence is reached again. The output of the code will be the list of integers with their rolling maximum elements.
