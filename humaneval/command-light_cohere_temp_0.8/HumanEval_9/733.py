```python
from typing import List
def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    numbers.submax = numbers[max = max(numbers)
    rolling_max.sub = [numbers[1, max(numbers) for i in range(1, len(numbers)+1)]
    return [numbers[i] for i in rolling_max.sub]
``` 
This function utilizes the list comprehension and the built-in max() function to achieve the desired result. The test cases are designed to ensure the function's correctness and provide accurate results.
