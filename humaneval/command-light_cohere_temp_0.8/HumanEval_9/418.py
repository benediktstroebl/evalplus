numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]

```
The function returns a list containing the rolling maximum elements found until the given moment in the sequence. The test case demonstrates the using the same sequence and the function, which correctly identifies the rolling maximum elements in the sequence. 

Note that the sequence used in the test is [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2], which is the same as the sequence defined in the problem statement.
