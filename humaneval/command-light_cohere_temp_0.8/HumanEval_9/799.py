Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of finding the rolling maximum element in a list of integers:
```python
from typing import List

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    From a given list of integers, generates a list of rolling 
    maximum elements found until a given moment in the sequence.
    """
    list of rolling maximum elements is returned.
    """ A list comprehension is rolling iteration is used to find the 
    maximum element in the list, and then shifts the list 
    appropriately to find the next maximum element.
    """
    This maximum list is [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
    """
    return [x for x in numbers][1:]
```

This script provides a function `rolling_max` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of the rolling maximum elements found until a given moment in the sequence. 

It uses a list comprehension with a slicing operation to achieve this. The function runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input list, and the space complexity is O(1) since it uses a constant list comprehension.
