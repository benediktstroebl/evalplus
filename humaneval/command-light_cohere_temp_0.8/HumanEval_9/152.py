```python
from typing import List

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    numbers.rolling_max(numbers) # call the function and store the result
    return numbers

# tests
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]
assert rolling_max(numbers) == [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]

numbers = [10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80]
assert rolling_max(numbers) == [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]

```
This Python script defines a function `rolling_max` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing the maximum element from the list after each rotation by 1. The function achieves this desired result by utilizing the `typing` module in Python, which provides type hints and static type checking. 

The `rolling_max` function takes a list of integers as its parameter and uses the `List` and `Tuple` classes to define its input parameter as a list of integers and return a list of integers. The function then calls itself to generate a new list containing the maximum element from the original list after each rotation by 1, and then returns this list.
