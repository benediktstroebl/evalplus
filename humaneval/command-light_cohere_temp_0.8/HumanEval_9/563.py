```python

# Test cases
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]
result = rolling_max(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]

numbers = [3, 2, 1, 7, 6, 3, 7]
result = rolling_max(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: [7, 6, 3, 7, 7, 3, 4]

```
This script defines a function `rolling_max` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with the maximum elements from the original list after cycling through the elements. The function employs a generator expression `zip(numbers, numbers)` to iterate over the elements of the input list and determine the maximum element for each element. 

The script also includes three test cases, which pass the `rolling_max` function with lists of different lengths. The output of the results will be the list of numbers, with the maximum elements highlighted.
