# Example usage:

```

The provided code includes a self-contained function called `rolling_max` that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests. The function takes a list of integers as input and uses a strategy to find the maximum element in the list, then keeps adding the maximum element to the list, and returns the list of rolling maximum elements found until the given moment in the sequence.

The function returns the list of rolling max elements found until the given moment in the sequence, with the number of elements to be returned being the length of the list minus one.
