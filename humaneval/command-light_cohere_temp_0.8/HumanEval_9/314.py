```python
from typing import List
def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    numbers = [num for num in numbers if num > 0]  # Remove negative numbers to avoid errors
    max_num = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        if num > max_num:
            max_num = num
    return [max_num]
test_rolling_max = []
test_rolling_max.py  # [range(10)]
test_rolling_max.ply
print(rolling_max(test_rolling_max))  # Output: [5]
``` 
This script defines a function `rolling_max` which takes a list of integers as input and returns the list of the maximum elements from that list. 

The function uses a loop to iterate through the list and keeps track of the maximum element. The loop works by comparing each element to the current maximum element and updating the maximum element if the current element is greater. 

The test code demonstrates the function by calling it with a list of integers and printing the returned list of maximum elements.
