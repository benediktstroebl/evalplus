Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of finding the rolling maximum element in a list of integers:
```python
from typing import List

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Generates a list of rolling maximum elements found until a given moment in the sequence.
    >>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]
    >>> rolling_max(numbers)
    [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
    """

    max_roll = numbers[0]
    current_max = numbers[0]
    
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        current_max = max(num, current_max)
        max_roll = max(max_roll, current_max)
    
    return [max_roll]
```
The function utilizes the max() function to compare the current maximum with the current element in the list. It also updates the final maximum to the rolling maximum. The function can accept any test since it returns a list of integers and can be easily evaluated for correctness.
