The provided code defines a Python function named rolling_max that calculates and returns a list of integers representing the rolling maximum elements found up to the current index in a given sequence of numbers. The function utilizes a loop and compares each element with its previous one to determine if it's larger and updates the rolling maximum accordingly. The unit tests are also included, which use the same function with a sample input list and verify that the returned values match the expected output.
