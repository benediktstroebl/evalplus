This Python code defines a function `rolling_max` that calculates the rolling maximum elements in a given list of integers. It utilizes a window of size 3 and a variable `max_val` to keep track of the maximum value. 

The function iterates through the input list and compares each element to the current `max_val`. If the element is larger, it updates the `max_val` and pushes the element into the window. 

The function then returns the window list, which contains the rolling maximum elements found in the original list. 

This code demonstrates the purpose of the function and provides a way to calculate rolling maximum elements in a list of integers.
