```python
from typing import List

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    numbers.boys = [nums.cup()
    Zamfiresian array of integers in some order, and each number appears at most once in the array.
    return [ numbers[numbers]
    return [x for x in numbers if x >= y and y not in numbers]
``` 
This code is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of finding the rolling maximum element in a list of integers. It uses a cup to remove duplicates and then iterates through the numbers to find the rolling maximum element. The code is self-contained within the function and does not rely on any external functions or variables.
