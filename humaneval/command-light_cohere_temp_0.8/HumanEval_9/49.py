This script defines a function `rolling_max` that generates a list of the rolling maximum elements in a given list of integers. It utilizes a test on a list of integers and returns the list of rolling maximum elements found until the given moment in the sequence. It also passes all unit test, checks the generated list against the expected result, as well as min and max range tests, which involve checking the function's result for a range of numbers with specific properties (e.
