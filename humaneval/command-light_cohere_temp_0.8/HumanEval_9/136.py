```python
from typing import List

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    numbers.sort()
    sort_des(numbers)
    return [x for x in numbers if x == max(numbers)]

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]
result = rolling_max(numbers)
print(result)
``` 
The code defines a function `rolling_max` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of the rolling maximum elements in the sequence. It sorts and sorts the maximum elements and the list. This will give the result, which is the list of numbers [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4] in this case.
