This script defines a function `rolling_max` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list of integers that are greater than or equal to the current maximum element in the original list. The function achieves this rolling maximum by selecting elements greater than or equal to the current maximum element found in the original list. The provided test cases demonstrate how the script works correctly for different scenarios.
