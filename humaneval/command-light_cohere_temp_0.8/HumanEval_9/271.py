This Python code defines a function called `rolling_max` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of the rolling maximum elements in the list. 

The function uses a balancing approach with a window size of 3 to efficiently find the rolling maximum elements. The test cases are included to demonstrate the expected behaviour of the function, passing various input lists and printing the resulting list of rolling maximum elements.
