```python
from typing import List

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum elements found until a given moment in the sequence."""
    return [num for num, _ in sorted(enumer, reverse=True)][numbers.contains(n): 1]
```
This code implements a rolling maximum function that takes a list of integers and returns a list of the maximum element from the list at each index. The code uses the for this to work correctly, it relies on the sorted function with reverse=True, which correctly reorders the elements of the list. 

You can use this function by simply passing in the list of numbers that you would like to find the maximum of, and it will return the corresponding list of maximum elements.
