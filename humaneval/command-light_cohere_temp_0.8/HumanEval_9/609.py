Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of finding the rolling maximum elements in a list of integers:
```python
from typing import List

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Keeps track of the current maximum element as we navigate through the list.
    Return a maximum element in descending order.
    """
    maximizes the whole list by returning the list in descending order.
    """

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]
rolling_max = [x for x in reversed(numbers)]
return rolling_max
```

This code defines a function `rolling_max` that takes a list of integers as an argument. The function iterates through the list in reverse order and keeps track of the current maximum element. 

The function returns the list of integers in descending order, effectively finding the rolling maximum elements in the original list.
