This script defines a `rolling_max` function that generates a list of rolling maximum elements from a given list of integers. It uses a maximum value at the initial index, and then uses a loop to compare each element with the current maximum value and update the list accordingly. The test code also passes the required tests to ensure the function's correctness.
