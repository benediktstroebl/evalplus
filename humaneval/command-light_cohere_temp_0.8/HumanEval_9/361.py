```python
from typing import List

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    numbers = List(numbers)  # Convert the input list to a list of integers
    max_element = numbers[0]  # Assume the first element as the maximum element
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        if num > max_element:
            max_element = num
    return [max_element]

# Unit tests
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]
result = rolling_max(numbers)
should_be = [3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
assert list(result) == should_be, "Error: Rolling max does not return expected result."
```

This script defines a function `rolling_max` that calculates the rolling maximum element in an input list of integers. It uses the tested to pass the tests to ensure its correctness. The tests compare the value of the result and expected output from the `rolling_max` function with the input list of numbers.
