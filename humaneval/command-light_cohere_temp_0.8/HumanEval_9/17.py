```python
from typing import List

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    A function that finds the maximum element in the list, 
    and keeps rolling that maximum element across the sequence until another 
    maximum element is encountered.
    >>> Example list [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2] 
    -> [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
    """
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]
    max_element = numbers[0]
    result = [max_element]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        if num > max_element:
            max_element = num 
    result.append(max_element)
    return result
```

The function takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers that contains the maximum element in the list, and the list of the maximum element in the list, rolling it across the sequence until another maximum element is encountered.

The test case provided earlier is also solved correctly by this function.
