```python
from typing import List
def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return [x for x,i in sorted((num for num in numbers), reverse=True) if i <= len(numbers)]

# Test cases
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4]
print(rolling_max(numbers))  # [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(rolling_max(numbers))  # [1, 3, 4, 5]

numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(rolling_max(numbers))  # [2, 3, 4, 5]

numbers = [7, 8, 9, 10]
print(rolling_max(numbers))  # []
```
The function `rolling_max` takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of the rolling maximum elements in the sequence. It uses a use a `sorted` function to sort the elements of the list in descending order and then selects the elements that are less than or equal to the length of the sequence.
