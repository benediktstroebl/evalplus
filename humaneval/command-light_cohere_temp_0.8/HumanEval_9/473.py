This function, rolling_max, takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of their rolling maximum elements. It accomplishes this using a specific moment in the sequence, using a sliding window approach. The function also includes comments that describe its purpose and the way it works, which should help clarify the function's usage and implementation.

The function passes all the tests provided.
