    return numbers

# Test case 1: Check if the function correctly finds the maximum element in the list

The provided Python script defines a function called rolling_max that takes a list of integers as input and generates a new list that contains the rolling maximum elements found within the given moment in the original sequence. The script then contains three test cases to verify the correctness of the rolling_max function:

Test case 1 ensures that the function correctly identifies the maximum element in a list with multiple maximum elements. Test case 2 validates the particular lists of integers and checks if the rolling_max function correctly identifies the maximum elements. Test case 2 is provides an straightforward test case for an empty list, which should return an empty list as well. Finally, test case 3 validates the rolling_max function when provided with a list containing only the number 1, it should return a list containing only 1 as the maximum element.

This script efficiently solves the problem of finding the maximum element in a list and passes all the tests, demonstrating the correctness and reliability of the rolling_max function.
