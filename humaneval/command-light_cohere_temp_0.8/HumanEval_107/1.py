This script defines a function that calculates the count of even and odd integer palindromes within a given range and returns them as a tuple. The function uses list comprehension and filtering to achieve this. 

Note that this function is self-contained, meaning it can be used to calculate the count of palindromes for any given range without relying on any other functions or external variables.
