This function, even_odd_palindrome(n), takes a positive integer n as input and returns a tuple with the number of even and odd integer palindromes. The function uses two counters, even_count and odd_count, to count the number of even and odd integer palindromes from 1 to n.

The function first checks if the current integer is even or odd. If it is even, the counter for that type of palindrome is incremented. If the current integer is odd, the counter for odd palindromes is incremented. The function then returns the number of even and odd integer palindromes as a tuple (even_count, odd_count). 
This self-contained function efficiently solves the problem of counting the number of even and odd integer palindromes in the range from 1 to n, and passes the test with the given input 10.
