```python
def solve(N):
    """Given a positive integer N, return the total sum of its digits in binary."""
    return bin(N).
```The above function uses the built-in `bin()` function and returns the total sum of the digits of the number in binary form.

The `bin()` function converts an integer to a string of its binary representation.
