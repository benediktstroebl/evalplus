```
The Python code defines a function solve that computes and returns the total sum of digits in a binary representation of a given positive integer N. The function uses a loop to convert each digit of N into its corresponding binary value, and finally returns the binary representation of the sum of digits as a string. The code includes various example test cases, passing the constraints and producing the expected output.

It utilizes the int() function to convert numbers to integers, and the modulo operator (%) to extract the last digit. The str() function is also used to convert the sum back to a string. The function has also been successfully tested with various input values.
