```python
def search(nums):
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        if num in freq:
            freq[num] += 1
        else:
            freq[num] = 1
    return max(freq)
# Example usage:
nums = [4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]
result = search(nums)
print(result)  # Output: 2
```
This code defines a search function that aims to find the greatest integer with a frequency greater than or equal to the value itself in a given list of integers. The function works by iterating through the numbers in the list and maintaining a frequency count for each number in a dictionary. The maximum value in the dictionary is then returned, which corresponds to the greatest number with the highest frequency.
