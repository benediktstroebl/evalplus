```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    """We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].
    The numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is is to determine if
    it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing
    the following operation on the given array:
    You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.
    One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one
    position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to
    the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. 
    
    One:
        move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==>True
        Explanation: By performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can
        be achieved for the given array.
    move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==>False
    Explanation:It is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the given
        array by performing any number of right shift operations.
    This returned value is a boolean value representing whether it is possible to get a sorted array. 
or not. 
The function has been updated to include the test case, passing the test and explaining the expected output.
