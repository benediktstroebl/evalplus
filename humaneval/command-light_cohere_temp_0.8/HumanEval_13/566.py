This function greatest_common_divisor calculates and returns the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b. The function handles the particular edge cases, such as when one or both inputs are 0, in which case it returns 0. It also handles the The case where the input numbers have no greatest common divisor, by raising a ValueError exception. The function uses a dynamic programming approach with a while loop that calculates the greatest common divisor by finding the smallest divisor of a number that evenly divides the other number.
