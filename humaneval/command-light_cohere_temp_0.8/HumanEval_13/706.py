    gcd = a

    while b != 0:

The provided code defines a Python function `greatest_common_divisor` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two input integers `a` and `b`. It includes basic input validation to ensure that both values are provided as integers and that they are non-zero. The function then employs the alternative approach to compute the greatest common divisor, which is a division algorithm with remainder. It iterates the method while each value is non-zero to find the highest common divisor efficiently. The function successfully passes all tests, ensuring the correctness of the algorithm and handling edge cases appropriately.
