The function `greatest_common_divisor` in this script accepts two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns the greatest common divisor of the two numbers. It also has tests a with a series of unit tests, and an example of its use. The code is written in a self-contained manner and can be used to solve the problem of finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
