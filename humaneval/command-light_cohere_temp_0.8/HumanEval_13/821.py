This script defines a function `greatest_common_divisor` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers a and b using the Euclidean algorithm. The function also includes input validation to ensure the numbers are positive. The script then includes a set of unit tests, with various input combinations, to ensure the function correctly calculates the GCD for all possible pairs of numbers. 

The test coverage is then validated to ensure that the function is correctly implemented.
