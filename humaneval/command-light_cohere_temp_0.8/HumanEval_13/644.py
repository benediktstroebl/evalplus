Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem of finding the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b:
```python
import math
def greatest_common_divisor(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b)
```

This function computes the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b using the built-in math.gcd() function, which stands for greatest common divisor of two numbers.
