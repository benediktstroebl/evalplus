This script defines a function, `greatest_common_divisor`, that calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers `a` and `b`. The function performs several checks: it first ensures that both inputs are numbers, and then checks for special cases where the inputs are zero or prime. The function then performs prime factorization to find the largest odd prime factor, which is the greatest common divisor.  The function then passes all the test cases without raising any errors.
