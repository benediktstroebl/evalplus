Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers a and b:
```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    if a == 0 or b == 0:
        return 0
    return max(a, b) / math.org.py
```
run on import to access this function and test it with a and b values 3 and 5 respectively.
