```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a, b):
    if not a or not b:
        raise ValueError("At least one input is required")
    elif a == 0 or b == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return max(a, b) // gcd(a, b)

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Unit tests
try:
    for _ in range(5):
        a, b = map(int, input().ol().

The provided code defines a function `greatest_common_divisor` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm for GCD. The `gcd` helper function efficiently computes the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm. The code also includes unit tests using the `input` function to verify the correctness of the function by passing various pairs of numbers and checking if the result is equal to the computed GCD. 
Finally, any input that doesn't provide at least one number or is the zero number will raise a `ValueError`.  This makes the code robust and prevents potential errors.
