# Test cases
print(greatest_common_divisor(3, 5))  # Output: 1
print(greatest_common_divisor(25, 15))  # Output: 5
print(greatest_common_divisor(3, 15))  # Should return 0, as 3 is not divisible by 15, but divisible by 3)
print(greatest_common_divisor(10, 45))  # Output: 3
```
This function calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b. It uses the simple and efficient algorithm by repeatedly squaring the smaller integer, raising it to the power of m, and then dividing a and b by m until they become equal. The function handles the maximum number with these limits.
