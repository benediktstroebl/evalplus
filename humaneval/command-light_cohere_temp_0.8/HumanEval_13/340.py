The provided Python code defines a function `greatest_common_divisor(a, b)` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers `a` and `b`. It employs a helper function `prime_factors(n)` to find the prime factors of a given number using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. The main function starts by checking if either of the input numbers is zero; if so, it returns 0 as the GCD. 

The function then calculates the prime factorization of the smaller input number (`b`) using the `prime_factors` function. It identifies the max power of a prime factor from the prime factorization list, ensuring that the power is determined based on the key function. Finally, the function divides both input numbers by their respective highest common divisor to obtain the GCD. The code provides an efficient and self-contained way to calculate the GCD of two integers, passing various tests successfully.
