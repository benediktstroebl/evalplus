This script defines a function `greatest_common_divisor` which calculates the greatest common divisor of 2 numbers passed as arguments. The function uses the minimum complexity of `O(log(min(a,b)))` to calculate GCD. The test function attempts to pass corresponding tests using a predefined list of test cases.  The script also defines a `main` function that contains the `test` function, which is then called to run the tests.
