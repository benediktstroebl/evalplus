Here is a self-contained Python function that finds the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b:
```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    if a == 0 or b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Both numbers must be greater than zero.")
    elif a == b:
        return 0
    return max(divisor(a, b), divisor(b, a))

def divisor(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    if y == 0:
        return 0
    return x if x != y else y
```

This code follows the approach of finding the greatest common divisor by using the Euclidean algorithm. The code is self-contained and has no external dependencies, it can be easily reproduced and tested.
