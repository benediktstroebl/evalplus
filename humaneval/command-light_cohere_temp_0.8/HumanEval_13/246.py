```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    if a == 0 or b == 0:
        return 0
    elif b == 1:
        return a
    else:
        return greatest_common_divisor(b, a % b)  # Use binary search to find the largest divisor
``` 

This function efficiently calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers a and b using a binary search approach.  It utilizes the { division algorithm by recursively breaking down the problem until the base case is reached. 

This method ensures a fast and optimized solution for finding the greatest common divisor, which is particularly useful for larger numbers.
