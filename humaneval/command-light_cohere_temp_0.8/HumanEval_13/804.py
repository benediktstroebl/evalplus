Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the test cases:
```python
import math
def greatest_common_divisor(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b)
```
The function `greatest_common_divisor` calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers `a` and `b` using the built-in `math.gcd()` function. The function returns a value of the greatest common divisor and returns it as the result.
