# Test case using markdown code block testing

#assert greatest_common_divisor(3, 5) == 1
# This will fail because the GCD of 3 and 5 is 2, not 1

# This will fail because the GCD of 25 and 15 is 20, not 5
```
The code defines a function `greatest_common_divisor` that computes the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b. The function first checks if either a or b is `None` or zero, and returns 0 in such cases. The function then checks if both a and b are equal, and returns 1 if they are. The function then uses a `while` loop to find the greatest common divisor of a and b, by continuously dividing b out from a until it becomes zero. The function then returns the final value of a. class is used to pass a test that is defined at the bottom of the test case. The code also contains a `assert` statement that will fail because the function does not handle invalid inputs correctly.
