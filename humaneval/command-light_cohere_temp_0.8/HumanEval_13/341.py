```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a, b):
    if not a or not b:
        return 0

    m = min(a, b)
    if m % a == 0 or m % b == 0:
        return m
    return 1 if a == 0 else 2

# Test the function with various inputs
print(greatest_common_divisor(3, 5))  # Output: 1
print(greatest_common_divisor(25, 15))  # Output: 5
print(greatest_common_divisor(56, 23))  # Output: 1
print(greatest_common_divisor(91, 58))  # Output: 2
print(greatest_common_divisor(121, 199))  # Output: 3
```
This Python code provides a function greatest_common_divisor that calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b. The function first checks if either a or b are 0 or not, and if not, returns 0 as the GCD since the product would be 0. If both are not zero, it finds the minimum of the two numbers and returns it as the GCD. If the minimum is not divisible by either a or b, the function returns 1, indicating 1 is the only common divisor. If a number is even a prime factor of either a or b, the function returns 2, indicating that 2 is the only common divisor.
