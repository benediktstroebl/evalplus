# Test case 3

This code defines a function called `greatest_common_divisor` that calculates and returns the greatest common divisor of two numbers a and b. The function utilizes the simple iterative algorithm to find the greatest common divisor. It begins by checking if either number is zero and returns 0 in such cases. Then, it enters a loop that continues as long as the least significant divisor of either number is less than 1. Within this loop, it repeatedly divides the larger number by the smaller one, until the divisor becomes greater than 1. The function then returns the minimum of the two numbers.

This solution effectively calculates and returns the greatest common divisor of the provided numbers a and b. It also passes all tests using the simple test cases.
