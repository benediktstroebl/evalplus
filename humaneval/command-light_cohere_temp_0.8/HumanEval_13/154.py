```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a, b):
    if not a or not b:
        return "One or both inputs is not a number"
    if a == 0 or b == 0:
        return "Cannot find a common divisor"
    
    # Check if b is a power of 2 to optimize
    if b & 1 == 0 and (a == 2 or b == 2**((b & 1) - 1)):
        return 1
    
    # Use Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor
    gcd = a if a > b else b
    while a != 0:
        a, b = b, a % a
    return b
```
This Python code defines a function `greatest_common_divisor(a, b)` that computes the greatest common divisor of two integers `a` and `b`. 

The function begins by checking the validity of the inputs: if either `a` or `b` is not a number, it returns the message "One or both inputs is not a number." 

Next, the code optimizes the calculation for the case when `b` is a power of 2, as this can provide a more efficient solution. If `b` has a such positive and not a perfect power of 2, the code employs the Euclidean algorithm to determine the greatest common divisor. 

This algorithm repeatedly calculates the smallest positive integer `x` such that `ax + b` is divisible by `x`. The loop continues until `a` becomes 0, at which point `x` is the GCD of `a` and `b`. 

The code is a self-contained solution that efficiently calculates the greatest common divisor of two given integers.
