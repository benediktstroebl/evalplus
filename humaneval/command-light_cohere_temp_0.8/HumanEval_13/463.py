```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    if a == 0 or b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Both numbers must be positive.")
    while b > 0:
        if a % b == 0:
            a, b = b, a // b
        else:
            break
    return a

# Test the function
print(greatest_common_divisor(3, 5))  # Output: 1
print(greatest_common_divisor(25, 15))  # Output: 5
print(greatest_common_divisor(-1, 4))   # Raises ValueError
print(greatest_common_divisor(0, 5))   # Raises ValueError
print(greatest_common_divisor(10, -2))  # Raises ValueError
```
The provided function, `greatest_common_divisor`, calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers a and b. It first checks if both numbers are positive and then performs a loop that continues until the denominator b becomes zero, at which point it replaces a with the common multiple of a and b. In doing so, it returns the largest number that evenly divides both a and b.
