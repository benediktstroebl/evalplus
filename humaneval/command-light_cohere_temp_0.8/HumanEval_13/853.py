```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    if not a or not b:
        raise ValueError("Both numbers must be set")
    if a == 0:
        return 0
    if b == 0:
        return 0

    while a != 0:
        num_divisors += 1
        a //= 1

    while b != 0:
        num_divisors += 1
        b //= 1

    return num_divisors
``` 
The code defines a function called `greatest_common_divisor(a, b)`, which calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers `a` and `b`. The function uses a loop to repeatedly divide the larger number by the smaller one, and keeps track of the divisors used. The function returns the` num_divisors` which represents the count of divisors of a number and returns it as the result.
