The function `greatest_common_divisor` takes two integers a and b as input and returns the greatest common divisor of a and b. The function first checks if either a or b is `None` and returns 0 as a result. Then, it calculates the prime factorization of both a and b using the `factorize` function. Finally, it computes the common divisor by iterating through the prime factors of b, and taking the product of each prime factor raised to the power of the smallest prime factor. 

This function is self-contained and efficiently solves the problem of finding the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b.
