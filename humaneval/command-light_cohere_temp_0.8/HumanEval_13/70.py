This Python script defines a function called greatest_common_divisor(a, b) that calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b. The function first checks if either a or b is None, and if so, raises a ValueError. 

Then, it uses an optimized algorithm that iterates through the numbers from 1 up to the min of a and b, and checks for divisibility. If a common divisor is found, it returns the value; otherwise, it returns the largest number. 

The script also includes a test case that validates the behavior of the function when given non-numeric inputs, and another set of test cases that ensures the function correctly calculates the GCD for lists of integers.
