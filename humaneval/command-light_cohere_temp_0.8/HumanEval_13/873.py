This code defines a `greatest_common_divisor` function that computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`. It handles edge cases where either of the inputs is 0, and it performs an efficient algorithm using the idea of computing all divisors of a number less than or equal to another, and then finding the highest among them.
