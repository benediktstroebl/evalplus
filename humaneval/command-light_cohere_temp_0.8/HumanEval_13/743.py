```
The provided Python function, `greatest_common_divisor`, calculates and returns the greatest common divisor of two integers `a` and `b`. It first checks if both numbers are set, and if either is zero, it raises a `ValueError`. Then, it identifies the prime factors of `a` using a loop, ensuring that each divisor doesn't repeat. The loop continues until `a` becomes 1. 

Lastly, it finds the highest divisor among these prime factors, ensuring it's the one with the highest number of factors. This function is concise and self-contained, solving the problem of finding the greatest common divisor efficiently.
