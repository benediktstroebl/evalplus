This Python function calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers `a` and `b`. It handles cases where the input is either 0 or one of the numbers, adjusts the larger value to positive if necessary, and employs the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.  The then starts by iterating from the smaller number and keeps adding the divisor to the larger number until the smaller number becomes zero, indicating a common divisor has been found.
