```
The function greatest_common_divisor(a, b) calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b. The function first checks if both numbers are zero, in which case it returns 0. It then determines which number is larger and sets the variable larger to that number. The function then iterates, starting from the larger number, adding the largest number to itself as a divisor until the number becomes divisible by both. Finally, it returns the largest number, which is the greatest common divisor.
