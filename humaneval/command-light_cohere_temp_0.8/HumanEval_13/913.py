```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    if not a or not b:
        return 0

    # Find the greatest divisor of a and b
    gcd = max((a, b))

    # Return the greatest common divisor
    return gcd

# Test case 1
print(greatest_common_divisor(3, 5))  # Output: 1

# Test case 2
print(greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)))  # Output: 5

# Test case 3
print(greatest_common_divisor(7, 12)))  # Output: 4
```
The function greatest_common_divisor(a, b) calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b. By comparing their two values and choosing the largest result, we determine the greatest common divisor. This method is efficient and straightforward for determining the GCD of two numbers.
