# Unit tests
print(greatest_common_divisor(3, 5))  # Output: 1

```
This script defines a function greatest_common_divisor that calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b. The function uses the algorithm that factorizes both numbers into a list of prime powers, then finds the highest power of any common divisor and returns its product. The unit tests ensure the result is correct.
