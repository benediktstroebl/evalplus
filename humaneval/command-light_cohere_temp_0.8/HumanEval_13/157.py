```python

    elif a == 0 or b == 0:

# Test cases
print(greatest_common_divisor(3, 5))  # Output: 1
print(greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)))  # Output: 5
print(greatest_common_divisor(15, 25)))  # Output: 5
print(greatest_common_divisor(12, 17)))  # Output: Returns 0 in this case
```  This Python code defines a function called greatest_common_divisor that calculates and returns the greatest common divisor of two given integers a and b. The function uses the efficient trial-and-error free algorithm to find the greatest common divisor. It uses a basic arithmetic and loops until it finds a number that divides both a and b without a remainder. The test cases section demonstrates the use of the function with various input pairs, and the output is printed to the console.
