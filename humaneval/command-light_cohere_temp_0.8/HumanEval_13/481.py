```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    if not a or not b:
        return 0

    # Remove non-zero multiples from b to get closer to prime factorization
    b = int(math.ceil(b))

    # prime factorization
    factors = []
    while b > 1:
        factors.append(b)
        b //=1
        b //= 2

    # Find the highest common divisor from the lists of prime factors of a and b
    common_divisors = [d for d in factors if d != 1]
    return max(common_divisors)

# Test the function
# test cases
test_gcd = greatest_common_divisor
test_gcd(3, 5) --> 1
