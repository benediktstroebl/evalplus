This code defines a function `greatest_common_divisor` that computes the greatest common divisor of two integers `a` and `b`. It uses a specialized algorithm, the Euclidean algorithm, which efficiently calculates the GCD. The function raises a quick a ValueError if either input is the zero, ensuring that the function is used correctly.

The function is also tested with several cases, which verify its correctness by asserting that the output is the correct value for the given inputs. This comprehensive function should now solve the common divisor problems efficiently and accurately.
