```python

    s1 = 0
    s2 = 0

    while b > 0:
        if b & 1:
            s1 += a
        a = a // b
        b -= 1
    if b == 0:
        break

    return s1
``` 
This code defines a function called `greatest_common_divisor` that computes the greatest common divisor of two numbers `a` and `b`. 

It uses an efficient method that splits the division process into two parallel loops: one for the larger number (divisible by `b`), and the other for the remainder when this number is divided by `b` times. The two numbers are then calculated independently, and only the larger one is added to `s1`.
