```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a, b):
    if not a or not b:
        raise ValueError("At least one input is zero")
    elif a == 0 or b == 0:
        return 0  # Return 0 as a divisor for any non-zero number
    elif b == 1:
        return a
    elif a == 1:
        return b
    else:
        return max(a % b, b % a)  # Find the greater divisor between a and b
```
This code defines a function `greatest_common_divisor` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers a and b. It handles edge cases, checks for division by zero, and in the case of very small numbers, it returns 0 as the greatest common divisor. The function also handles the original code is then complete.
