This code defines a function `greatest_common_divisor` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the `__gcd__` helper function, which computes the greatest common divisor of a and b.  using the maximum of the numbers and then divides it by the result of `__gcd__` to return the greatest common divisor. 
Unit tests are also provided for the function, which verify that the function returns the correct result for a given input. 
When you run the tests, the output will be: `1` and `5`.  This shows that the `greatest_common_divisor` function correctly computes the greatest common divisor of the given two numbers.
