```python
def is_multiply_prime(a):
    """
    Returns True if a is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, 
    and False otherwise. 
    Returns: smallest prime factor of a 
    """
    if a <= 100:
        return a == 2 * 3 * pk
    else:
        return False
```

This code defines a function `is_multiply_prime` that checks whether a number `a` is the multiplication of three prime numbers. It uses the's smallest prime factor of a approach, which efficiently determines whether a number is prime or not.
