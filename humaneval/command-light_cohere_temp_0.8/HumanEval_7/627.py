```python
from typing import List
def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.find(substring)]
```
This Python code defines a function called `filter_by_substring`, which filters a list of strings to include only those that contain a given substring. It utilizes the specific testing with the List[str] and substring types to ensure type safety and provide a clear and readable definition of the function.
