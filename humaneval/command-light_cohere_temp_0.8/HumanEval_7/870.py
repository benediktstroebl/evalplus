Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function `filter_by_substring`:
```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    return [string for string in strings if string. contains substring]
```
This function takes a list of strings and a substring, and returns a new list containing only the strings from the input list that contain the given substring. 

This is a self-contained function, as it does not rely on any other functions or modules, and can be fully expressed within the script.
