The provided code looks correct and is a self-contained solution to the problem. It defines a filter_by_substring function that takes a list of strings and a substring as input and returns a new list of strings that contain the given substring.

The function uses the `filter()` built-in function with a lambda function to filter out the strings from the list that do not contain the substring. 

The solution and passed tests are accurate, and the function will correctly filter the strings for the given substring.
