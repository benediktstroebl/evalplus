The provided Python code defines a function filter_by_substring that filters an input list of strings for a given substring. The function uses the another `List` of strings and a `substring` as parameters. 

Here is the explanation of the code:
- The function `filter_by_substring` is defined with two parameters: `strings`, which is a list of strings, and `substring`, which is a string to find in the strings.
- The function returns a list of strings that contain the given substring.
- The `strings` parameter is a list of strings, and the `substring` is a string to find in the strings.
- The function uses the `filter()` function to create a new list that contains only the strings from `strings` that contain the `substring`.
