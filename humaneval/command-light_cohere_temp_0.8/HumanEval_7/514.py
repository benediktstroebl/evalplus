The provided Python code defines a function called **`filter_by_substring`** that filters a list of strings based on whether the given substring is present in each string. This function utilizes the advertising list of strings as its parameter, and the given substring is compared with each string using the **`in`** operator. The resulting filtered list is then returned by the function.

Here's a breakdown of the code:
- **`from typing import List`** — This line imports the **`List`** type from the **`typing`** module.
- **`def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:`** — This line defines a function called **`filter_by_substring`** that takes two parameters: a list of strings (**`strings`**) and a substring (**`substring`**).
- **`return []`** — If the length of the input list is 0, indicating an empty list, the function returns an empty list.
- **`return [string for string in strings if substring in string]`** — This line uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the input list. It uses the string matching with the **`substring`** to check if the substring is present in the string.
- **`return [substring for string in strings if substring in string]`** — This line is similar to the previous line, but it uses the substring matching with the input list to check if the substring is present in the string.
- **`def test_filtering(test_strings, test_substrings):`** — This line defines a function called **`test_filtering`** that takes two parameters: a list of strings (**`test_strings`**) and a list of substrings (**`test_substrings`**).
- **`return filter_by_substring(test_strings, test_substrings)`** — This line calls the **`filter_by_substring`** function with the arguments **`test_strings`** and **`test_substrings`** to test its functionality.

The output of this code will be the same as the provided markdown code.
