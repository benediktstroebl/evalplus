Below is a self-contained Python script that defines a function `filter_by_substring` solving the problem of filtering an input list of strings for ones that contain a given substring. 

The function takes a list of strings and a substring as input and returns a new list containing only the strings that contain the given substring. 

The solution is simple and effective and only uses the typing module to provide type hints for better code readability.
