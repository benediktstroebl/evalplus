The code solves the problem of filtering an input list of strings that contain a given substring. The function `filter_by_substring` takes two parameters: `strings`, which is a list of strings, and `substring`, which is a string to find. It uses the certain list comprehension with the `filter()` function to achieve the filtering.

Here's how it works:
1. `strings`: It list of strings in which you want to filter.
2. `substring`: The string that you want to find.

Here are some examples of how the function can be used:
- `>>> filter_by_substring([], 'a')`: Returns an empty list, because no strings in the input list contain the substring 'a'.
- `>>> filter_by_substring(['abc', 'bacd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')`: Returns a list with the strings that contain the substring 'a', which are 'abc' and 'array'.

This Python script provides a self-contained function that effectively filters an input list of strings based on a given substring.
