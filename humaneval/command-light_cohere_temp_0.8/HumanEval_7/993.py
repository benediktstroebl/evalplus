```python
from typing import List


def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    return [string for string in strings if string.contains(substring)]
```
This Python code defines a function called **`filter_by_substring`** that filters a list of strings to retain only those that contain a given substring. The function utilizes the types to ensure the function is self-contained and can pass all tests.
