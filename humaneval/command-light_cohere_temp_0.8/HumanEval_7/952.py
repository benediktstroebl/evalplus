The function `filter_by_substring` is designed to filter an input list of strings based on a given substring.

- The function takes two parameters: `strings`, which is a list of strings, and `substring`, which is a string to search for within the strings.
- The function returns a new list of strings that contain the substring.

- The function uses the `filter()` method with a lambda function to create a new list that contains only the elements from `strings` that contain the `substring`.
