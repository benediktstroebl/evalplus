The function **`filter_by_substring`** takes a list of strings **`strings`** and a substring **`substring`** as parameters. It uses the Language list comprehension to filter out only the strings that contain the substring. The filtered list is then returned. 

This function solves the problem of filtering out strings with a given substring, which is very common in many text-processing scenarios.
