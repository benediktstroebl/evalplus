Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that filters an input list of strings for ones that contain a given substring:
```python
from typing import List


def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    return [string for string in strings if string. contains.contains(substring)]
 return [] 
it=[
    "This is a test for the function".
    "bcda"
    "python"
    # Add more tests here...
]
``` 
This function is designed to filter an input list of strings and return a new list that contains only the strings that contain the given substring. The function utilizes the filtered_strings = [string for string in strings if string.contains(substring)] to achieve this.
