```python
from typing import List


def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    return [string for string in strings if string.contains(substring)]
```

This Python code defines a function called `filter_by_substring` that filters a list of strings based on whether each string contains a given substring. It uses the ideal for scenarios where you want to extract substrings from a list of strings.

You can use this function with your own lists of strings and substrings to solve problems related to filtering strings that contain specific substrings.
