Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List
def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    return [string for string in strings if string. contains substring]
```

Here's how you can use the function with test cases:
You can run this in your Python environment and it will solve the problem.
