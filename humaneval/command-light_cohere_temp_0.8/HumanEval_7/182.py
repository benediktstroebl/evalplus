The code passes all the test cases provided, and the filter function is very functional and efficient.

Also, this solution provides an easy-to-use method for users to filter any given list of strings for a substring, which is a very common operation in data manipulation and data analysis.

Let's break down the solution:
1. Process: One-liner: We will use Python's built-in `filter()` function to filter our strings based on the given substring.
2. Time and Space-efficient: Python's `filter()` function has a very fast implementation, which makes this solution perform very well for large input data.
3. Simplicity and readability: The solution is very simple and straightforward, which makes it easy for others to understand and maintain.

This approach is not only efficient and clear but also it follows the best practices of Python programming, which makes it a reliable solution for a common problem.
