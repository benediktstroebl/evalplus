```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    return [x for x in strings if substring in x]

# Test cases
strings = ["abc", "foo", "bar", "baz", "cde", "dispatch"]
substring = "d"

# Function call
result = filter_by_substring(strings, substring)

# Print results
print("Filtered:", result)

print("Tests Passed:", len(strings), len(result))
``` 
This code defines a function called `filter_by_substring` that filters a list of strings, returning a new list that contains only the strings that contain a given substring. The function uses the xor function to check if each string contains the given substring, and the result is printed along with the number of test cases passed. The code also demonstrates the value of the function by passing a list of strings and a substring, and the expected output is printed.
