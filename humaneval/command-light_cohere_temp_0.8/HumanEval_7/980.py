Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of filtering an input list of strings for those containing a given substring:
```python
from typing import List


def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    return [string for string in strings if string. contains.contains(substring)]
 filter_by_substring([ 'abc'.upper(), 'bacd'.upper(), 'cde'.upper(), ['array', 'abcd'])
```
This script defines a function that filters an input list of strings by checking if each string contains the given substring. It uses the important to pass the tests and is self-contained, as it does not depend on the content of any other variables.
