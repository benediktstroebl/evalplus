Here's the self-contained Python script that solves the problem you described:
```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    return [string for string in strings if string. contains.find(substring)]
 done!
```

This script defines a function called `filter_by_substring` that takes a list of strings and a substring as arguments. The function uses the filtering using the `find()` method to find instances of the substring in the input strings.
