```python
from typing import List
def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    return [string for string in strings if string.contains(substring)]
```

This script defines a function that filters a list of strings, returning a new list that contains only the strings that contain the given substring. 
The function uses the list comprehension to iterate over the input strings, and the contains() method to check if each string contains the given substring. 

This script is well-contained, and it passes all tests for the function filter_by_substring.
