Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of filtering an input list of strings that contain a given substring:
```python
from typing import List


def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    return [string for string in strings if substring in string]

# Example usage
strings = ['abc', 'bacd', 'cde', 'array', 'text']
substring = 'a'
filtered_strings = filter_by_substring(strings, substring)
print(filtered_strings)
``` 
This function is designed to filter a list of strings and return a new list containing only the strings that contain the given substring. It uses the using Python's list comprehension to iterate over each string in the input list and check if the substring is present in that string. The function is self-contained, and it passes the tests provided with the example usage.
