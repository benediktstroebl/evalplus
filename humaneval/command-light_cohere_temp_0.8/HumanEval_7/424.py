The provided code above is a Python script with a self-contained function that filters an input list of strings based on a given substring. 

The function **`filter_by_substring`** takes a list of strings and a substring as input and returns a new list that contains only the strings from the input list that contain the given substring. 

This is a self-contained solution and passes the corresponding tests. 

The solution employs a recursive approach to filter the strings in the list based on the given substring. It leverages the string slicing and the Python in-built functions to achieve this.
