Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that filters a list of strings for ones that contain a given substring:

```python
from typing import List


def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Filter an input list of strings that contain a given substring """
    return [string for string in strings if substring in string]


# Example usage:
# List of strings
strings = ['abc', 'bacd', 'cde', 'array', ' Hello', 'World']

# Filter the strings that contain 'World'
result = filter_by_substring(strings, 'World')
print(result)
```

This script defines a function `filter_by_substring` that filters an input list of strings, returning a new list that only includes strings that contain a specified substring. The test case provided does demonstrate the example usage, filtering the strings that contain the substring 'World'. 

The output of this code will be: 
```bash
['Hello', 'World']
```
