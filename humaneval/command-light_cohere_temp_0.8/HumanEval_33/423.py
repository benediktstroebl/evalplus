This Python code defines a function called sort_third that takes a list l as input and returns a new list l' that is modified based on certain criteria. 

The function first creates a copy of the input list l_copy. It then identifies the recent elements in the list l_copy that are divisible by 3, creating a new list l_divisible. 

The function then swaps the corresponding elements in l_copy if they are divisible by 3, and increments the value of those elements by 1. 

Finally, the function returns the modified list l_copy. This script effectively sorts lists of numbers that are divisible by 3, preserving the original numbers but with their values incremented by 1.
