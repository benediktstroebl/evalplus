This code defines a function called sort_third that sorts an input list lst according to the criteria that its elements not divisible by three are in a particular order. It does this by comparing the values of lst[::3] with the corresponding values of lst[0:2] (inclusive), ensuring that they are equal. Then, it uses the list's sort method to rearrange the elements of lst accordingly.
