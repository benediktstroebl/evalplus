```  This Python script defines a function called sort_third that takes a list l as input and returns a modified list l'. The function uses a lambda function as the key argument of the sorted function to sort the list based on values that are divisible by three, and then uses the sorted function to sort the values that are divisible by three. 

Please note that the function is self-contained and does not require any additional variables or functions to solve the problem.
