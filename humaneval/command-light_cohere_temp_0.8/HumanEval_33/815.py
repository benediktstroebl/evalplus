```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted."""
    new_list = []
    for num in l:
        if num % 3 == 0:
            new_list.append(num)
        else:
            new_list.append(num) 
                               if num < 0:new_list.append(num+ ) else:new_list.append(num))
    new_list.append(num)
    new_list.sort()
    new_list is the list l but the values are in the order of divisibility by three. The return of this function is the list l' with all the elements of l preserved, but in a different order.
```

Here is the test code to check the correctness of the above function:
```python
def test_sort_third():
    l = [1, 2, 3]
    assert sort_third(l) == [1, 2, 3]
    l = [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]
    assert sort_third(l) == [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```
