This Python script defines a function called `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a list `l_new`. It aims to sort the list such that values at indices that are divisible by 3 are kept as they are, while values at indices that are not divisible by 3 are repositioned to be sorted. 

The function uses two lists, `l_divisible` and `l_not_divisible`, to create a new list `l_new`. The function then returns `l_new`, which will have the desired sorting applied. 

The `sort_third` function has been successfully implemented and passes the tests, as it correctly sorts lists and handles the edge case of an empty list.
