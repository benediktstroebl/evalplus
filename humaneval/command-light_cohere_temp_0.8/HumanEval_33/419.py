```python

Compare the function using the test_sort_third function:

    assert sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]) == [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    assert sort_third([5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) == [6, 7, 8, 9]
    assert sort_third([10, 20, 30]) == [30, 10, 20]
    assert sort_third([40, 50, 60]) == [60, 40, 50]
    assert sort_third([3, 3, 3]) == [3, 3, 3]
