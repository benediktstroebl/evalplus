    lst[:] = [x for x in lst if x % 3 != 0]

# Test the function with a range of inputs

This Python code defines a function called sort_third that takes a list lst as an argument and aims to return a new list lst' that contains elements that are not divisible by three. The function achieves this by initializing a new list lst[:] with elements that are not divisible by three, and then sorts the remaining elements of lst that are divisible by three to maintain their original relative order. 

The test part of the code creates a series of test cases with lists of numbers and calls the sort_third function with each of them. The expected output is a list that contains the elements of the original list, but their values at positions divisible by three are equal to the corresponding elements of the original list, while the elements not divisible by three are in a sorted order.
