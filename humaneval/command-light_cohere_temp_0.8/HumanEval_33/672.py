```  The function is well-contained and passes the test for all the given inputs. It is the list of numbers, it uses the map function to convert each element into an integer and then sorts the list. The sorted list is converted into a list of the numbers divisible by three, which is identical to the original list but sorted. The list of numbers less than than 0 and greater than 1 is passed to the function as input, and the function returns a list of the numbers divisible by three.
