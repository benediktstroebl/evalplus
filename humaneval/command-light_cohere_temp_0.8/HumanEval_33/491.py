```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted."""
    definition is simple case of the input list is a list of integers, and the output list is also a list of integers. This function uses the need to change the values of the input list in the way described above, and the output list is then returned.
```
def test_sort_third(test_cases):
    for test_case in test_cases:
        l = [test_case[i] for i in range(len(test_case))]
        l = sort_third(l)
        assert l == test_case
        print("Case passed:", end()")

# Example test cases
test_cases = [[1, 2, 3], [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2], [100, 101, 102]]
test_sort_third(test_cases)
```
This script defines a function sort_third that sorts a list of numbers in a specific way. The function takes a input list and returns a new list with the same elements but potentially different order. The test_sort_third function contains tests for the sort_third function, which are designed to check that the function works correctly. The test cases include a input list with a variety of numbers, and the function is expected to return a list that is the same as the input list, but sorted in a specific way.

This code can be executed to verify the correctness of your function sort_third and test its behavior for different inputs.
