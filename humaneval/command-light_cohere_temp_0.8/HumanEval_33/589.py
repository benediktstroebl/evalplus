This script defines a function `sort_third` that sorts a list so that the values of elements which are not divisible by three are in the front, and the other values are in the back. It achieves this by utilizing the key function, which returns -1 if the value is divisible by three, and 0 otherwise. The function also defines another function `divisible`, which checks whether a given number is divisible by a given number.

The test code then uses the `sort_third` function to sort a list of numbers and prints the sorted list. This will correctly output the
