The script defines the `sort_third` function that sorts an input list `lst` according to a specific rule: it moves values that are divisible by three to their respective positions, while keeping the original order for the remaining values. The function also has several unit tests that verify its correctness, passing all the tests. This helps ensure the confirming that the `sort_third` function works as expected.
