This Python code defines a function named `sort_third` that takes a list `lst` as input and returns a new list `new_lst` where elements divisible by three are moved to the front. The function uses this list comprehension to identify these elements and then adds them to the front of the new list using the `append` method. The resulting list is then be sorted using the built-in `sorted` function with ascending order. The test cases verify that the function correctly handles different types of lists and passes all the tests.
