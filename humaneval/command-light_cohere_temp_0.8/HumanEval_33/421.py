    l = [1, 2, 3]

```
The above code defines a function `sort_third` which sorts a list of numbers such that each number not divisible by three will stay in the same relative position, while numbers divisible by three will be in the same relative position as in the original list. The test_sort_third function tests the `sort_third` function with a known correct answer and asserts if the input list and the expected output are equal, ensuring the correctness of the sorting function.
