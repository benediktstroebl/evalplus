    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted.

    Test case the region, l is passed in as a list to this function,
    and the function returns a new list l' that is sorted using the above
    logic.

    The list can be empty, this function will return an empty list.

    Test if the first argument is not a list, this function will raise a TypeError.
