```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted."""

    way to pass the suppose the function to work without bug, by removing the dividing by three in the division operation, then comparing the original value with the first value of the list. This way also ensures that the removing the divisor makes the function self-contained."""
    l.remove(l[0])  # remove the first element of the list which is divisible by three
    l = [i for i in l if i not in [0]]  # remove all elements divisible by three
    l = sorted(l)  # sort the list after removing the duplicates
    return l  # return the sorted list
```
This function takes a list l and returns a new list l', which is identical to l in every element that is not divisible by three, and its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding index in l, but sorted. This ensures that the removing the duplicate elements and sorting the list, you can solve this problem in a self-contained way.
