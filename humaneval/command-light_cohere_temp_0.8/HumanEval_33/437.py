This Python code defines a function sort_third that sorts a list lst according to a specific criteria. The function takes a expected input of a list lst and returns a sorted list lst' such that the values at indices that are not divisible by three are sorted to the front (ascending by the sort order), while the remaining values, which are divisible by three, are sorted normally. The test_sort_third function is also defined, which contains a series of assertions that verify the correctness of the sort_third function with various input lists. The code also runs the source code by calling the test_sort_third function, which executes the sort_third function and verifies its correctness.
