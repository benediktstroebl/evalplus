```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted."""
    return [x if x % 3 == 0 else x if x % 3 != 0 else x for l[i] for i, x in enumerate(l)]

# Example test cases
test_list = [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]
test_list_sorted = sort_third(test_list)
print("Test list sorted:", test_list_sorted)

test_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
test_list_sorted = sort_third(test_list)
print("Test list sorted:", test_list_sorted)

test_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]
test_list_sorted = sort_third(test_list)
print("Test list sorted:", test_list_sorted)

test_list = [8, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 4]
test_list_sorted = sort_third(test_list)
print("Test list sorted:", test_list_sorted)
```

The above Python script defines a function called sort_third, which takes a list as input and generates a new list where elements divisible by three are left unchanged, while other elements are sorted. The script also provides a test cases to validate the functionality of the sort_third function.
