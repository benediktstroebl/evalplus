The script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a list `l'` that satisfies the specified requirements. The function uses list comprehension to create a new list `l'` that includes elements from `l` that are not divisible by three, as well as elements that are divisible by three. The second list comprehension creates a list that preserves the relative order of the elements from the original list `l` while satisfying the specified requirements.
