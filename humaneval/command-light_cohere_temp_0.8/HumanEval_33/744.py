This Python function, `sort_third`, sorts a list such that the values at indices that are not divisible by three are in the same relative order, and the values at indices that are divisible by three are sorted lexicographically. The function then returns the value of the list. The function is tested by passing a list of numbers through the function, and the output is printed to the console. The function is also designed to pass all of the corresponding tests.
