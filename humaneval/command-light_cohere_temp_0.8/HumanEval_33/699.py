```python
def sort_third(lst):
    """This function sorts a list l such that values not divisible by three stay in their original order, and the rest are rearranged.
    
    Args:
        lst (list): list to be sorted
    
    Returns:
        list: list where values divisible by three are in their original order, and the rest are rearranged.

def test_sort_third(lst):
        """This function checks whether sort_third works correctly on a given list."""
        return sorted(lst) == lst

    ```

The above script defines a function sort_third that sorts a given list lst such that values not divisible by three remain in their original order, and the rest are rearranged. The function also includes a test_sort_third function, which checks whether sort_third works correctly on a given list lst.
