```
The function `sort_third` takes a list `lst` as input and returns a sorted list `lst` where all numbers greater than 3 are at the beginning. It uses the `sorted()` function from the standard library with a custom key function `key=lambda x: x`. This function sorts the list in the way specified in the docstring. 

The test cases validate the expected output of the `sort_third` function.
