This Python script defines a function called sort_third that takes a list lst as input and returns a sorted list lst' such that values at indices divisible by three are in their correct relative order. The function achieves this by creating two separate lists, lst1 and lst2, one with odd values and the other with even values. Then, it concatenates these two lists and sorts the concatenated list using the sorted() function. The output is a sorted list in both cases.
