```python
def sort_third(lst):
    """Sorts the list l such that elements divisible by three are in their correct positions."""
    lst[:] = [x for x in lst if x % 3 == 0] + [x for x in lst if x % 3 != 0]  
    return sorted(lst)

# Test cases 

```
- [1, 2, 3] -> [1, 2, 3]
- [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2] -> [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
- [x, y, z] where x, y, z are all numbers and can be divisible by 3, or not.

This code defines a function that takes a list lst and returns a sorted list lst such that elements divisible by three are in their correct positions.
