```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted.

    Test cases on a are passed with the input list and print the expected output, which includes the original list, the list without the numbers divisible by three, and the list with the numbers divisible by three rearranged.

    Test that the base case that the function handles the input correctly, and the output matches the expected output.

``` 
The Python script defines a function `sort_third` that sorts a list according to the third number. The script then tests the process that the function handles the input correctly and produces the expected output.
