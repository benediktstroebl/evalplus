In this approach, we first define sets to store numbers divisible by three and numbers not divisible by three. Then, we define a list of numbers sorted by value and split it into three lists: numbers divisible by three, numbers not divisible by three, and numbers already sorted by value. Finally, we combine the lists in order to get the final sorted list.
