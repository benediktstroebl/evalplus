```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted."""
    rationale:
    Values that are divisible by three will be the same when sorted, so we can take advantage of this property to create the result more efficiently.

    """For example, consider the list [1, 2, 3]. The values at indices 1 and 3 are divisible by three and therefore will be the same when sorted. So, we can return the list [1, 2, 3] as the sorted list.
    """ return sorted(l, key=lambda x: not(x%3))
