# Example usage:
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```
This code defines a function called sort_third, which takes a list l as input and returns a new list l'. The function sorts the list l such that the elements that are divisible by three will maintain their relative order, while the other elements that are not divisible by three will have their values replaced with the corresponding elements from l, but will keep the same relative order.
