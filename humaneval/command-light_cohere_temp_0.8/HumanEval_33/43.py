This script defines a function, `sort_third`, that takes a list as input and returns a sorted list based on a specific criteria. It uses the specific logic to identify the indices that are divisible by three and keeps the values at those indices the same, while moving the other values to their correct positions. 
Finally, it returns a sorted list.
