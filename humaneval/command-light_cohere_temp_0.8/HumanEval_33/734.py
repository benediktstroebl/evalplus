This script defines a function called sort_third that takes a list as input and returns a sorted list where numbers divisible by three are in their original order and numbers not divisible by three are in ascending order. The function uses two for loops, the first one checks if the number is divisible by three and adds it to the list of numbers divisible by three, the second one uses the built list to sort the numbers not divisible by three in ascending order.
