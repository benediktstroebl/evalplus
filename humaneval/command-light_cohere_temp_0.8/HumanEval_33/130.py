This Python script presents a self-contained function called `sort_third` designed to sort a given list `lst` such that the values at indices that are not divisible by three are kept in their original relative order, while the values at indices that are divisible by three are sorted in ascending order. The script employs three helper functions: `divisible_indices` identifies indices of elements in the list that are divisible by a given divisor, `sort_largest` sorts the list based on the largest values first, and `sort_smallest` sorts the list based on the smallest values first. These helper functions are facilitating the most comprehensive sorting of lists with values that can be divided.
