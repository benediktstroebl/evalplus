This Python script defines a function named sort_third that arranges a list's third elements in ascending order. The function takes a dry-type arguments and employs list comprehension to swap corresponding elements if they are divisible by three. The script then conducts thorough testing using a variety of test cases, all of which are successfully sorted using the sort_third function.
