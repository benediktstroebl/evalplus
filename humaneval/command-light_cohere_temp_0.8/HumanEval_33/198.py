The `sort_third` function takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list `l'` where the elements that are divisible by three are sorted to the same values as in `l`, while the elements that are not divisible by three are sorted normally. 
In the tests, the output is correct, and the `assert` statement is true for all inputs.
