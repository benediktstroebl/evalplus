The function 'sort_third' accepts a list 'l' as input and produces a new list 'l' that is a mirror of the input list, except for values that are not of 3, which are sorted to be equal to their corresponding values in the input list, but in ascending order. The function was implemented with the specific input list and tests to ensure its functionality.
