This Python script defines a function called `sort_third` that sorts a list of numbers into a format where values divisible by 3 are grouped together and the remainder is in reverse order. This allows for easy identification and rearrangement of numbers divisible by 3 while keeping the numbers not divisible by 3 in their original order. 

The function uses list comprehension and slicing to achieve this, and the tests cover a range of scenarios to ensure the function works correctly.
