```python
def sort_third(lst):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that the values at positions not divisible by three are moved to the front, while the values at positions divisible by three are left unchanged, and the list is then sorted.

    Args:
        lst (list) : list to be sorted with respect to divisibility by three.

    Returns:
    sorted list l' with respect to the divisibility constraint.
    """

Example:
    >>> l = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third(l)
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> l = [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]
    >>> sort_third(l)
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    """

    # Sort list l with respect to divisibility
    lst = sorted(lst, key=lambda x: not_divisible(x, 3))

    # Define a helper function to check if an element is divisible by 3
    def not_divisible(x, m):
        for i in range(1, m+1):
            if x % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    return lst

Do you have a great question for me, would you like help with anything else?
