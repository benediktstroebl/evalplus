```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted.
    """
    Python list comprehension is the most convenient way to achieve this
    l[:] = [x for x in l if x % 3 == 0]
    l = [x for x in l if x % 3 != 0]
    return l

def test_sort_third():
    l = [1, 2, 3]
    assert sort_third(l) == [1, 2, 3]
    l = [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]
    assert sort_third(l) == [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```
The code defines a function sort_third that sorts a list of numbers such that each value is not divisible by 3, and leaves the other numbers unchanged. The function achieves this result using list comprehension and sorting the list using list(l) and list(l)[ The test_sort_third function tests the sort_third function with two different lists and checks that the function returns the correct sorted list.
