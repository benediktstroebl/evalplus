```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted.
    """First, let's define a variable l': list and assign it the input list to be sorted.
    """Next, let's sort the list items and store them in a variable named sorted_list": list(l)
    sorted_list = sorted(l,key=lambda x: x // 3)
    """Create a new list l' that contains the values of the original list l, but with the values of elements that are divisible by three replaced by their original value, and sorted.
    l':=sorted_list
    l' contains all the values of l, but the values of elements that are divisible by three are replaced by their original value, and are sorted.
```

Here is the test code that checks if the function works correctly:
```python
def test():
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted.
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
