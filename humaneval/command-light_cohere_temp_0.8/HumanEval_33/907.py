```  The Python script defines a function called sort_third that sorts a list lst such that all numbers not divisible by three are at the beginning, and numbers divisible by three are at the end. The function achieves this by sorting the list first without any numbers divisible by three, then sorting the list again with numbers divisible by three to the front, and finally sorting the list again to ensure the integrity of the original order of numbers divisible by three. The wrapper function _divisible checks if a number is divisible by three, returning True if it is and False otherwise. The test function demonstrates the function by passing the same list lst and printing the sorted list, which should have numbers divisible by three sorted in ascending order and all other numbers not divisible by three at the beginning.
