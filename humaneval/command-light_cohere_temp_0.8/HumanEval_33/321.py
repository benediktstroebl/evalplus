The function **`sort_third`** accepts a list **`l`** as input and returns a new list **`l'`, which is a transformation of the original list in which the values of each element that is not divisible by three are left unchanged, while the values of the elements that are divisible by three are equal to the corresponding values in **`l`**, but are sorted. 
This function is intended to be used to sort lists of numbers in such a way that preserves the relative ordering of numbers that are not divisible by three while changing the relative ordering of numbers that are divisible by three.
