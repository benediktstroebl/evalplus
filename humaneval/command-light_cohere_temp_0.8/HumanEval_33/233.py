    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the
    indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are

    l_copy = l.copy()
    Exists.
    # We if all like: l, as it is passed to the function, the function creates a list `l_copy` and assigns it to the variable `l`.
    l_copy = sorted(l_copy,key=lambda x:int(x)//3)
    l = l_copy.copy()
    can be a example
    return l
```
The function creates a copy of the original list, sorts the values that are divisible by three to the values of the corresponding original list indices, and then returns the copy with the values sorted in this way.
