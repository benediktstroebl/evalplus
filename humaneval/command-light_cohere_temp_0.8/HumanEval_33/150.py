```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted.
    
    :return l[:] if not l.__contains__3 else l[:3] + [l[3]]
```
The function first checks if the list contains the number 3 using the __contains__ method. If the list does not contain the if the number, it simply returns the whole list. If it does contain the specific number, the function will slice the list and add the number as the third element in the list.
