This Python function, named **sort_third**, takes a list lst as input and returns a new list lst' with elements sorted in accordance with the specified rule. The function uses a technique of shifting larger elements to front and then moving smaller components to their proper positions. The script is written in a self-contained fashion, making it simple to understand and use.
