This function takes a list of numbers and returns a list of numbers where the values at the indices that are divisible by 3 are replaced with the corresponding values of the original list, and the remaining values are sorted. The function uses the specific logic to identify numbers divisible by 3 and replace them with the corresponding values from the original list. The function then sorts the final list using the sorted() function from the Python standard library.
