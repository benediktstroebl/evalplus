```
The function 'sort_third' takes a list 'l' as input and returns a new list 'l' where the values at indices that are divisible by three are replaced with the values of the corresponding indices of 'l', but the elements are sorted. 
The function is designed to handle lists of any size and type, and it passes all tests so far.
