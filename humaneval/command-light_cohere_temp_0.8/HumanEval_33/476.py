```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """Sorts list l such that values that are not divisible by three are at the front, while the
    values that are divisible by three are in the back.
    return a
    list that retains its original order for everything divisible by 3."""
    # Use 3 as the threshold for divisibility
    l[:)= l[l.index(3):]
    l.sort(key=3)
    return l
``` 
This function uses the list slicing technique to identify the index of 3 in the list and then swaps the list elements with that index with the back to maintain the original order for the elements divisible by 3. The list is returned to be the sorted version of the original list where the elements divisible by 3 maintain their original order and the elements not divisible by 3 are moved to the front.
