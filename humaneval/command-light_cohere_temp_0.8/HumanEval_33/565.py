# List with large numbers
assert sort_third([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# Lists with duplicate elements

```
The function `sort_third` sorts a list by comparing the integer value of each element to its floor division by 3. It returns the the certain test scenarios by providing a list of elements with various values and types.
