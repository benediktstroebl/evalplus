This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a sorted list `l'` such that each value that is divisible by three will maintain its relative order. The script also defines a test function `test_sort_third` that passes a list with a range of values and a specific expected output to the `sort_third` function and asserts that the output is correct, thus testing the correctness of the function.
