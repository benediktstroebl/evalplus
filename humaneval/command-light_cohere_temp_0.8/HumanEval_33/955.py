    l = sorted(l, key=lambda x: x[0] // 3)
    return l
```  This Python code defines a function named `sort_third` that takes a list l as input and returns a list l' after sorting the elements of list l such that the values at indices that are divisible by three are left unchanged, while the values at indices that are not divisible by three are sorted in ascending order. The code achieves this desired sorting by using the `sorted` function with a custom sorting key lambda function. The lambda function selects the the values of list elements that are divisible by three, and these elements are left unchanged in `l`. 

The code also provides several test cases to verify the correctness of the `sort_third` function.
