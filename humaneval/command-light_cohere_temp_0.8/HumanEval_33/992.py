```

This Python function named sort_third takes a list l as an argument and returns a modified list l'. The function aims to sort the list such that values at the indices that are divisible by three are replaced with the corresponding values from l, while keeping other values identical. The function also maintains the stability of the sorting algorithm, which means that equal values will stay in the same order as they were in the original list.
