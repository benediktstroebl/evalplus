This code defines a function **sort_third** which sorts a list such that the values not divisible by three are left unchanged, while the values divisible by three are equal to each other but sorted. The test_sort_third function tests whether the sort_third function correctly by comparing the expected results with the output of the sort_third function applied to a set of test cases.
