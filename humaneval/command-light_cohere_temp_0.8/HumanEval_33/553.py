```python
def sort_third(lst):
    # Sort list while keeping track of third-indexed values.
    return [ original_third = [item for item in lst ][:3]
    lst[:] = sorted([item for item in lst if item != original_third[item]]) + [original_third]
    lst.lst third = [ original_third + original_third.copy
    necessary to make the
    list comprehension and list slicing. 
```
This Python script defines a function named `sort_third` that takes a list `lst` as an argument. The function sorts the list while keeping track of the third-indexed values and returns the original list with modified values.
