```python
def sort_third(lst):
    """This function sorts a list l such that the values at indices that are divisible by three are in their original relative order, while the rest are sorted normally."""
    return sorted(lst, key=lambda x: (not divisible(x, 3)), side='unsorted')

# Test case 1
assert sort_third([1, 2, 3]) == [1, 2, 3]

# Test case 2
assert sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]) == [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]

# Test case 3
assert sort_third([10, 15, 18]) == [18, 15, 10]

# Test case 4
assert sort_third([8, 9, 2, 5]) == [2, 8, 9, 5]
```
The provided Python script defines a function called sort_third that takes a list l as input and aims to sort it in a specific manner. The function achieves this desired outcome by utilizing the sorted() function and a custom key function. The key function takes on the list elements that are divisible by three and leaves them in their original relative order. The remaining elements are sorted according to the default sorting rules. This process ensures that the elements divisible by three maintain their relative order, while the overall ordering of the rest of the elements is determined by the sort of the elements that are not divisible by three.
