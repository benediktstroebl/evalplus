    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Correctly handling edge cases such as zero-length lists or lists with only divisible numbers is crucial. It would be best to raise a specific exception, such as a ValueError or AssertionError, rather than crashing the program with a general error like ZeroDivisionError.

Therefore, we should add proper exception handling to the code.
