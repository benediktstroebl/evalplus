    other indicies are equal to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted.

    return sorted(lst)[::3]

# Example usage:
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3])) #Expected output: [3, 2, 1]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])) #Expected output: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```
This script defines a function named sort_third that takes a list lst as input and returns a new list l' such that the elements at positions not divisible by three in lst are copied to l'. The elements at positions divisible by three in lst are equal to the corresponding elements in lst, but are sorted.
