```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted.
    """
    list comprehension is [i for i in l if i % 3 != 0]
    return [x for x in l if i not in set(l[sort_third([l])]) and i < 3]
```
This script defines a function sort_third that takes a list l and returns a new list l'. The function filters out elements from list l that are divisible by three, and keeps the other elements as they are in the original list.
