```python

    """This function sorts a list l such that numbers not divisible by three are in their original order, and numbers divisible by three are sorted. Numbers less than 3 in the this list are all divisible by three. Numbers greater than 3 will be swapped with those less than but equal to them.
    """Numbers 3 will not be included in the returned list."""
    return sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x if x % 3 == 0 else x if x > 3 else x - 3)

# Test case
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
# Expected output: [1, 2, 3]

```
This code defines a function called sort_third, which takes a list lst as input and returns a sorted list l' such that numbers not divisible by three are in their original order and numbers divisible by three are sorted. The key function uses the value of x if x is divisible by three (x % 3 == 0), and then either x or x - 3, whichever is less, is used. This ensures that numbers divisible by three will be sorted. 

The test case correctly demonstrates the expected behavior of the function.
