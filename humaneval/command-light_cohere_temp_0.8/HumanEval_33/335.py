```python

    return [x for x in l if x % 3 == 0] + [x for x in l if x % 3 != 0]

```

This script defines a Python function named sort_third, which is designed to sort a list l such that the elements that are not divisible by three appear first, while the elements divisible by three are sorted as they appear in the original list. The function achieves this desired output by utilizing list comprehension with conditional statements.
