    Args:

```
This Python function, sort_third, takes a list l as an argument and returns a list l'. The function performs two main operations:
1. Copying the list values to a new list, lst[::3]: This line creates a new list lst and assigns the first three elements of the original list l to the first three positions of the new list. Then, it creates a new list lst that is identical to l in the items that are not divisible by three.
2. Sorting the lst: The line sorts the new list lst in ascending order using the sorted() function. This results in a list l that has the first three elements of l at the start and the remaining elements in ascending order.

By using these two steps, the function effectively removes the third elements from the list that are divisible by three and sorts the remaining elements in ascending order.

This function can be used to prepend the first third of any list to the original list, effectively sorting the list in a way that preserves the first third of the elements.

Note that this function is self-contained, meaning it doesn't require any external functions or variables to be used. The function is designed to solve the problem of sorting the third elements of a list in a specific way.
