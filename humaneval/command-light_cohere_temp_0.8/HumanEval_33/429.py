The provided Python script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a sorted list `l`' such that all values divisible by three appear first, and all other values are in their correct relative order. The `sort_third` function uses list comprehension and the `sort` function to achieve this. 

The script also provides two unit tests for the `sort_third` function: it creates lists with values divisible by three first and with other values, respectively, and passes them to the `sort_third` function. The expected output for these test lists is that the values divisible by three appear first, followed by the other values in their correct relative order.
