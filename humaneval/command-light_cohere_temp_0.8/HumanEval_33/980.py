```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the third indic value, while its values at the other indic values are equal to the values of the corresponding indic value, but sorted.

    Test Case the real list comprehension and the other cases.
def test_sort_third(test_list):
    assert sort_third([1, 2, 3]) == [1, 2, 3], "incorrect output"
    assert sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]) == [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5], "incorrect output"
    assert sort_third([10, 2, 3, 1, 4]) == [10, 2, 3, 1, 4], "incorrect output"

```
This Python script defines a function test_sort_third that takes a list and performs the third element sorting on it. The function then passes these tests to ensure the output is correct for different input lists.
