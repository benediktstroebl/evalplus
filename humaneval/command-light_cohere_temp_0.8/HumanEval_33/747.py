```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted.
    """
    function uses a time by sorting the list l using the sort function.
    return sorted(l)
```

This function takes a list l and returns a new list l', which is identical to l in terms of the elements that are not divisible by three. The function then returns a sorted list of all the elements in l, such that the elements that are divisible by three are equal to the elements of l, but sorted. The function then uses the Python's built-in sort function.
