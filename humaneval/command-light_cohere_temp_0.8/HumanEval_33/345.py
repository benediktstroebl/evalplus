This Python script defines a self-contained function named `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list `l'` that satisfies a specific sorting criterion. The function first sorts the particular elements of the list `l` that are not divisible by three, and then it sorts the remaining elements of `l` to have values equal to the corresponding elements of `l`, but with a different sorting order. The final result is a list `l` is identical to `l` in the indices that are not divisible by three, and the values of the corresponding indices of `l` are equal to the values of the corresponding indices of `l`, but with a different sorting order. 

This function effectively handles the problem of sorting elements in a list that are not divisible by three while preserving equal values for corresponding elements that are divisible by three.
