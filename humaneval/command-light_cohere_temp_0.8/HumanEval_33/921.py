```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted.

    Test cases the class the test on a list of numbers and strings that contain numbers.

    Test that the test passes with the following test cases:
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    >>> sort_third([11, 22, 33, 55, 77, 11, 33, 55, 22, 77])
    [11, 22, 33, 55, 77, 11, 33, 55, 77]
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: 'int' object does not support item assignment  

    Test with strings:
    >>> sort_third('abc')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    TypeError: 'int' object does not support item assignment  

    Test with floats:
    >>> sort_third(3.14)
   
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    TypeError: 'int' object does not support item assignment  

    Test with empty list:
    >>> sort_third([])
    []

    Test with list of integers:
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    Test with list of floats:
    >>> sort_third([3.14, 2.3, 1])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    TypeError: 'int' object does not support item assignment  

    Test with list of complex numbers:
    >>> sort_third([1+1j, 2+2j, 3+3j])
    [1, 2, 3]
    """
l = [1, 2, 3]
l.sort_third(l)
print(l)

This Python script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and modifies it such that the values of elements at indices that are divisible by three are left unchanged, while the corresponding elements at indices that are not divisible by three are assigned the same value as the corresponding element in `l`, but are sorted. 

The function then performs tests to ensure its functionality, including passing tests with various types of input data, including integers, strings, floats, and complex numbers. 

The script then demonstrates the use of the function by sorting a list of integers and printing the sorted list.
