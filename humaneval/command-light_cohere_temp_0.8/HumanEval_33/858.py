```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted."""

    l = [1, 2, 3]
    assert sort_third(l) == [1, 2, 3], "sorted failed"
    l = [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]
    assert sort_third(l) == [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5], "sorted failed"
    # your tests here go here...
```
This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list and returns a sorted list in which the values at indices that are divisible by 3 are left unchanged, while the rest are sorted. The test suite provides assertions to check the function's correctness.
