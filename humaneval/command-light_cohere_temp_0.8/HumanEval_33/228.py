This script defines a function `sort_third` that sorts a list so that the values at indices that are not divisible by three are in their correct positions. The function takes a list as input and returns a new list that has been sorted in accordance with this principle. 

This function is self-contained, meaning it does not require any external functions or classes to be called, and it can be used directly on any list to achieve the desired result. 

This function solves the problem and passes all the corresponding tests, making it a complete solution.
