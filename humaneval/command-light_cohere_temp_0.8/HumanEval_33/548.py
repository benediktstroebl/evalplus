This script defines a function `sort_third` that sorts a list in a manner such that all values divisible by three appear in their correct relative order. The function takes a list `l` as an argument and returns a new list `l'`, which is the sorted version of `l`. 

The function uses list comprehension to create a new list `l` that is initially identical to the input list `l`. Then, it iterates through the original list `l` using a for loop. Inside the loop, it checks if the current value `l[i]` is divisible by three using the condition `l[i] % 3 == 0`. If the condition is true, it swaps the values at indices `i` and `len(l) - i - 1` using a tuple assignment. 

This process effectively moves values that are divisible by three to the front of the list, while keeping other values in their original relative order. 

The final sorted list `l` is returned. 

This function provides a simple and efficient way to sort a list such that all values divisible by three appear correctly relative to each other, while preserving the original order of other values. 

You can use this function to sort lists in Markdown documents, and other text files, by passing the list as an argument to the function.
