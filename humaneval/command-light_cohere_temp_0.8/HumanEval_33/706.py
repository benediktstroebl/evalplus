    list comprehension with set_ of integers to be divisible by 3 is used to filter out the values that are not divisible by three. The values that list comprehension is then used to create a new list that contains only the values from l that are divisible by three.

 This function then takes this new list and returns a list that is identical to l but with the values at the indic that are divisible by three sorted.
