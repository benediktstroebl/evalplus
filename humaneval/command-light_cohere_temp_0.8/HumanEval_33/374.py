This Python script provides a self-contained function called sort_third, designed to sort a list l such that the elements not divisible by three are positioned at the beginning, and their corresponding values are equal at the next positions. The function achieves this desired order by first sorting the list and then defining a helper function not_divisible that checks if an element x is divisible by three. The function then returns the results in the list l having the desired structure. The script also includes three test cases that demonstrate the function's behavior and correctness.
