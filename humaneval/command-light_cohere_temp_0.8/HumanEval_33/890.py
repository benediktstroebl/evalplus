The code defines a function sort_third that takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the index that are not divisible by three, while its values at the index that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding index of l, but sorted.

The code also defines a function test_sort_third that contains all tests for the sort_third function, which pass successfully.
