This Python script defines a function called sort_third, which takes a list l as input and returns a new list l'. The function identifies the elements in l that are divisible by 3 and swaps them with the corresponding elements from the original list, while leaving other elements unchanged. The function also raises an AssertionError if the input list is empty.

The script provides several test cases to verify the functionality of the sort_third function. The test cases include lists with various elements and the expected output when the function is applied. The script also includes an assertion to check if the actual output matches the expected output for each test case. 

The output of running this script with the test cases will be a message displaying whether the test cases passed or failed, along with details about the actual and expected outputs.
