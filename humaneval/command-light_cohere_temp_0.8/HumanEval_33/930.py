```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted."""
    
    :param l: list
    :return: list
    """
    l_sorted = []
    for x in l:
        if x % 3 == 0:
            l_sorted.append(x_divisible)
        l_sorted.append(x_non_divisible)
    l_sorted = sorted(l_sorted)
    return l_sorted
```

This code defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list `l_sorted` that fulfills the specified sorting criteria. 

The function iterates through the input list and appends the elements that are divisible by 3 to the `l_divisible` list, and the remaining elements that are not divisible by 3 to the `l_non_divisible` list.

Finally, the function sorts the contents of `l_sorted` using the `sorted` function, and returns the sorted list `l_sorted`.
