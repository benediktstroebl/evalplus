# Create a list

This Python script defines a function named sort_third that sorts a list of numbers into a new list. The function takes a list as its parameter and uses the sorted() function to sort the list. The sorted list is then filtered to only include numbers that are not divisible by three. The function then returns a list of numbers that are divisible by three.

The example usage creates a list and calls the sort_third function with the list as an argument. The function then returns a list of numbers that are not divisible by three. The output is then printed to the console.

The function is designed to be self-contained, meaning that it does not rely on any other functions or modules to work. The function is also designed to be efficient, meaning that it will run in a reasonable amount of time. The function is also designed to be easy to use, meaning that it will be easy to call and will return a list of numbers that are not divisible by three.
