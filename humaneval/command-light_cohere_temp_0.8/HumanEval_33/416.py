This Python function, `sort_third`, takes a list `lst` as an argument and sorts it in a way that values divisible by three appear first, and values that are not divisible by three remain in their original order. The function uses the all elements of the list as numbers and passes them to the `sorted` function, which sorts the numbers in ascending order. The `key` argument of the `sorted` function is a lambda function that takes an element `x` of the list as an argument and returns the remainder when dividing `x` by 3, which is 0 for values divisible by 3 and 3 for values not divisible by three. 

The function then returns the sorted list. The test cases pass without errors and the expected outputs are as expected.
