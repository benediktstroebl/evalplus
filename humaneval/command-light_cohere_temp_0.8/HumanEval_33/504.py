```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted.
    """

    list comprehension, a filtering approach, is faster than using a loop.
    l[i] % 3 == 0
    if i in [0, 1, 3]:
        l[i] = l[i] + l[i-3]
    return l

# Test the function with an example
test_list = [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]
print("Test list:", test_list)
print("Sorted list:", sort_third(test_list))
