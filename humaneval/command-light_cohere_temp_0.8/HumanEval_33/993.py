```
The function `sort_third` is self-contained and solves the problem of sorting a list such that the values not divisible by three remain in their original order, and the values divisible by three are sorted. The function uses the filtering numbers divisible by three and placing them in their correct positions using tuple unpacking. The example usage demonstrates how the script can be used to sort a list and pass corresponding tests.
