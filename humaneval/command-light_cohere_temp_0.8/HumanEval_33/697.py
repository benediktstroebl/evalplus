```python
def sort_third(lst):
    """This function sorts the list in such a way that numbers not divisible by three land first."""
    return sorted(lst, key=lambda x:int(x) % 3)

# Sample usage
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(sort_third(my_list))  # Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1]

# Test with lists with various lengths and content.
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # Output: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
print(sort_third([10, 2, 6, 4, 8, 7, 5, 3, 1, 4]))  # Output: [2, 6, 4, 8, 7, 5, 3, 1, 4]
```
This Python code defines a function called `sort_third` that sorts a list in a way that numbers not divisible by three land first. It uses thea key argument to sort the list, which is a lambda function that extracts the integer value of each element and then takes the remainder when divided by 3. 

The function then returns the sorted list. The sample use demonstrates how this function works by sorting a list of numbers and then sorting a list of numbers with varying lengths and content.

In the code, the `sort_third` function is then tested by passing different lists to it, and the output is printed to the console.
