This Python code defines a function sort_third that takes a list l as input and returns a sorted list l' such that the values at indices that are divisible by 3 are equal to the values of the corresponding elements of the original list, but the overall ordering remains. The function sort_by_third is also defined, which takes a list lst of numbers and returns a sorted list lst' such that the values of the elements at indices that are divisible by 3 are equal to the values of the corresponding elements of lst, but the sorting is based on the first three values of each element.
