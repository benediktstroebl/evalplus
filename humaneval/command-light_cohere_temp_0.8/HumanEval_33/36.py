```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l
    in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted.
    """Example usage:```
>>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
[1, 2, 3]
>>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```
The above code defines a Python function called sort_third that takes a list l as input and returns a list l' which is a sorted list of numbers in such a way that they are either divisible by three or not. The function works by first creating a list of numbers that are divisible by three, then creating a new list of numbers that are equal to the corresponding numbers in the original list, but sorted in ascending order. Finally, the function returns the for the list l' as a sorted list of numbers that are either divisible by three or not.
