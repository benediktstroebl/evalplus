```
The code defines a function sort_third that sorts an input list lst such that all the elements not divisible by three will stay in their original order, while the elements divisible by three will be added to the start of the list and in the original order. The code also tests this tested the by applying the function to a sample input list [1, 2, 3] and prints the expected output, which is [1, 2, 3].
