```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted."""
    l = [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]
    return [x if (x%3 == 0) else y for x, y for x, y in zip(l, l[1:])]

# Test the function with a list
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```
The script defines a function **sort_third** that takes a list as an argument and returns a new list with elements from the original list that are not divisible by three sorted in ascending order, and elements that are divisible by three are sorted to be equal to each other but remain in their original order. 

It then prints the sorted list for the test cases.
