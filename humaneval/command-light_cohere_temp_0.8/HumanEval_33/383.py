```  The `sort_third` function sorts the list l according to the third value. The `l_even` list is created by filtering out the elements in l that are divisible by 3, and the `l_odd` list is created by filtering out the elements in l that are not divisible by 3. The `l_odd` list is then sorted using the `sort` function, and the `l_even` list is created by appending the sorted `l_odd` list to the `l_even` list. The sorted `l_odd` list is then appended to the `l_even` list, and the `l_even` list is returned.
