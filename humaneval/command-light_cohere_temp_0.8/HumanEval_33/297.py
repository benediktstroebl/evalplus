```python
def sort_third(lst):
    """Returns a list l' such that all items in lst are identical to its
    corresponding item in lst, except for items that are divisible
    by 3, in which case the value is replaced by the value of the
    corresponding item in the sorted list."""

    lst[::3] = lst[::3].copy()  # Copy all items except the last value of each
    list at index ::3
    l = list(map(list, lst))
    l.sort_by_key()
    key = lambda x: x[::3]
    l.sort_by_key()
    new_lst = []
    for x in l:
        new_lst.append(x[x[::3] if isinstance(x, int) else x])
    return new_lst

# Example usage
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
 ```

This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list as input and returns a new list where all items are identical to their corresponding item in the original list, except for items divisible by 3, which are replaced with the value of the corresponding item in the sorted list.
