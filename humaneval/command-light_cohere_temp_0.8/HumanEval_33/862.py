This Python script defines a self-contained function that solves the problem of sorting lists of numbers into a format where numbers divisible by three are replaced with their original value, while numbers not divisible by three are sorted normally. The function also includes a function to determine whether an element is divisible by three, and a helper function to split a string into a list of strings.
