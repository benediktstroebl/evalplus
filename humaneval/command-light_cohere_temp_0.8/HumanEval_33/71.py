In this Python script, we have a function called **sort_third** that takes a list as an argument and sorts it such that the values at the indices that are not divisible by three are in the list's beginning, and the other values are sorted normally. The function uses the **sorted** function from the built-in Python library to sort the list and the **key** parameter is a lambda function that returns a Boolean value indicating whether a value is divisible by three or not.

The test cases demonstrate that the function works as expected, sorting the list according to the specified criteria. The test cases can be modified to include a wider range of inputs and produce the expected results.
