This Python script defines a function `sort_third` that sorts a list according to the "third" rule. It employs Python's this syntax, which is a standalone Python program enclosed in a single line. 

The function `sort_third` takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list `l'` where the values at indices that are not divisible by three are the same as the corresponding values in `l`, but are sorted. 
The function is designed to pass all tests related to this sorting rule.
