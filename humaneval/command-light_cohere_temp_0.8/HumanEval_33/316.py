```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted."""

```  The provided Python script defines a function sort_third that takes a list l and returns a new list l', which is the list's elements that are not divisible by three, sorted in ascending order. The function achieves this by using a list comprehension and checks if the current element is not divisible by three. The second list comprehension checks if the current element is divisible by three and assigns it to the new list, while the first one assigns the non-divisible elements to the new list. The test_sort_third function tests the correctness of the sort_third function by passing a sample list to it and checking if the returned list is the expected result.
