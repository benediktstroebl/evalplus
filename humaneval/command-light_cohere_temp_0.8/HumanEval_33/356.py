This Python script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a list `l_copy` where values at indices that are divisible by three are replaced with the values of the corresponding index in `l`. The function then creates a copy of the list `l_copy` using the `copy()` method and sorts the elements of `l_copy` differently than the elements of `l`. This script is considered self-contained because it includes a complete function with a clear purpose and explanation, and it does not rely on any other functions or modules.
