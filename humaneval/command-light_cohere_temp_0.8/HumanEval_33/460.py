This Python script defines a function `sort_third` that sorts a list in a way that is guaranteed not to change lists of odd lengths, such as lists containing powers of 2. The `test_sort_third` function is then used to test the `sort_third` function with various test cases, including lists of numbers and objects of various data types.
