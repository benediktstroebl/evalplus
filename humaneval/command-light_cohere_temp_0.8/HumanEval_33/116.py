```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the 
    third, while values divisible by three are sorted.
    
    :

    elements divisible by three from the list l.

``` 
This code defines a Python function named `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as an argument and returns a new list `l'` that sorts the elements in `l` that are not divisible by three, while leaving the other elements unchanged. The function uses list comprehension and the list's built-in `sorted` function to perform the desired sorting operation.
