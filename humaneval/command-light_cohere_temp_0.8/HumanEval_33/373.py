```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted."""

    #map
    mapp = {i: i for i in l if i % 3 == 0}
    l = [x for x in l if x not in mapp] + [x for x in l if x in mapp]
    l.sort()

    all in the region of the list is divisible by three, the values of those indices will be equal, but we want them to be sorted.
    return l

``` 
This Python code defines a function named `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list `l'` with elements from the original list that are either not divisible by three or equal to corresponding elements from the original list but sorted. 
Testing the code's effectiveness by passing a sample list to the `sort_third` function and comparing the returned list with the original list.
