The function `sort_third` takes a list `l` and returns a new list `l'` which has elements equal to the corresponding elements in `l` that are divisible by three, while the other elements are sorted. The function is tested by passing the test cases and demonstrating that the returned list `l'` is indeed sorted according to the criteria set out in the function.
