```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l
    in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted."""
    return [3 for i in l if i % 3 == 0] + [i for i in l if i % 3 != 0]
```
The code defines a function `sort_third` that sorts a list `l` such that the elements not divisible by 3 are moved to the front, and the other elements are moved to the back.

It uses list comprehension to achieve this: it creates a new list `l'` by concatenating two lists: the list of numbers divisible by 3 and the list of numbers not divisible by 3. The function returns this new list.
