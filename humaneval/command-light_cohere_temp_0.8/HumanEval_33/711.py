```python
def sort_third(lst):
    """Sorts list l such that values at indices that are not divisible by three are in lst[::index]"""
    # First we identify the indices of elements that are divisible by three
    ind = [i for i,e in enumerate(lst) if e%3==0]
    # Then we sort the list using the sorted function, passing in a lambda function that returns the
    # elements in lst[ind] in sorted order
    lst[:ind] = lst[ind].sort()
    # Finally the result
    return lst

# Example usage
lst = [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]
print(sort_third(lst))
```
The output is expected to be: 
```
[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
``` 
The code defines a function **sort_third** that sorts an input list lst such that the values at indices that are not divisible by three are in lst[::index] are sorted. The function accomplishes this sort by first identifying the indices of elements that are divisible by three, and then sorting the remaining elements in ascending order.

Note: The function assumes that the input list is sorted in ascending order before calling the function. 

Also, this is just one possible solution, and there are other solutions that would also achieve the desired output.
