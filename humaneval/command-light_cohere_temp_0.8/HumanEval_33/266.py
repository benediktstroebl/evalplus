This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list as input and returns a sorted list. The function uses the first moves all values that are divisible by three to the front of the list. The second moves the values that are divisible by three to the back of the list, and the remaining values are the same as the corresponding value in the input list. 

The script then provides an example list to test the function, and passes it to the `sort_third` function. It then prints the value of the returned list `lst2` to the console.

Finally, the script tests if the values in the list `lst` are in the correct order by comparing the `lst` and `lst2` lists. If they are the and there is a mismatch, it prints an error message.
