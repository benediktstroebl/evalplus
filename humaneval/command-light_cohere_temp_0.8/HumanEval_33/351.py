```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the index that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding index of l, but sorted.
    """
    list l' is a list of integers taken from 1 to n, and is sorted using the sort() function.
    l' is index that is divisible by three is identified using the floor function, which returns the largest integer less than or equal to the index that is divisible by three, while the index that is not divisible by three is identified using the modulo function, which returns the largest integer less than or equal to the index that is not divisible by three.
    """
    example is as follows:
    ```python
    >>> l = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third(l)
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> l = [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]
    >>> sort_third(l)
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    ```
The script defines a function `sort_third` that sorts a list of integers in a way that is similar to the previous code you provided. The function takes a array `l` as input and returns a sorted list `l' that is identical to the input list in the indices that are not divisible by three. The function uses the array `l` to define two arrays: `l` and `l_floor`, which contain the same elements as `l` but have different indices that are divisible by and not divisible by three, respectively. The function then sorts the array `l` using the built-in Python function `sort()` and returns the sorted array `l`.
