This Python script defines a self-contained function called `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list `l'` where elements divisible by three are left unchanged, and the rest are sorted. The `sort_third` function is designed to pass all tests for the problem, including input validation and comparison to a reference sorted list. The `is_permutation` and `map` functions are used to test the `sort_third` function with various inputs, ensuring that it behaves correctly. The script also includes a `test_is_permutation` function, which takes two integers `n` and `m` as input and returns a boolean value based on whether there is a permutation of `m` in the range from 0 to `n`. The final `test_sort_third` function is used to test the `sort_third` function with a list of integers. 

The script then includes an example usage of the `sort_third` function with two test cases: when the function is invoked with a list of integers, it prints out whether the list is a permutation of [1, 2, 3]. The Overall results of the tests should be correct, indicating that the `sort_
