```python
def sort_third(lst):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted.

    Test cases on the ideal inputs and expected outputs.

    lst = [ [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]
    assert len(sort_third(lst)) == 6
    assert sorted(sort_third(lst)) == [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    assert sort_third([1, 2, 3]) == [1, 2, 3]

```
This code defines a function called `sort_third` that sorts a list of numbers into the positions where the numbers are not divisible by three. It does this tests expected inputs and provides the corresponding outputs, including the correct number of items in the output list and the list's correct order.
