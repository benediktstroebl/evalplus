```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the third index, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted."""
    l = [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]
    return [x for x in l if x % 3 != 0 else sorted([x for x in l]) + [x for x in l if x % 3 == 0]]
```
The provided function is designed to sort a list in a specific manner, ensuring that the values at the third index are kept intact. It uses a time to check whether an element is divisible by three, and if so, it assigns the element to the correct position in the sorted list. The function also handles cases where the elements are not divisible by three.
