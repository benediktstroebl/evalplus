```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted.
    """ 
    Args:
        l (list) : input list
    Returns:
        l' (list) : sorted list
    """
    l_copy = list(l)
    is_divisible = [False] * len(l_copy)
    l_copy[is_divisible[i]] = l_copy[is_divisible[i]] + 1
    l = l_copy
    return l

# Test the function
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3])) # [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])) # [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```
The provided Python script defines a function `sort_third` that sorts a list of numbers such that the values at indices that are divisible by three will remain unchanged, while values at indices that are not divisible will be incremented by one. The function works by creating a identical copy of the input list and then modifying the values at indices that are divisible by three in the copy list. The modified copy list is then sorted according to this logic and returned as the output.
