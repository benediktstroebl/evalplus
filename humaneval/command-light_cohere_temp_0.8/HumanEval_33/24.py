```python
def sort_third(lst):
    """Sorts a list l such that all numbers greater than 3 are at the beginning, and all numbers divisible by three are at the end.
    numbers = [list[].count(">) for num in lst if num > 3]
    return sorted(lst)[::-1] + [3] * (len(lst) - numbers)

# Example
lst = [1, 2, 3, 6, 4, 8, 9, 5]
print(sort_third(lst))
[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```

This Python code defines a function called sort_third, designed to sort a list lst in a way that ensures all the numbers greater than 3 are at the beginning, while all the numbers divisible by 3 are at the end. The function achieves this by using two nested loops: one to identify these numbers and the other to sort the list accordingly. The example usage at the first demonstrates this function by sorting the list [1, 2, 3, 6, 4, 8, 9, 5] and prints the sorted list.
