    l = [1, 2, 3]
    l.append(6)
    sort(l, key=lambda x: (x % 3 == 0), lst=[1, 2, 3]))

```  The provided Python script defines a function called sort_third, which takes a list l as input and returns a new list l' that meets specific criteria related to the list elements. The criteria are that all elements in l that are not divisible by three are kept unchanged, while the values of elements divisible by three are set equal to the corresponding elements in l but are also sorted. The sorting is done using the specified sorting method. Finally, the function is tested with two different lists, and the output is printed to verify the expected behavior.
