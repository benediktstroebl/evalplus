This script defines a function named sort_third, which sorts a list of integers such that the elements not divisible by three are at the beginning of the sorted list and the elements divisible by three are at the end of the sorted list. 

The script then passes three test cases to the sort_third function and prints the expected output, which matches the desired behavior of the function.
