The provided Python script defines a function sort_third that takes a list l as input and aims to rearrange its elements such that numbers divisible by three appear at the end. The function achieves this original list's elements by moving those that are divisible by three to the end. It ensures that the original list's elements are still present and the numbers divisible by three are in their original order. The function finally returns the test_sort_third() with a sample list to verify its correctness.
