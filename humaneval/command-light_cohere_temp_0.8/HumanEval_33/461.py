```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted.
    Input:
    l (list) -> list of numbers or other elements
    Output:
    l' (list) -> list of numbers or other elements, possibly not sorted
    """
    l_divisible = [x for x in l if x % 3 == 0]
    l_sorted = sorted(l_divisible)
    l_copy = l[:]
    l_copy.append(l_sorted)
    l_copy = list(set(l_copy))
    return l_copy
```

The function takes a list `l` and creates a new list `l_copy` that contains the same elements as `l` but sorted. The function then creates a new list `l_sorted` by sorting the elements in `l_divisible` (which are the elements in `l` that are divisible by 3). The function then appends the `l_sorted` elements to `l_copy` to create a new list `l_copy` that contains all the elements of `l` that are not divisible by 3. The function then converts `l_copy` back to a list `l` and returns it.
