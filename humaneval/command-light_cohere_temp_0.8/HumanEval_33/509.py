# Tests
def test_sort_third():
    l = [10, 1, 2, 20, 30]
    assert sort_third(l) == [20, 30, 1, 2, 10]

def test_sort_third_empty():

```

The script defines a function `sort_third` which sorts a list based on whether each element is divisible by three or not. It then has three test functions to verify the functionality of the `sort_third` function with various input lists.
