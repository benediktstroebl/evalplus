```python
def sort_third(lst):
    """Sorts the list l according to the rule that numbers not divisible by three stay as they are, while numbers divisible by three are moved to the front of their original position. Numbers that are divisible by three are treated as the values of their corresponding numbers, and sorted.
    Args:
        lst (list)
    Returns:
        list, sorted list according to the above rule

    new_lst = []
    for num in lst:
        if num % 3 == 0:
            new_lst.append(num)
   
    new_lst.append(num)
   
    return new_lst
```  This function takes a list of numbers and returns a new list where numbers that are divisible by three are moved to the front of the list, and the numbers that are not divisible by three are left unchanged. The function then sorts the expected output for the given list of numbers.
