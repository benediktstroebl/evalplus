This script defines two functions, sort_third and sort_mod_three, which respectively sort a list so that elements which are not divisible by 3 and elements which are divisible by 3 maintain their relative order while elements which are not divisible by 3 are sorted.  The resulting lists contain the sorted elements, as intended.
