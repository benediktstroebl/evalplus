```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted.

    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]

    [2, 6, 3, 4, 9, 5, 10]
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<string>", line 3, in <module>
    ValueError: cannot convert '7' to integer()
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 9, 5, 8, 10]
    """
    l = list(map(int, l))
    return sorted(l[::range(len(l))]) + l[:::range(len(l))])
``` 
The function uses the map() function to convert the list elements to integers, then sorts the list using the sorted() function, and finally concatenates the sorted list and the original list to return the solution.
