This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `lst` as an argument. It sorts the most list so that the values divisible by three are in their correct positions, while the rest are left untouched. The list is then split into two lists: one with elements divisible by three and the other with other elements. The function then returns the element-wise mapping of the two lists, effectively sorting the list.

The test cases demonstrate the functionality of the function, passing the test successfully.
