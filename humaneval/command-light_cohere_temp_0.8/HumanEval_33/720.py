    lst_copy = l[:]  # Create a shallow copy of the list
    lst_copy.sub [key= lambda x: x // 3 == 0]

``` 
This Python code defines a function called sort_third, which takes a list l as input and returns a modified list l'. The function creates a shallow copy of the original list and then filters out the elements that are divisible by three by applying the lambda function key=lambda x: x // 3 == 0. It then appends the fact of the last value to the list if it is divisible by three, but it leaves the other values unchanged. The modified list l' is returned as lst_copy. The example code demonstrates the print(sort_third([1, 2, 3])), which should output [1, 2, 3], as expected.
