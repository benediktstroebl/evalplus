```  The function `sort_third` sorts a list `l` such that elements that are not divisible by three are in the same relative position as in `l`, but the values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding index in `l`, but are sorted. 
The test suite passes successfully for the given inputs, because the function `sort_third` correctly sorts the list in a way that preserves relative relationships between non-divisible and divisible elements.
