# Test case 2
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]

```
This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list as an argument. The function first sorts the primary elements, then, it takes the remainder of elements after dividing them by 3 and sorts them, creating the final sorted list. The tests showcase that function works as expected, sorting the list correctly according to the specified logic.
