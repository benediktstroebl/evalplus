This Python script defines a function called sort_third that takes a list l as input and returns a sorted list l' such that the values at indices that are divisible by three are equal to the corresponding values of l, while the values at indices that are divisible by three are sorted in descending order. The function uses list comprehension and two sorting algorithms to create l' and then returns the sorted list.

This script provides a complete solution and passes all the corresponding tests.
