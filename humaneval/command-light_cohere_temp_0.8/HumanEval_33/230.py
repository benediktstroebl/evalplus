    Python list comprehension and list l[:3]

def test():
    lst = [1, 2, 3, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]
    assert sort_third(lst) == [2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5], "Failed to sort"

# Test the function
test()
```
The function **sort_third** sorts the list **l** so that values at indices that are divisible by 3 are the same and the values at the remaining indices are sorted.  The function uses Python list comprehension to filter out the first three elements of the list and then uses the built-in function **sorted** to sort the remaining elements.  The function also uses assertion to test its own correctness.
