```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the
    first three values, while its values at the index 4 and beyond are equal to the values of the corresponding index of l, but sorted."""

    # we need to use a list comprehension to create a new list that only contains the first three values of l[0:3]
    l1 = [x for x in l[0:3]]

    # we need to create a new list that only has the remaining elements of l, but in sorted order
    l2 = sorted([x for x in l[3:]])

    # we need to append the results of l1 and l2 to l
    return l1 + l2
