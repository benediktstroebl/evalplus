This script defines a function named `sort_third` that sorts a list `lst` in such a way that elements divisible by three appear in their correct positions. The function uses list comprehension to filter out these elements and then sorts the remaining elements without regard to divisibility by three. 

This function could be useful in various applications that require sorting lists while maintaining certain properties.
