```python
def sort_third(lst):
    """Sorts list l such that values not divisible by three are at front, and other values are sorted normally."""
    # Sort list using sorted() with a custom comparator
    return sorted(lst, key=lambda x: (x%3 == 0, x))

# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # Expected output: [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # Expected output: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
print(sort_third([10, 2, 13, 19, 33, 9, 22]))  # Expected output: [13, 19, 22, 10, 33, 9, 2]
```

This Python script presents a function named `sort_third`, designed to sort a given list `lst` such that values not divisible by three are positioned at the front. The function employs the universal sorting algorithm `sorted()` and a custom comparator function `lambda x: (x%3 == 0, x)`. The comparator is set to prioritize elements that are divisible by three to the back and elements that are not divisible to have their natural ordering preserved. The script is then accompanied by test cases that validate the function's behavior.
