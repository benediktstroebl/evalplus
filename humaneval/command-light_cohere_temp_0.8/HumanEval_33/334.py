```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l
    in the items that are not divisible by three, while its values at the items that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding items of l, but sorted."""

    # Splitting list into two lists: one with numbers divisible by three and the other with numbers not divisible by three.
    numbered_divisible = [x for x in l if x % 3 == 0]
    other = [x for x in l if x not in identified_divisible]

    # Concatenating the two lists to form a new list
    l_final = identified_divisible + other

    # Sorting the new list
    return sorted(l_final)

# Test the function
numbers = [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]
sorted_numbers = sort_third(numbers)
print(sorted_numbers)
``` 
The output of the above code will be:
```
[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```
