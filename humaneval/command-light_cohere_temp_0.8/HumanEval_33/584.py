def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal

    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])

```
The function takes a list and returns a new list where the values at positions that are divisible by 3 are replaced with the corresponding value from the original list, and the values at positions that are not divisible by 3 are left unchanged. The function also ensures that the list is sorted in ascending order.
