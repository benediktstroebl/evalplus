    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in terms of numbers not divisible by three, and the list is sorted.

    number of the numbers divisible by three, are moved to the front of the list.
    # Numbers not divisible by three, are moved to the back of the list.
    return [list of numbers from lst, which are divisible by three."""
# Split the list into two sublists
lst_divisible = [num for num in lst if num % 3 == 0]

lst
```

The function `sort_third` takes a list `lst` as input and returns a sorted list `lst` in which numbers divisible by three are moved to the front and numbers not divisible by three are moved to the back. The function uses the two sublists to sort, and then combines the two sorted sublists into a single sorted list.
