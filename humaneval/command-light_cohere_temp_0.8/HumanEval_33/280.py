```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the index that are not divisible by three, while its values at the index that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding index of l, but sorted.
    """
    creates a list l', sets all the values divisible by 3 to 3, and leaves the other values as they are. 
    """
    creates a list l_', and sorts it using the sort() function, so that the values that are not divisible by three are at the front of the list, and the values that are divisible by three are at the back of the list.
    return l_

    return l'
```

Here is a simple example that tests the function:
```python
# Test the sort_third function
L = [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5, 6, 7]
# Function call
L = sort_third(L)

# Print the resulting list
print(L)
```
