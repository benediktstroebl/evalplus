```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted.
    Input:
    l: list
    """
    l = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]
    return sorted(l, key=lambda x: x // 3 if x % 3 else x)
```
The script defines a function named `sort_third` that takes a single argument, `l`, which is a list. The function then processes this list `l` and returns a new list, `l'`, which is a sorted version of the original list.

The function uses the built-in function `sorted` to sort the elements of the list. The function then defines a lambda function that takes an element `x` of the list and returns the result of the division of that element by three. The lambda function is then passed as the key argument to the `sorted` function.

Finally, the function returns the sorted list `l'`, which is a modified version of the original list `l` that is sorted based on the values of the elements that are divisible by three.
