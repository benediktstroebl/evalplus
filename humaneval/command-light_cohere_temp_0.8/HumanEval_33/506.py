```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted.

    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    >>> sort_third([11, 22, 33, 9, 99])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '33'
    """

    # Create a new list l' that only contains the values of l that are divisible by three.
    l = [list([x for x in l if x % 3 == 0])

    # The values of l' are equal to the values of l, but sorted.
    l.sort()

    sure list of the list()  # Because the values of l are divisible by three.
    return l'

    # Return the list l' that is identical to l, but sorted to exclude values that are divisible by three.

```  This approach is efficient and simple, and it does not require any additional data structures or loops. It is simply creates a new list that contains only the values of l that are divisible by three, and then sorts the values of l' and l to ensure that the values of l' are equal to the values of l, but sorted.
