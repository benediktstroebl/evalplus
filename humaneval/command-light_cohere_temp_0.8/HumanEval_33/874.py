This Python script defines a function called sort_third that takes a list l as input and returns a modified list l'. The function sorts the elements in l that are not divisible by three, while it leaves the elements divisible by three unchanged. It achieves this by mapping non-integer elements to strings, allowing the built-in `sort` function to sort the entire list.
