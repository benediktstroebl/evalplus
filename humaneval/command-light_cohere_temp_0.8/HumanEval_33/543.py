The code defines a function `sort_third` that sorts a list l such that some of its values are divisible by 3. It uses list comprehensions and the list slice assignment to construct the new list l'. The original list l is updated with the new list, and then l is sorted using the sort() method. The sorted list is then assigned back to the original list, which results in the original list being sorted as required. 

This code is a self-contained Python script that provides a solution to the problem described in the prompt.
