# Example usage:
lst = [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]
print(filter_thirds(lst))  # Output: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9]

```
The script defines a function `sort_third` that sorts a list such that values divisible by three are at their proper relative positions and are sorted with other values. The `filter_thirds` function returns a new list that has elements divisible by three at the beginning and end, and the middle element is the largest number divisible by three. The example usage demonstrates how the can call these functions and pass the input list to sort.
