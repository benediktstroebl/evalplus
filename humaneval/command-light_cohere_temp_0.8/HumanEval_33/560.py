# Test case 1
test_lst = [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third(test_lst))
# Expected output: [1, 2, 3]

# Test case 2
test_lst = [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]
print(sort_third(test_lst))
# Expected output: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]

# Test case 3

```

The code has a function named sort_third, which sorts a list of numbers so that numbers that are not divisible by three are at the beginning and numbers divisible by three are at the end. The function uses the the unique approach to sorting that meets the requirement of the problem statement. 

The test cases validate that the function works correctly for different lists of numbers.
