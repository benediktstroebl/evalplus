``` 
This function takes a list l and returns a new list l' that is a more efficient and shorter version of the original list l. The function uses list comprehension to create a new list that contains the values in l that are divisible by three, and the values in l that are not divisible by three. The function then returns the value of l' to the variable l, which is the original list l with the two lists combined together.
