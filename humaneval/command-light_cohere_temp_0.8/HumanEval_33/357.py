The provided Python script defines a self-contained function `sort_third` that takes a list `lst` as input and returns a new list `new_lst` that sorts the elements in `lst` according to the logic described in the function. 

The function `get_per_three` checks whether a given number `num` is divisible by three and returns its corresponding index in the list, or `None` if not. 

Finally, it tests the function with some sample cases and prints the results.
