    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that 
    l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal to the 
    values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted.

In this version, the lst and return lists are identical to the input list l.
