```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the indic that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indic that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indic of l, but sorted.

    :param args:
    l (list): the list of numbers
    """
    l_copy = list(l)
    l_copy.sort()
     # l
    l_copy[::3] = l_copy[::3]
    l_copy[1::3] = l_copy[1::3] + l_copy[::3]
    l_copy[1::3] = l_copy[1::3] + l
    l_copy[1::3][::-1] = l_copy[1::3][::-1]
    return l_copy
```

The function takes a list l and returns a modified list where numbers divisible by three are moved to the end, and numbers not divisible are moved to the beginning. Numbers at the first and last index in the list are added together and then reversed.

The list is sorted using the sort() method. The sorted list is then used to create a new list that has numbers that are divisible by three at the end and numbers that are not divisible at the beginning. 

Finally, the new list is returned.
