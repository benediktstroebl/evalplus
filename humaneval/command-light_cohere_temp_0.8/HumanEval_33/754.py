```
The Python code defines a function called sort_third that takes a list l as input and returns a new list l'. It performs the sorting of the elements in l that are not divisible by three, and it treats the elements that are divisible by three as equal to the corresponding elements in l but in sorted order. 
The test cases show that the function works correctly for various types of lists and provides the expected results.
