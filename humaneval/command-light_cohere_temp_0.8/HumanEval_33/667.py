```python
def sort_third(lst):
    return sorted(lst, key=lambda x: int(x) // 3 if x % 3 == 0 else x)

# Test cases
print("First Test Case:", sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # Expected Output: [1, 2, 3]
print("Second Test Case:", sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # Expected Output: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
print("Third Test Case:", sort_third([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]))  # Expected Output: [30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
print("Fourth Test Case:", sort_third([10, 11, 12, 13, 90]))  # Expected Output: [11, 12, 13, 90]
```
This Python code presents a function named `sort_third`, designed to rearrange a list's elements into a specific ordering. It achieves this aim by utilizing the key function with a custom lambda expression. This lambda function compares the
 integers within a list and categorizes them into two groups: elements that are not divisible by three are assigned the same value as the original list, while those divisible by three are assigned values that are three times the original value. This sorting process iss a list to be sorted based on these criteria.

The code also includes a series of test cases, each designed to verify the correctness of the `sort_third` function. These test test are expected outputs for each test case, and the function is believed to be working as intended.
