This Python script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list `l'` such that `l` is a permutation of `l`, except that `l` contains no element divisible by three. The function uses the new list `l'` to remove all elements divisible by three from `l`. 

The function then returns the new list `l'`, which is identical to `l` except for these elements. The function also implements a test_sort_third` which takes an input list `test_list` and returns `True` if `test_list` does not contain any element divisible by three, and returns `False` otherwise.
