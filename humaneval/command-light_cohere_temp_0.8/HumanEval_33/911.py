    return l
```  This Python code defines a function called sort_third that takes a list l as input and returns a new list l'. The function achieves this by dividing the list into three sublists, taking the first as equal to the original list, the second as values divisible by three, and the third as values divisible by three but not divisible by three. 

The function then concatenates the sorted lists to form the final result, ensuring that elements that are not divisible by three are in their correct positions relative to elements divisible by three.
