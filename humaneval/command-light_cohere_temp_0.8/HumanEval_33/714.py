```python
def sort_third(lst):
    """This function sorts a list l such that the third values of the list's elements are sorted in ascending order.
    @param list lst:list
    @return: list
    """
    lst[:2] = sorted(lst[:2], reverse=True)
    return lst

#Example usage
my_list = [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]
print(sort_third(my_list)) 
```  This Python code defines a function called sort_third that takes a list as input and returns a new list with elements sorted in such a way that the third values of the list's elements are in ascending order. The function achieves this desired sorting by initializing the first and second elements of the list to be reversed, effectively flipping their original order. The example usage demonstrates how the a test for the sort_third function, using a sample list my_list and printing the resulting sorted list.
