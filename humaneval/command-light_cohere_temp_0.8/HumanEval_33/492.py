```  This script defines a function called sort_third, which takes a list l and returns a new list l_large that contains elements from l that are not divisible by three. The function uses the particular sorting algorithm to sort the elements in l that are divisible by three to the end of the list, and then places the remaining elements in l_large in the original order. The script also passes the previous tests by running the function on a sample list and comparing the output with the expected results.
