# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))      # Expected: [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # Expected: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
print(sort_third([10, 25, 50]))     # Expected: [50, 25, 10]

```
This script provides a self-contained function `sort_third` that sorts a list such that all numbers divisible by three appear first, and the other numbers in original relative order. The test cases validate that the expected output matches the one produced by the function.
