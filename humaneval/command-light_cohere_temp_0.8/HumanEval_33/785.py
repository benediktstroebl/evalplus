```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the
    third decimal place, while its values at decimals that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding decimals, but sorted.

    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 3]
    """

    # Use built-in sort() method with a custom key function
    l_sorted = sorted(l, key=lambda x: x / 1000)
    return l_sorted
``` 

This function takes a list l and returns a new list l_sorted, such that the elements in l_sorted are the same as the elements in l, but with the values of those elements in l_sorted being the same as the corresponding elements in l, but sorted. 

Note that the function is intended to sort the elements in l according to their third decimal place, while preserving the relative order of elements that are divisible by three.
