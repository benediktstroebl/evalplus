This Python code defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and modifies it by adding the last value to the list, so it will be sorted as desired. The function then returns the new sorted list. The script also includes a `test_sort_third` function, which contains an assertion test for the `sort_third` function to ensure its correctness. 

In essence, this code defines a sorting function for lists of numbers, and provides a way to test its correctness by running the test function and verifying the expected results.
