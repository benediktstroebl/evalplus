``` 
The Python script defines a function called `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list `l'` after applying the sorting algorithm. 

This function is designed to sort the list `l` such that the values at indices that are not divisible by three are kept as they are, while the values at indices that are divisible by three are equal to the corresponding values at other indices, but are sorted. 

Finally, an example of using the function is provided, and the sorted list is printed.
