This Python script defines a function named `sort_third` that sorts a list of numbers in a specific way. The function takes a first, it creates a new list `l' that contains the original list and its duplicates, then it uses a list comprehension to create two new lists, `list1` and `list2`, which contain the elements of `list` that are either divisible by three or not, respectively. The function then creates a new list `l' that contains the elements of `list1` and `list2` in sorted order, and then it returns this new list.
