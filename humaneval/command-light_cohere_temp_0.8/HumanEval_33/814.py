```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """Sorts list l such that all values that are divisible by three are sorted to their correct positions, while other values are sorted normally.
    """
   
    list comprehension is used to filter values that are divisible by three.
    A custom sorting function is created to sort the filtered values and values that are not divisible by three.
    Finally, the sorted list comprehension is used to sort the remaining values in the list.
```

The function uses list comprehension to filter out the values that are divisible by three, and then creates a custom sorting function to sort the filtered values to their correct positions. The sorted list comprehension is used to sort the remaining values in the list.

The function then returns the sorted list.
