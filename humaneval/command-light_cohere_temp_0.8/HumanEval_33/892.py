```  The provided code defines a Python function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a modified list `l'` with elements that are not divisible by three sorted. The function achieves this similarity by keeping the values of the indices that are divisible by three the same as in `l`, but the actual values of these indices are not modified. The function then sorts the  the remaining elements that are not divisible by three. 

The function is tested using the `test_sort_third` function, which creates a test list with specific values and compares the expected and the actual results of the `sort_third` function.
