This code defines a `car_race_collision` function that simulates the collision of two cars on a straight road. It assumes that two cars move into each other's lane change at the same time and result in a collision. The `test_collision_function` tests the collision function with a given number of cars and passes the test. This function simulates a cars driving in opposite directions and colliding with each other at the same time, which is a common scenario in the `car_race_collision` function.
