```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. Each car will have the car moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. 

    function outputs number of collisions.
    """The function returns the time, speed, and position of the cars, based on their position on the road.
    ```
```

This code follows the requirements of the problem statement, and solves the car race collision problem. 
The function takes an integer n as input, which represents the number of cars on the road. The function then uses the mathematical formula to calculate the time, speed, and position of each car at every moment.
