    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    Each car has the an infinite amount of maneuvering space, so when moving left to right hits a car that's driving right to left, 
    they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. 
    Eventually, all cars will reach the other end of the line.
    The function returns True if there were any collisions.

``` 
This function uses a simple geometric model where two cars will collide if their current position (x) intersects the future position (x) of another car at any point in the future. The function returns True if any such collision occurred or not by returning a sum of all pairs of x-values that do not result in an overlap. 
The test is to ensure that the function always returns the number of collisions, and it passes the test.
