Here's a self-contained Python script that implements the car race collision problem solution:

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    Two cars are collision; each car moves with a constant speed in a straight line.
    The function outputs the number of collisions
    """
    # Initialize the position of all cars to be at the starting point
    cars = [(n - 1) * 10, (n - 2) * 10]  # First and second car start from (-1, -2)

    # First car starts moving
    cars[0][0] = 100  # Move the first car to the right
    # Second car starts moving
    cars[1][0] = 0  # No movement for the second car yet

    # Move all cars for a fixed duration
    time = 1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(len(cars)):
            cars[j][cars[j][0]] += time
            # Update the positions of all cars
            # Update the positions of the colliding cars
            if cars[0][0] == cars[1][0]:
                cars[0][1] = cars[1][1] + 1  # Collision: The first and second car meet and overlap
                cars[1][1] = cars[0][1] + 1  # Collision: The first and second car overlap
                return 2  # Number of collisions

            # If no collision occurs, move the other cars to the right
            # Update the position of the third car
            cars[0][0] = cars[0][0] + time
            # Update the position of the third car (assuming the first two didn't collide)
            if cars[1][0] > cars[0][0]:
                cars[1][1] = cars[1][1] + time
            else:
                cars[0][1] = cars[0][1] + time

    return 0  # No collisions occurred
```

This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision problem. It initializes thege positions of cars, and then moves each car for a fixed duration. The script checks for collisions between the cars, and when two cars collide, it returns 2. The script also ensures that if no two cars collide, it moves the remaining cars to the right and updates the positions of the individual cars.
