```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. Each car has the same speed.
    Two cars will collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    Returns the hope number of cars that collide.

This Python script defines a function called **car_race_collision** that simulates a head-to-head collision between two vehicles on an infinite straight road. 

The function takes an integer **n** as input, which represents the number of vehicles on the road. 

The function uses a simple case scenario where two vehicles are moving towards each other on the road. 

The vehicles are modeled as having infinite strength, so they continue moving along their respective trajectories even after the collision. 

The function also returns the number of cars that collide, which is the total number of vehicles on the road (left and right) at the moment of the collision.
