```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed. 
    Two cars are crash when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
This Python code defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a simple car race collision scenario. The function takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of cars participating in the race. The cars are driving in opposite directions along a straight line. 

The function simulates the collision of these cars, and the result is the number of cars that have collided. The simulation is based on the assumption that the cars are infinitely strong and would continue moving in their original direction even after a collision.
