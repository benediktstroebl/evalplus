```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed; two cars will collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. 
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
    return sum(1 for i in range(n)) - sum(2 for i in range(n))
```
This Python function car_race_collision solves the "Car Race Collision" problem, which is the task of counting the number of collisions between a set of n cars driving toward each other on a straight road. The function uses mathematical reasoning and summation to calculate the total number of collisions.
