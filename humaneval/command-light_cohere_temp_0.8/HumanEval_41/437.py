```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. A car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    When two cars have identical velocities. If they collide, they continue moving in their original direction as if the collision didn't happen.

    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
This code defines a function car_race_collision that simulates a head-to-head collision between two cars on a frictionless road. It works as follows:
1. Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
2. The function takes an input n, which is the number of cars driving simultaneously on the road.
3. Each car drives in one direction and starts out from the starting point at an equal distance.
4. When a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, it collides.
5. The cars are identical in speed and direction, so they will continue moving in their original direction after the collision.
6. The function outputs the number of collisions that happen.

Please note that this is a simplified model and doesn't take into account factors such as road curvature, braking, or car details. The code can be a foundation for more complex traffic simulation tasks.
