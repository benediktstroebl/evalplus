```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed and start out being very far from each other.

    If cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
This code defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates a car race scenario with two directions of car movement (left to right and right to left) and counts the number of collisions between these sets of cars. The function is similar to the description provided in the prompt, with the only difference being the use of the n parameter, which specifies the number of cars in the race.
