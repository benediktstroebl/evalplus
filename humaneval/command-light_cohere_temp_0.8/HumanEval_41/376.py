    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.
    All cars have the move in the same speed, and two cars are heading to collide.
    Each car is moving to the right hits the car that's moving to the left, and they continue moving
    in their trajectory. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong.

    This function outputs thea number of collisions.

This Python script defines a self-contained function `car_race_collision` that solves the problem of a road with cars moving left and right simultaneously and colliding. The `test_collision` function tests this function to determine if it outputs the correct number of collisions.
