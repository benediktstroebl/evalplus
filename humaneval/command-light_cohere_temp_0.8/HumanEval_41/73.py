```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    All cars move in the same speed, two cars want to collide.
    When a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, 
    a collision occurs. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
This Python code defines a function called `car_race_collision`, which simulates a scenario of cars racing towards each other on a straight road. It creates the concept of a road that is an infinitely long straight line. The function then describes a scenario where multiple cars are driving towards each other simultaneously, with some cars wanting to collide with each other. The cars are described to move at the same speed, and when a car that is moving to the right is hit by another car moving to the left, a collision occurs. The cars are strong, so they continue moving in their respective directions as if they did not collide. Finally, the function outputs the number of collisions that occurred during the simulation.
