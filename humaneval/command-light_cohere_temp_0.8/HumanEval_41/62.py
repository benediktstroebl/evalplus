Here's the Python code that solves the problem of two cars colliding on a straight road in markdown:
```python
def car_race_collision(n):
    # Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    # n cars driving left to right, simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    # All cars are each in the same speed, and they will collide.
    # as soon cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, they continue moving
    # in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    return = [ ...return 2] # n-car collisions. 
```

This function defines a car race collision problem and returns the number of collisions.
