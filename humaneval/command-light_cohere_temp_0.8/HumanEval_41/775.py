 ``` 
This code defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates a car race collision. It takes a scenario of two sets of cars moving towards each other on a straight road. The cars are "infinite strength" so they continue moving along their paths after the collision. The function counts the collisions and returns the number of cars that were involved. 
The test case at the end ensures that the function works correctly with a value of n = 7.
