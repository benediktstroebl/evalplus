    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    As two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. When a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, a collision occurs. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The function outputs the number of collisions that happen.

The function `car_race_collision` solves the car race problem and passes the test. The function takes an parameter `n` that represents the number of cars in the race. The function works by assuming that there are `n` cars driving towards the left simultaneously. The function then assumes that each car is moving at a constant speed and that they are infinitely strong and durable. The cars then continue moving in the same direction as they were moving before the collision. The function then returns the number of collisions that happened during the race.
