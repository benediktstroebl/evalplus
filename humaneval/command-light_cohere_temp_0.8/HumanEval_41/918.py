```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and direction. Two cars will meeting collision will the would do so by checking which set of cars they belong to and who is moving towards them. When they collide, they continue moving in their original direction.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
This function takes an integer n as input and returns the number of collisions between the cars. It works by simulating the cars moving towards each other on an infinitely long road. When two cars collide, they continue moving in their original direction, as if they had not collided. The function checks which set of cars the car is moving towards and which set of cars the other car belongs to, and counts the number of collisions.
