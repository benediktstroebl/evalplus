```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and are infinitely sturdy and strong.
    All cars attempt to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.

```

The Python code defines a function car_race_collision that simulates a car race collision scenario. It takes the n parameter, representing the number of cars participating in the race. The function creates a imaginary scenario of a straight road and opposing car directions. Cars are driving towards each other, with each car maintaining the same speed. When a left-moving car collides with a right-moving car, the collision is resolved, and both cars continue moving along their respective trajectories. 

The function returns the number of collisions that occurred during the race. The code is self-contained and effectively simulates a car race collision scenario with a specified number of cars.
