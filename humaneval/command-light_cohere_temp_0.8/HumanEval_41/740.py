```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and move
    as if they never collide, just in opposite directions.
    no collisions.

    The function outputs True collisions.

```

Is there anything else I can help you with?
