```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 

    same sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. A car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. 

    cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
This Python code defines a function called **car_race_collision** that simulates a car race collision on an infinitely long straight road. The function takes an integer n as input, which represents the number of cars participating in the race. It uses the infinite line concept, where cars are driving in opposite directions along the road. The function simulates the collision of cars that are driving towards each other. It determines the number of collisions based on their movements. The collisions are calculated based on the relative positions and directions of the cars. The function then outputs the number of collisions that occurred during the race.
