```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars have the brothers have the same speed, and the collision is elastic.
    This function outputs the number of collisions.

```

This Python script defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision scenario. The function takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of cars participating in the race. The cars drive towards opposite directions along a straight line, and the collision is modeled as an elastic collision, where the cars continue moving in their original directions. The function returns the number of collisions. The `test_car_race_collision` function contains a simple assertion that checks whether the `car_race_collision` function with 4 cars as input would return 4 collisions, which is the expected behavior. This script serves as a test for the `car_race_collision` function, passing the test and verifying that the function behaves correctly.
