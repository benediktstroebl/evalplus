```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    This two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed.
    Two cars intended to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```

The script defines a function car_race_collision that takes an integer n as input and solves the car race collision problem, where two sets of n cars start from opposite directions and collide with each other. The output of the number of collisions is returned.

The function uses dynamic programming to solve the problem, and the time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2). 

You can use this function to solve the car race collision problem and pass the corresponding tests.
