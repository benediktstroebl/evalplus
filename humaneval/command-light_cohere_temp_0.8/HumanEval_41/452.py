```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.
    All cars have the specified speed. 
    Two cars are the the to collide, 
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. 

    the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    Returns the number of collisions. 

    test of a can be a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing a car and a collision direction. 

test_collision_result = car_race_collision(5)
assert len(test_collision_result) == 10
``` 
This Python script defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates a road with two-way traffic. The function creates a set of n cars, each driving in opposite directions along a straight line. The function simulates a cars colliding with each other, and returns a list of collision results, which represent the cars involved in each collision. The script then tests the claim that the length of the returned list is 10, which matches the expected number of collisions. 

Please note that this code assumes a specific and straightforward scenario where cars are moving along a straight line, and the direction of motion is considered "left to right" or "right to left".
