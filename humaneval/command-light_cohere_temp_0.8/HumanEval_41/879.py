```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. Each car will move the actual speed. 

    cars move in the same speed; the two cars will collide when moving into each other. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they will continue moving along their original path. The function returns True if there was a collision.
```

The code is a self-contained function that solves the car-race collision problem, where two cars are moving in opposite directions and collide with each other. The function returns True if there was a collision and prints a message indicating the collision. 

This is just one example of a function that can be used to solve the car-race collision problem.
