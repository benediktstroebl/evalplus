```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. 
    Two cars move in the collision, if a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, the two cars will continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide, without any effect on each other.

    This output is the number of collisions. 

```
This function simulates a head-to-head collision between n cars on a straight road, following the collision rules described. It uses a time to check if the two cars are moving towards each other and collide, in which case they continue moving without any impact.
