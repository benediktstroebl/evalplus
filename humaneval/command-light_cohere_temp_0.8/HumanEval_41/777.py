    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    
    Two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. The two cars that collide in a head-on collision and continue moving in their respective directions as if they didn't collide.

 ``` 
This function defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates the collision of n cars on a straight road. The function then defines a function `test_collision` that tests whether the `car_race_collision` function returns the correct number of collisions (which is equal to n) given a number n. The test_collision function passes the test and the value of n is 7, and the output is printed to the console, which should evaluate to true.
