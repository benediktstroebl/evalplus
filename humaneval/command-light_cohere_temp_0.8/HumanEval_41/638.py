```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    # All cars move in the same speed; two cars hit head-on and collide.
    return n*(n - Collisions
    """
This function simulates a road where n cars are driving towards the left simultaneously, and returns the number of collisions that occur between them. The function assumes that cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, and that they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
