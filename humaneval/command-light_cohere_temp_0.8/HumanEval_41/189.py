```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    All cars move in the same speed and direction. 
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
    """

```
This function simulates a race collision between n cars on the road, where some cars are driving in opposite directions along the road. The cars are considered the same speed, and the function determines if the cars collide based on their relative positions and directions. It also checks if there are no collisions, which means the cars continued moving along their paths after the collision.
