```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed.
    Two cars are to collide, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return:  is the number of collisions.
    return collisions

```

This function defines a car_race_collision that simulates a head-to-head collision between two vehicles on an infinite road. It takes the collision if the scenario of two vehicles moving towards each other, and their collision is resolved by having both vehicles continue moving along their original paths.

The output of this function is the number of collisions that occur. 

This is a self-contained Python script that can be used to solve the problem.
