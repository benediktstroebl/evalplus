```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. Each car keeps moving at a same speed. When a left car hits the hitting a car that's moving right to left, they both continue moving in their trajectories as if they did not collide. 

    both cars move in the same direction and keep moving at the same speed. 

     After two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other. All cars continue moving in their same line at the same speed. 
    Returns number of collisions. 

 return the number of the collisions. 
```
This function simulates the car race collision scenario where two sets of cars are driving towards each other on a straight line. The cars are infinitely strong and will continue moving in their respective directions without interruption. The function also counts the number of collisions between the cars, and returns the total count.
