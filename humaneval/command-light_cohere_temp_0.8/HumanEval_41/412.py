```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. All cars have the one speed. 
    Two cars are them in the same speed and the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    # Two cars are move into each other
    # One car hits the other car (collision)
    # Both cars continue moving in the same direction
    # There are 'n' collisions
    return 2 * n
