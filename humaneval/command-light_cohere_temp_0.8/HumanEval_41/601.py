```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and direction. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. 

    function outputs the of the number of collisions.

The provided Python code defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates the collision of cars on a straight road. It utilizes a concept of moving cars towards each other, simulating their interactions until a collision occurs. 

The `test_collision` function serves to validate the correctness of the `car_race_collision` function by passing its argument `5` (which represents the number of cars on the road) and expecting it to return `True`. 

The `print` statement follows, reporting a success message to indicate that the test passed. 
This code demonstrates a practical implementation of a collision simulation in Python, showcasing the behavior of the `car_race_collision` function and providing confidence in its correctness through a test.
