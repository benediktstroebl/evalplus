```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. Each car is in each set moves with the same constant speed. Two cars will meet to collide if one car is moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    If cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their direction.
    return: A tuple containing the two integers representing a pair of colliding cars.
    time: float representing the time of collision.
    """ A tuple containing two integers representing a pair of colliding cars.
    """ A tuple containing two floating-point numbers representing the speed of the colliding cars before the collision.

    time of collision. The function outputs the time of collision and the distance between the colliding cars

You can use this function to solve the Car Race Collision problem and pass the corresponding tests.
