```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars will driving in opposite directions collide, and the function outputs the number of collisions.
```
This function simulates a race collision between n cars. It takes the same scenario where two sets of cars are driving towards each other on opposite sides of an infinite straight road. The cars are assumed to be infinitely strong, so they will continue moving along their original trajectories after the collision event. The function then counts the number of collisions that occur.

The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the number of cars in the race. The space complexity is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of space.
