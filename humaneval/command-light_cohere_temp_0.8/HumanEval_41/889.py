```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. All cars have the confidence in their ability to withstand a collision.
    return the number of cars that will collide.
    n = n // 2 **
    if n < 1:
        return 0
    return sum((c1 * c2) for c1, c2 in zip(list(range(n)) * [range(n)[:-::-1])))
```
This function takes an integer n as input, which represents the number of cars on the road. The function returns a number of collisions between the cars, which is the sum of the product of the corresponding car pairs.
