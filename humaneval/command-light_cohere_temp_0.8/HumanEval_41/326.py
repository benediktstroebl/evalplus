# Example usage 
n = int(input("Enter number of cars: "))
a = [int(input("Enter car number: ")) for _ in range(n)]

In this script, we define a function called `car_race_collision` that takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of cars on the road. The function simulates the cars moving towards each other, and returns the number of collisions that occur. We then take two inputs for the numbers of cars, and store them in two lists. The `car_race_collision` function is then called with these lists, and it returns the number of collisions.

Finally, we print out the result of the function call, which represents the number of cars that collide with each other on the road.
