```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed; 
    two cars move towards each other on the road.
    When a cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```

The code defines a function that simulates a car race collision scenario. It takes the number of n cars driving in opposite directions on a straight line. 

The function ensures that cars are moving in their respective directions and collide with each other only when they are close enough and moving towards each other. 

The cars are assumed to be infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving along their paths after the collision without disruption. 

The function also counts the number of collisions, which represent the cars that meet each other's criteria and get stuck in their respective paths.
