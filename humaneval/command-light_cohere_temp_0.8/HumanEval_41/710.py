Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem of two cars colliding on a straight road:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed and are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    This function outputs the
number of collisions:
    """
    # Set the initial positions of the cars.
    cars = [[0 for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)]
    # Set the initial direction of motion for each car
    for i in range(n):
        cars[i][0] = 1 - i  # Index of the car is 0 based on left-right orientation.
    # Simulate the object to find the collisions and output the number of collisions
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if cars[i][0] < 0 and cars[j][0] < 0:
                # Check if the left-moving car hits the right-moving car
                if (cars[i][1] + cars[j][1]) < 1:
                    cars[i][2] = 1
                    cars[j][2] = 1
                else:
                    cars[i][2] = 0
                    cars[j][j] = 0
                break
            if cars[i][0] < 0 and cars[j][0] > 0:
                # Check if the right-moving car hits the left-moving car
                if (cars[i][1] + cars[j][1]) < 1:
                    cars[i][2] = 1
                    cars[j][2] = 1
                else:
                    cars[i][2] = 0
                    cars[j][j] = 0
                break
    return cars[0][2]
```

This code defines a function called `car_race_collision` that simulates the motion of a set of n cars on a straight road. The function takes an integer n as input and returns the number of collisions that occur between the cars.

The function works by setting the initial positions and directions of motion for each car. It then uses nested loops to simulate the movement of each car and to check for collisions with the other cars. If a collision is detected, the function records the collision and updates the positions of the cars accordingly.

This code is a simple example of a collision detection and resolution problem using a discrete-time simulation approach. It can be used to analyze and optimize real-world traffic scenarios or other similar applications.
