```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed and direction. Two cars are collide when they are moving in opposite directions and are in close proximity. They continue moving in their same direction afterwards. The function outputs the number of collisions.
```

This function simulates a car race collision scenario with two sets of cars moving towards each other. It checks if the cars are moving in opposite directions, they will collide and continue moving in the same direction. The number of cars and the direction of movement determine the outcome of the collision.
