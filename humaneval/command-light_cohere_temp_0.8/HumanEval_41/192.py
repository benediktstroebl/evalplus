```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    All cars move in the same speed. Two cars moving to collide will when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return:
    return True  if all collisions are successful (cars continue moving)
    False otherwise.
    """
```
This function simulates the "car race collision" scenario you described. It returns True if all collisions are successful and the cars continue moving, and False otherwise.
