```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    As the two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. When a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, a collision happens. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    The function outputs the number of collisions.
 its a simple case, we can solve this using a nested loop.

Test case:
```python
import math

def test_collision(n):
    num_collisions = 0
    num_cars = n // 2 + 1
    for i in range(num_cars):
        for j in range(i + 1, num_cars):
            if (i == j):
                continue
            car_speed = (math.infty / 2)
            relative_speed = math.pi / 2
           
            total_time = (math.pi / car_speed)
            if (total_time < math.inf):
                num_collisions += 1
    return num_collisions

print(test_collision(100))

This code defines a function `test_collision` that simulates the collision of two cars on a straight road. The function uses a concept of relative speed and total time to determine if a collision has occurred. The function then returns the number of collisions, which is set to be equal to the number of cars in the road.
