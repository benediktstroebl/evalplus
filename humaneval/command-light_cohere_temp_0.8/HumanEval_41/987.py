```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. When a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, they collide and continue moving in their respective trajectories. 

    function outputs True collisions that happened.

This script defines a function that simulates a car race collision. It consists of several functions representing drivers, vehicles, and a collision detection mechanism. The function runs in the race, checking for collisions between the cars, and outputting the results of the collision. You can modify the
input to the number of cars to race. This code is a a simple and straightforward way to solve the car race collision problem.
