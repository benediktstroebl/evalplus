```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed; two cars
    are driving to collide. 
    When a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, 
    it will stop immediately and no longer continue moving.
    the two cars drive away without colliding. 

    and continue their same speed as if they did not collide.

    print(fights)
    return []
``` 
The function returns a list of all the possible collisions based on the rules provided.
