```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. Two cars, in this pair, will collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. 
    Each car's moving left to right and each car in the left-right pair has a speed of 0.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return the number of collisions.
```
This function uses the two car approach, which is that two cars will collide if they are moving towards each other. The function works by comparing the speed of the two cars and stopping them if they are moving towards each other. 

Finally, the function returns the number of collisions. This is number of collisions is the number of cars that were moving towards each other and hit each other. 

This function can be used to solve the car race problem in a markdown code block by passing the number of cars as an argument.
