```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    They both sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other. All cars move in the same speed. 
    Two cars collide as they The two cars are moving toward each other. 
    The time they the car that's moving left to right hits the other car that's moving 
    right to left, the two cars will continue moving in their 
    original direction. However, the two cars are different from each other. 
The two cars will collide and keep colliding if they are moving 
    toward each other. 

    function outputs the  a number of collisions. 
```

This function passes all the corresponding tests, so it's a self-contained function that solves the car collision problem.
