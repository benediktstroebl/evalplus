```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. All cars have the same same in the same speed. Two cars moving towards colliding are designed to drive over each other, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. The collision point is the point where the cars begin to move over each other.

    The function outputs the collision point.
    """
The collision is represented as the cars moving over each other. The speed of the cars are assumed to be the same. The time that they car is moving left to right, and the other car is moving right to left.

# Examples:
# Test the function with n=2
collisions = car_race_collision(2)
print("Collisions:", collisions)

# Test the function with n=10
collisions = car_race_collision(10)
print("Collisions:", collisions)
``` 
This Python script defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates the collision of two vehicles on a straight road. The function takes an integer n as input, which represents the number of vehicles on the road. The vehicles are moving in opposite directions, and the function determines the collision point when the vehicles start to move over each other. The function returns the result in the collision point, which is represented as the vehicles moving over each other. The output is the number of collisions, which is the number of vehicles that have collided.
