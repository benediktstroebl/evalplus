```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars will
    provided with are infinitely sturdy and strong; 
    as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.

def test_car_race_collision():
    assert car_race_collision(4) == 2

# Driver's tests
test_car_race_collision()
```

The provided Python script defines a function called `car_race_collision` that simulates a collision between two cars on a straight road. The simulation is based on the concept that cars will continue moving in their direction unless they collide. The function works by starting with two cars driving in opposite directions and calculating the time it takes for them to collide. 

The function also takes an argument `n`, which represents the number of cars driving on the road. The output of the function is the number of collisions between the two cars, and it is passed as an assertion to test the correctness of the function.

The script also provides a test function `test_car_race_collision` that calls the `car_race_collision` function with the argument `4` and asserts that the output is `2`.
