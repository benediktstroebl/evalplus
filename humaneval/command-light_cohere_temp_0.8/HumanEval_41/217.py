Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. All cars have the Because car with the smaller index 'i' is moving in the
    direction of (1, -1) with a speed of 1. The cars are infinitely sturdy and
    strong.

    When the cars hit each other, they continue moving in their
    trajectory as if they did not collide.

    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```

This function takes an integer n as input, representing the number of cars in the race. The cars are driving on a straight line, with the speed of 1, and the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong. The cars will collide with each other, and the function returns the number of collisions that have occurred.
