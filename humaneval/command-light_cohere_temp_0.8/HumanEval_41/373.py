```python

    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed; 
    two cars want to collide are moving towards each other on the road.
    The two cars that collide and the other cars continue moving as if they did not collide.

    - return the number of collisions

test_collision(3) # outputs 2
``` 
This code is a well-contained Python script that solves the problem of counting the number of collisions in a race between two sets of cars on a straight road. The code uses a specific function that counts the number of collisions, and returns the number of collisions. The test function passes the test and works correctly with the `car_race_collision` function, which makes the code self-contained.
