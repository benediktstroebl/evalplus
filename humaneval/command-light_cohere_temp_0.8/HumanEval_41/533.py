```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    As two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and move with uniform speed. 
    Two cars are hit and collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
The function is designed to model a race collision scenario, where two sets of cars are driving towards each other along a straight road. The function takes an integer input 'n' which represents the number of cars involved in the collision. 

This function is self-contained, and does not rely on any external functions or modules. It can be used as a definition of a mathematical concept or a piece of code that can be reused in different contexts.
