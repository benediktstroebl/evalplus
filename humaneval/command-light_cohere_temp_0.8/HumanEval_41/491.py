```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. Each car moves in the same speed, and two cars will collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    Return the the number of collisions.
```

This function simulates a road with two directions of cars moving. It takes an parameter ** n ** as the number of cars. The function then simulates the movement of n cars driving towards the right at the same time, and it checks if any two sets of cars meet each other simultaneously, then the function returns the number of collisions.

This function can be used to solve a variety of problems involving car races.  It can be used to simulate and analyze different scenarios and improve the design of a race track.
