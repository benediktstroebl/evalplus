```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and move along their respective trajectories
    until they collide. 

    The function outputs the number of collisions. 

This function can be used to simulate a car race scenario with a set of vehicles and collisions.
