    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    Two cars want to collide.
    When the right cars start out moving to their right positions, and the left cars start moving to their left positions.
    The process continues until there are no more collisions to be had. The function outputs True.

This script defines a function called car_race_collision, which simulates a traffic collision on an infinite road. It takes user input for the number of cars, then simulates the traffic collision. The cars start moving in opposite directions and continue moving until there are no more collisions.
