This script defines a function called **car_race_collision** that simulates a race collision between a specified number of cars on a straight road. The function runs a for a specified number of cars, checks for collisions between the cars, and counts the number of collisions. The function also initializes a number of collisions to zero and outputs the number of collisions.

Note that this code is a good starting point for solving the problem, but it can be further improved and optimized based on your requirements and preferences.
