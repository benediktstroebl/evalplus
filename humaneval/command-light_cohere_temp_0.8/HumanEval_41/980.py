```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed. Two cars want to collide
   
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. 
    Each car is moving continues its original trajectory.
