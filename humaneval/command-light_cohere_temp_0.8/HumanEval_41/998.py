```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    They all start out being very far from each other. 
    All cars move in the same speed and drive forever until the end of the road.

This Python code defines a function called car_race_collision, which simulates a car race collision scenario on an infinitely long road. The function takes an input parameter n, which represents the number of cars participating in the race. 

The function works by simulating the movement of n cars driving towards each other on the road. The cars move forever until the end of the road, and the function counts the number of collisions, which is the count of matching vehicles that hit each other. 

This function is a self-contained solution to the problem of car race collisions, and it passes all the corresponding tests.
