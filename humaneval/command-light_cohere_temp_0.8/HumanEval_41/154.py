Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of two cars collision in a markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars have the waterways, and move in the same direction and speed.
    """
    line_collision = []

    # The starting positions of the cars
    for i in range(n):
        line_collision.append([i, 0])

    # The time of collision of the cars
    for i in range(n):
        line_collision[i] = sum(line_collision[(i+1):])

    # Determine the time of collision of the cars
    time_collision = line_collision[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        time_collision += line_collision[i] / (n - i)

    # Now, the time of collision of the cars is the time at which the two cars with the lowest speed meet.
    time_collision = min(time_collision, line_collision[0])

    # The final positions of the cars after collision
    final_position = line_collision[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        final_position += final_position[i] / (n - i) * (1 - line_collision[i])

    return final_position
```

This code defines a function car_race_collision that simulates a head-to-head car collision in a straight line. The function takes in the number of cars n and initializes a list of the starting positions of each car. Then, it calculates the time of collision of each car, determining the time at which the car with the lowest speed will collide with the car in front of it. Finally, the function calculates the final position of each car after the collision based on the calculated time of collision and their initial positions.
