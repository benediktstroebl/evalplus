```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed.
    The two cars are driving towards each other. They collide.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    This function outputs the unique number of collisions
    """
    collisions = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        collisions[i] = car_race_collision(n - 1) + i
    return collisions
``` 

This script defines a function car_race_collision that simulates the number of collisions between a set of cars on a straight road. The function uses a nested loop to simulate the movement of the cars, and the current number of collisions is calculated based on the previous number of collisions and the current position of the cars. The function then returns the unique number of collisions.
