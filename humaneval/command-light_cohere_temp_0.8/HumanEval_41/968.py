```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.
    All cars have the same in the same speed and direction; two cars
    want to collide. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
This Python code defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a car racing collision scenario on a straight road. 

It takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of cars involved in the race. 

The cars are driving in opposite directions, with some driving towards the left and some towards the right. 

The cars are assumed to be infinitely sturdy and strong, so when two cars collide, they continue moving in their respective directions as if no collision had occurred. 

The function calculates the number of collisions by checking if any pair of cars are moving towards each other and meet the requirements for a collision. 

The code is well-contained and can be run independently, providing a simulation of car collisions on a straight road.
