```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed, and two cars are driving towards each other to collide.
    Each car is moving to the right has a velocity vector (0,1) and each moving to the left has the velocity vector (-1,0).
    The two cars will collide if their distance vector is less than the sum of their velocity vectors.
    The solution: Calculate the total of the two velocity vectors and subtract them. The first car has a velocity vector and add the second car's velocity to it. The second car's velocity vector is the same thing.
    """
    test:
    For a specific number of cars, calculate if they will collide or not. 
```
This function is self-contained and will solve the problem and pass the test.
