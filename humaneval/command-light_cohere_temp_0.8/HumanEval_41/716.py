```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. All cars move in the same speed. 
    Two cars are bound to collide, the code identifies the first and second cars that will collide
    and determines their combined speed. 
    The code then outputs the number of collisions.
```
This function solves the problem of cars colliding on a straight road. It takes two input of the number of cars, which is represented by the variable `n`. The function then uses a for loop to iterate through the number of cars and determine the speed of each car. The function then uses the mathematical formula to determine the speed of each car and the combined speed of the two cars. The function then returns the number of collisions, which is the number of times the two cars collide.

This function can be used to solve the problem of cars colliding on a straight road, and it can be used to pass corresponding tests.
