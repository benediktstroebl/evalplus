```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars have the different speed. Two cars are different to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, the two cars will continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. This is result of the function outputs the number of collisions that occurred.
 it is a complex function that simulates the behavior of cars on a road.

n is the number of cars on the road, and each car moves with a different speed. This function takes the o time to simulate the race and returns the number of collisions.

It is a good example of a self-contained Python function that can be used to solve a problem and pass corresponding tests.
