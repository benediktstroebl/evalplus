```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    If two cars moving towards each other hit, they "collide". In this case, the cars continue moving along their original trajectories. The number of cars that collide is returned.

return: int(len([car for car in [c for c in cars_list] for c in [cars_list]]))
``` 
This Python function, car_race_collision, is designed to simulate the scenario of two sets of cars on a straight road colliding with each other. 

The function takes an input 'n', which represents the number of cars in each set. The cars in each set are stored in a list, and the cars_list variable is iterated over, creating a new list that contains each car from the previous list. 

The function then returns the number of collisions, which is the length of the list of cars that have collided. 

In this improved version, the cars are passed directly into the function as a list, and the number of collisions is returned as an integer, which is the length of the list of cars that collided.
