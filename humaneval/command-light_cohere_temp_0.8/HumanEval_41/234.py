```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):

    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return:
    n is the number of cars. When two cars are moving towards each other hit each other, they continue moving in their respective directions. The cars are identical in speed and strength, so the collision happens at the exact point of contact and the cars continue moving without any interruption. The number of collisions is the number of cars that hit each other.
