```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    As two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and they are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.

# Test
def test_collision():
    assert car_race_collision(4) == 4  # 4 cars driving left, 4 cars driving right, and they collide exactly once
```

This script defines a function car_race_collision that simulates the scenario of two sets of cars driving in opposite directions and colliding with each other. The test_collision function asserts that the output of car_race_collision with the argument 4 is equal to 4, which is the expected behavior of the function.

The purpose of this script is to provide a testable implementation of the car race collision problem in Python.
