```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. When a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, they collide and continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. This function outputs the
            number of collisions that happen between the cars.
```
This function simulates the scenario of two sets of cars moving towards each other on a straight road. The cars have the same speed, and the cars are considered to be infinitely strong, so they continue moving along their paths without stopping or reversing. The function then counts the number of collisions that have happened between the cars. 

You can use this function to solve the Car Race Collision problem for any given value of n.
