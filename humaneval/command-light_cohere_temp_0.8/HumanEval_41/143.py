    All cars move in the same speed and direction.
    Two cars are the collision, each car bounces off each other elastically.
    This time moves are calculated to be the same for each pair of cars involved in the collision.

    function outputs number of the collisions.

# Note: This function assumes that the cars are infinitely strong and have no effect to friction or any other external force.

This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a head-to-head collision between two cars on a straight road. It calculates the time to the collision, which is the same for all pairs of cars involved, and outputs the number of collisions. This function is tested for `n` and passes the test for the output and input `n` as an assertion.
