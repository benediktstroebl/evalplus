```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars will meeting collide as they approaching each other and stop moving immediately. 

    function outputs the each collision, indicating how many cars have collided and in which order. 
```
This function is self-contained and provides a solution to the problem statement.
