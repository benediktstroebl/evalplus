```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. A car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    Returns the number of collisions.
```
This Python code defines a function named `car_race_collision` which simulates the car race collision problem. It takes a a description of a road with cars driving both ways simultaneously. The function takes an integer parameter `n` which represents the number of cars on the road. The cars are assumed to start out very far from each other, and they all move at the same speed. 

The function simulates the cars moving towards each other until they collide. After the collision, the cars continue moving along their original trajectory, as if they did not collide. The function then returns the number of collisions, which represents how many cars have collided. 

You can use this function to solve the car race collision problem and pass the corresponding tests.
