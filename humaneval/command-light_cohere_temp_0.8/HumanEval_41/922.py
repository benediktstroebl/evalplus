```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    All cars move in the same speed; two cars want to collide, one moving left and the other moving right. 
    When each other. This function outputs the actual collision of cars (a tuple of their indices)
    in the order of cars that collide.
 are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    Returns: a tuple of the indices of the colliding cars.
    """
Note that the order of the indices in the output is important, and the function will not work correctly if you reverse the order.

```

Let's test the function:
```python
# Testing the car_race_collision function
n = int(input("Enter the number of cars: "))
result = car_race_collision(n)
print(result)
```
This will test the collision of two cars at the beginning of the road.
