This Python function car_race_collision simulates the "car race collision" scenario, where two sets of cars are driving towards each other on a straight road. The function works by using a simple and intuitive mathematical concept. It generates a number of collisions by summing up the natural number (1 for each car) in the range of numbers from 0 to n-1. 

The function is self-contained, as it does not rely on any external variables or modules. It can be easily understood, tested, and modified within the script.
