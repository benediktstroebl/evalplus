```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. 
    
    Two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars that are moving towards each other collide and continue moving in their trajectory. This function outputs True number of collisions.

test_collision = car_race_collision(4)
print(test_collision)  # Outputs the number of collisions

This code defines a function that simulates a car race collision scenario, where two sets of cars move towards each other on a straight road. It counts the number of collisions, which is the purpose of this function.
