    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. All cars have the full speed and are infinitely sturdy.
    When the cars move into each other without any damage, they continue moving
    in their respective direction as if they did not collide.
