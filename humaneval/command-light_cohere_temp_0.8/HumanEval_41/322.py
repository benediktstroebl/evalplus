```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. All cars move in the same speed and move in a straight line without
    any obstacle. 

    The function outputs the number of collisions. 
In the first test, it should output 2 as 2 cars drive towards each other and collide.
 in the second test, it should output 1 as the cars do not collide and keep moving in the same direction. 
In the third test, it should output 0 as no cars are in the way.
