```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. All cars move in the same speed. 
    Two cars are collision, it counts as one.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
This script defines a function `car_race_collision` which simulates a race collision between `n` cars on a straight road. The `cars` move in opposite directions with the same speed, and when they collide, it's counted as one collision. The function returns the number of collisions.
