```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    All cars have in the same speed; two cars facing each other collide and change their direction. 
    
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
 surprisingly, there are none!

n # number of cars on the road

```

This function simulates the scenario of two cars moving towards each other on a straight road, and it correctly identifies that there are no collisions, as the cars are moving along the same line.  Therefore, the number of cars is a parameter, and the function has been designed to solve the problem of identifying collisions in a given number of cars on the road.
