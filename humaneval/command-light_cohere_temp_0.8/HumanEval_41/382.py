```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. Each car moves in the same speed. Two cars
    carious collision 
    happens when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. All cars continue moving in their same path, as if they did not collide.

    return: number of collisions
    """return number of cars that collide"""

def test_collision():
    return car_race_collision(3) == 6
```
This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates the scenario of two sets of cars moving towards each other on a straight road. The function also returns the number of collisions that occur, which is then passed to the test function `test_collision` that checks if the function returns the expected number of collisions.
