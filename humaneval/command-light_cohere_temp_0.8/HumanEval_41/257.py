```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed. Two cars facing collision
    difference are set to each other, 
    each car will go through the other, and continue moving along its original trajectory. 
    In other words, no collision occurs. 

    function returns True. 
n / 2 combinations of cars meeting each other.
}

def test_collision():
    assert car_race_collision(2) == 4 # 2 cars driving left, 2 cars driving right, 1 meeting
    car_race_collision(3) == 6 # 3 cars driving left, 3 cars driving right, 2 meeting
    car_race_collision(4) == 8 # 4 cars driving left, 4 cars driving right, 2 meeting

This code defines a function that simulates the "car race collision" problem. It outputs the number of cars that meet each other. The test function verifies that the output of the function meets the expected collision.
