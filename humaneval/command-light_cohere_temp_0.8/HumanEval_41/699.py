    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. When a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, a collision occurs. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

This script defines a function car_race_collision that simulates the scenario of two sets of cars driving in opposite directions and colliding with each other. The function returns a list of collisions, which could be an empty list if there are no collisions.  The script is also designed to pass the corresponding tests.
