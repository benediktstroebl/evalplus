```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    Two cars are move in the same speed, and start out from the same distance. They collide, but instead of coming to a complete halt or changing direction.

    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the the collision count.

    return: number of collisions

test_collision_count(3):
    assert car_race_collision(3) == 4
    print("Test passed!")
```
This Python code defines a function called `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision scenario. The function takes an integer argument `n` representing the number of cars on the road. The cars start out from the same position and move towards each other at the same speed. When two cars move towards each other, they collide without coming to a complete halt or changing direction. The function then counts the collisions and returns the number of collisions. The `test_collision_count` function is used to test the `car_race_collision` function with the argument `3` (representing 3 cars). It asserts that the number of collisions is equal to 4, and prints "Test passed!"
