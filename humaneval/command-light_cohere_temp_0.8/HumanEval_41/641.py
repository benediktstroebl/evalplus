```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    If two cars moving in opposite directions collide, then they would "swallow" each other (both move past each other) without affecting each other's motion. In this way, the "collision" is defined as the cars moving in opposite directions and stop each other's motion.

    The function outputs the number of collisions that occurred.
    """
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming and backtracking, which involves iteratively solving smaller subproblems until a solution to the main problem is found.
```
Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the car race collision problem:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    # Declare variables
    done = []
    left_front = 0
    right_rear = 0
    collisions = 0

    # Backtracking algorithm to find collisions
    for i in range(n):
        # Search if left_front is at right_rear position
        if left_front == right_rear:
            continue
        # If not, then try to push the left_front to the right
        if i < n-1 and left_front < right_rear:
            left_front += 1
        # and right_rear moves to the left
        right_rear -= 1
        collisions += 1
        # If the right_rear is at the starting position, it means a collision with the next car
        if right_rear == 0:
            continue
        # If not, then search for the next left_front car
        if i < n-2 and left_front > right_rear:
            left_front -= 1
        # else, this is the last car, so done is true
        else:
            done.append(collisions)
            break

    return done
```
This function uses a backtracking algorithm to find all the collisions. It initializes a with a simple case and then uses "if-then" statements to recursively solve the problem. The function returns the final answer in the form of a list of collisions.

You can test the function with different values of n to see if it works correctly.
