```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. Each car moves in the same speed.
    Two cars want collision as theyate in the race and drive away from each other. 
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide. The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
This Python function, car_race_collision, is designed to model a car race scenario. It takes a `n` as an input, which represents the number of cars participating in the race. The function simulates the cars moving towards each other simultaneously, and when two cars collide, they drive away from each other and continue moving along their original trajectories. 

The function also takes into account the strength of the cars, which allows for the cars to continue moving without interruption after a collision, mimicking the behavior of real cars.

By running this function with a specific `n`, you can determine the number of collisions that occur in the race.
