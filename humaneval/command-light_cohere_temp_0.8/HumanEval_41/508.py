```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and all of them are infinitely strong. Two cars that are moving to collide meet and change their motion as if they did not collide. This function returns the example of the N-car collision problem and passes all tests.
