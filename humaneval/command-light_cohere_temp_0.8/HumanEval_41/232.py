```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. Each car moves in the same speed. Two cars
    one each other (moving to collide) hit each other, so the collision event will happen. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
This function, `car_race_collision`, takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of collisions between the `n` cars on the road.
