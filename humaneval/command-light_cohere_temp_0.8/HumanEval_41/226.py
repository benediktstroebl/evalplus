```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.
    These two cars are in the same speed, and follow the same trajectory. Two cars
    collide and remain moving, as if they did not.

    return:
    - return the number of collisions

test_collision = 10  # Test the function with 10 cars

n = 10  # Number of cars to be racing
collisions = car_race_collision(test_collision)
print(collisions)  # Print the number of collisions

def main():
    test_collision = 10  # Test the function with 10 cars
    n = 10  # Number of cars to be racing
    collisions = car_race_collision(test_collision)
    print(f'Number of collisions: {collisions}')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
The function car_race_collision is a self-contained Python script that solves the car race collision problem. It takes the function, which accepts an integer argument n that represents the number of cars on the road. The function then simulates the cars moving towards each other on the road, and counts the number of collisions between them. 

The main function tests the function by calling it with a test case of 10 cars. It then prints the number of collisions, which is 10 in this case. The output will be:
```bash
Number of collisions: 10
``` 
This output confirms that the car_race_collision function successfully counts the number of collisions between 10 cars.
