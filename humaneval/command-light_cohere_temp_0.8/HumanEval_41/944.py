This Python script defines a function called **car_race_collision** that simulates the scenario of two sets of cars on a straight road, with one driving left and the other driving right. It uses the the known that they will collide with each other and will continue moving in their respective directions. 

The function returns the number of collisions, which is the product of the number of cars in each set.
