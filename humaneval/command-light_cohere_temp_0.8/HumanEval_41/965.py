Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function that solves the car race collision problem in a markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars have theate in the same speed. Two cars are collision
    the result in a zero-cross.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    """
    result: return sum(speed[i] * ((n - car[i][0]) % n) for i in range(n))
```

The function car_race_collision solves the car race collision problem, which is to find the number of collisions between n cars driving towards each other along a straight line. The function uses the mathematical formula of the sum of the product of each car's speed and the absolute position of the car minus the car's position from the start, divided by the total number of cars. The result is to be the number of collisions.
