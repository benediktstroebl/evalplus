```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed.
    Two cars meet to collide.
    When a by the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return: return the count of the collisions

# Example usage

# Create two lists to represent cars and their positions
cars1 = [[1, 3], [2, 5], [4,7]]
cars2 = [[2,4], [5,6]]

# Calculate the time limit for collision
n = len(cars1)
time_limit = n*(n-1) / 2

# Use the function to calculate the number of collisions
collisions = car_race_collision(time_limit)

# Print the result
print(collisions)
```
This script defines a function car_race_collision that simulates a car race collision scenario. It takes a each set of cars moving towards each other, and determines the number of collisions based on the time limit. 

The time limit for collision is calculated as the product of the number of cars minus 1, and the cars are assumed to move at a constant speed. The function then uses this number of cars and their positions to calculate the number of collisions that will occur. 

Finally, the script prints the result of the number of collisions.
