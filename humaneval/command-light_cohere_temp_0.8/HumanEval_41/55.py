This Python code defines a function called `car_race_collision` that simulates a road with cars moving towards each other. It takes the two directions and eventually collide with each other, creating a collision matrix. It then calculates the individual cars' movement in both directions and identifies collisions between them. Finally, it prints the number of collisions on the road, simulating a car race collision scenario.
