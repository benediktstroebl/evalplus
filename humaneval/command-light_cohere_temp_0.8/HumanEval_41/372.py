Here's the self-contained Python script that defines a function car_race_collision, which simulates a collision between two cars moving in opposite directions along a straight road:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. All cars have the What same speed.  Two cars are collision
    one car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates the described car race scenario. The function takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of cars involved in the race. The cars move towards each other along a straight line, and the function determines when and how many cars collide. The script outputs the number of collisions, which represents the number of cars that were involved in the collision.
