```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars will moving in the collision when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    In this scenario, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    The function returns the number of collisions.
```

# Run the function and get the number of collisions:
n = int(input("Enter the number of cars: "))
collisions = car_race_collision(n)
print(f"There are {collisions} collisions.")

```

The function car_race_collision takes an integer n as input, representing the number of cars on the road. The function then simulates the movement of n cars on the road, with some cars driving in opposite directions. When two cars collide, they bounce off each other, following the principle of infinitely strong and elastic cars. The function then returns the number of collisions that occur in the simulation, which could be any permutation of cars colliding with each other.
