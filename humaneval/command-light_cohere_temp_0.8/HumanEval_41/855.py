```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    As the different sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars have the partner with each other
    with identical speed. 

    Two cars are meant to collide. When a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, they will continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    number of collisions.
```
This function is self-contained and solves the problem of cars colliding on a straight road, and provides the number of collisions.
