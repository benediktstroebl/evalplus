```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    As two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed
    The two cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    This function outputs the necessary of collision (and zero, if no collision occurs).
    }
    return collisions
