```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    Two cars meet the violence against each other (because they are infinitely sturdy). 

    The cars move in their original direction after collision, which is the same as their original direction.

    The function outputs the number of collisions.
 as the following:
    - If the number of cars is even, there is 1 collision
    - If the number of cars is odd, there are 2 collisions.
