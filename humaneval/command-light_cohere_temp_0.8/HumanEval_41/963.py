```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 

    cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The function outputs the number of the collisions.

            colliding_car = Car(-i, 0, 10)
