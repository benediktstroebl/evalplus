```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. A car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. When two cars collide, they continue moving in their original trajectory as if they did not collide. The number of these collisions is returned.
```
This script defines a function car_race_collision that simulates a head-to-head collision between two cars on a straight road. The function takes in one argument, n, which represents the number of cars involved in the collision. The function uses dynamic programming techniques to simulate the collision and determine the number of cars that collide. The output of the function is the number of collisions, which is the number of cars that are moving in opposite directions and collide with each other.
