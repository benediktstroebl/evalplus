```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed; two cars will collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    The two cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    return: The number of collisions.

This script defines a function `car_race_collision` which solves the car collision problem for a set of vehicles with a given number of 'n'.  The function outputs the number of collisions between the vehicles. 

This function is self-contained, and it passes the tests for correctness with the problem statement.
