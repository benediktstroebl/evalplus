```python

    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.
    As the cars move in the same speed
    and direction, they will collide, without actually stopping. 
    Therefore, they will continue moving in their original trajectory. 

    function outputs the the collision number

    if n < 1:
        return 0
    return sum([1 for i in range(n+1) if i <= n // 2]) + sum([1 for i in range(n+1) if i > n // 2])

This function uses the mathematical properties of a road as an infinitely long line to determine if cars are colliding.
