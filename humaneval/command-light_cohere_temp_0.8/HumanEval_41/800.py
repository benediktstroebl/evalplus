```
This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a race collision of `n` cars. The cars are driving in opposite directions along a straight line. 

The `num_collisions` variable is set to 4, representing the number of collisions, and the code prints the value of `n` and `num_collisions` and returns this value.
