```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The function outputs the number of collisions that happened.
    """
Car drivers are wise; they don't run into each other! They follow the rules of classical mechanics, where there's no collision unless two objects actually meet.
