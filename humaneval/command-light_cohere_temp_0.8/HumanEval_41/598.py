Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the car race collision problem for any number of n:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    # Define the cars array, where each element represents a car's position.
    cars = [ [0, 0, 0, ..., n - 1]
    
    # Define the speed array, where each element represents a car's speed
    speed = [0, 0, 0, n, 0, 0]
    
    # Simulate the car race collision
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i == j:
                continue
            if cars[i] < cars[j]:
                speed[i] += speed[j]
            else:
                speed[j] += speed[i]
    
    return speed
```

This script defines a car_race_collision function that simulates the collision of n cars on a straight road, where cars move in the direction opposite to their positions. The cars array represents the the positions of the n cars, and the speed array represents the speed of each car. The function uses a loop to iterate over all pairs of cars and update the speed of each car by adding the speed of the other car if they are facing each other. 

This simulates the cars colliding and moving relative to each other. The final speed array will contain the speed of each car after the race.
