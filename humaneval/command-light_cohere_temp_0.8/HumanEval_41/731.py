```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    Two cars will drive in the same speed, and due to their infinite strength, they continue moving in their trajectory.
    If function takes an integer n and returns the number of collisions.

test_collision = [10, 20]
print(car_race_collision(test_collision)) # 30
```
This Python code defines a function called `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision scenario. It creates an test list with two integer values (10 and 20), representing the number of cars driving in opposite directions. The function then calculates the number of collisions between these cars, and the result is 30, meaning that there are 30 collisions in this specific scenario. This code showcases the value- being a fun and educational way to solve problems related to car collisions.
