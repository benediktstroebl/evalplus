```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. 
    Two cars are collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
This code defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates a head-to-head collision between n cars on a straight road. The cars move towards each other at a constant speed and collide when the front car of one set hits the back car of another set. The simulation is based on the assumption that the cars are infinitely strong and will continue moving in the same direction after the collision.
