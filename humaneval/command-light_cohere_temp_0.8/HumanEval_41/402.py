Here's the code:

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed, and two cars are driving towards each other to collide.
    The two cars have the same speed, and the direction of movement is opposite.
    """
    code uses a following logic:
    n cars are driving towards each other, so the number of collisions will be n.  The total number of cars is n. 

This code follows the idea of the road intersection problem, where the cars will collide if they are moving towards each other. 

The cars move at the same speed and the direction is opposite, so the collisions will happen.
