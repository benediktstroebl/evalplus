```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. All cars move in the same speed. 
    
    Two cars are the collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. 

    If function outputs the number of the collisions,
    which pass all the tests.
