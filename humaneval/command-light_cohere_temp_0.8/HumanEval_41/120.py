This Python code defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision scenario. It takes an input `n` representing the number of cars on the road. The cars are driving in opposite directions, and when two cars collide, they continue moving along their paths. 

This code is self-contained, and it can be used to solve the problem of car collision in a markdown code block.
