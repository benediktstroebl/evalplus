```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    
    This also set of n cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed, and two cars will collide as described. 
    
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
This function simulates the car race collision scenario with two cars moving towards each other on a straight road. The `car_race_collision` function takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of cars participating in the race. 

The function uses a simple simulation to determine if any pair of cars are moving towards each other and, if so, they will collide. If two cars are moving towards each other at the same speed, they will collide and continue moving in their respective directions.

The function then returns the number of collisions that occurred in the race.
