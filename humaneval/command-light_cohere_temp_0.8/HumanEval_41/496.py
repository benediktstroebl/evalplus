This Python code defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision scenario with two sets of cars moving in opposite directions along a straight line. The function takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of cars involved in the race. It then outputs the By applying the mathematical model of the collision, the cars are assumed to be infinitely strong and will continue moving along their respective trajectories. 

The test cases ensure that the function correctly predicts the number of collisions, and the output is validated against the expected values.
