    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed; two cars heading toward each other will collide.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return a time:
    # Initialize cars as a list of tuples.
    cars = [ [(f"{left_speed}", "right_speed") for f in [[10, 20], [20, 10], [30, 40]]]] 

    # Initialize positions as a list of tuples.
    positions = [(0, 0)] + [(n - 1) * 10 for n in range(n)]

    # Collision detection
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if positions[i][0] < positions[j][1]:
                # Collision occurred, update positions
                positions[i] = (positions[i][0] + positions[j][1], 0)
                positions[j] = (positions[j][0] + positions[i][1], 0)

    # Check if any cars are still moving
    if any(x != (0, 0) for x in positions):
        # No collision, all cars continue moving
        return positions
    else:
        # Collision occurred, all cars stop
        return [(0, 0)]

# Test
def test_car_race_collision(n: int):
    assert car_race_collision(n) == positions
    return positions

# Test cases
test_cases = [10, 50]
for n, tc in enumerate(test_cases):
    print(f"Test {n}...")
    print(f"Expected: {tc}")
    print(f"Got: {test_car_race_collision(n)}")
    print()

In this solution, the `car_race_collision` function simulates the motion of `n` cars on a straight road. It uses a` cars `as a list of car tuples, each representing a car's starting speed and direction. The `positions` list represents the starting position of each car. 

The `for` loop is used to simulate the motion of the cars by updating their positions based on their speeds. When the `for` loop completes, the function returns the positions of all cars. The `test_car_race_collision` function tests whether the `car_race_collision` function returns the correct positions and passes the test. 

Finally, the `test_cases` list contains a list of test cases, and the `for` loop is used to iterate over each test case and print the expected and actual positions.
