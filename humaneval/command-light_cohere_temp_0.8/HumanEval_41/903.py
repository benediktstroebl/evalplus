```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. Each car will continue to collide with the opposite-moving car at the same speed. 

    two cars will collision is when the speed of both cars match.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    return: Number of collisions with the cars.
```
This function accepts an integer parameter `n` representing the number of cars involved in the race. It simulates the movement of n cars driving on the road, where some cars are driving in opposite directions. The function then determines if there are any collisions based on the cars' speeds and directions. It then outputs the number of collisions that occurred.
