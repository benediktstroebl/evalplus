```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed; two cars heading towards each other will collide
    and move together as a result.
    The function outputs True if two cars were moving in collision, and False otherwise.
    """
    return n is collisions
```

This Python code defines a function called **car_race_collision** which simulates the collision of cars on a straight road. It uses an descriptive, self-contained way to solve the problem of finding the number of collisions between two sets of cars driving towards each other on a straight line. The function takes an input **n**, which represents the number of cars on the road, and returns the number of collisions between them. 

This function uses a simple and elegant approach to model the cars' motion and collision on the road.
