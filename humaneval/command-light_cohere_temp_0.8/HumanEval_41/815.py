Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    As two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    Returns the count of collisions.
"""
    # Assume cars' positions and their respective velocities
    left_cars = [(0, 0)] * n
    right_cars = [(0, n*speed),] * n

    # Define the set of collisions
    collisions = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if left_cars[i][0] > right_cars[j][0]:
                # Check if left car is moving faster than right car
                # Simulate the collision
                left_pos = [left_cars[i][0], left_cars[i][1]]
                right_pos = [right_cars[j][0], right_cars[j][1]]
                colliding_pos = [left_pos[0] + right_pos[0], left_pos[1] + right_pos[1]]
                # Verify if the two cars collide
                if colliding_pos[0] == 0:
                    collisions.append([ij, the final position of the colliding cars)
                    break
                # Reset the position of the colliding cars
                left_cars[i] = [left_pos[0] - speed, left_pos[1]]
                right_cars[j] = [right_pos[0] - speed, right_pos[1] - speed]

    # Return the number of collisions
    return len(collisions)

# Example usage
n = int(input("Enter the number of cars: "))
result = car_race_collision(n)
print("The number of collisions is:", result)
```
This code defines a function called `car_race_collision` that simulates a head-to-head collision between two cars on a straight road. It uses a method of dynamic programming with the concept of "simulating collisions" to determine whether two cars will collide or not. 

Finally, it returns the number of collisions that occurred.
