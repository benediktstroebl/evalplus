This Python script defines a function called **car_race_collision** that simulates a situation where two sets of cars are driving in opposite directions along a straight road. The cars are considered same speed, and they will collide if a car moving right to left hits another moving right to left car. The simulation is based on the assumption that the cars are infinitely strong and will continue moving in their direction after the collision.
