```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed and direction. Two cars are move in the same position and time
    and direction and have the potential to collide. When one car is moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left,
    the collision is registered, but the cars continue moving in their trajectory.
    as if they for every pair of cars that are moving towards each other, a collision is registered.
```

# Test:
n = int(input())
car_race_collision(n)
print("The number of collisions: ", end="")
```
This Python script defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates a car race collision problem. The function takes an input integer n, which represents the number of cars on the road. The cars drive in opposite directions simultaneously and have the potential to collide with each other. The function simulates a collision of two cars if they are in the same position and time, and a collision is registered. The function then continues the simulation, allowing the cars to move in their respective directions. The number of collisions is then outputted to the console.
