```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    As two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
    """.test_collision(n)
    The test_collision function checks if the number of collisions is correct.
```

The above Python script defines a function called `car_race_collision` that takes an integer `n` as input and simulates a race collision between `n` cars on a straight road. The function uses a number of cars to determine the number of collisions between them, and the test_collision function checks if the number of collisions is correct for the given value of `n`.
