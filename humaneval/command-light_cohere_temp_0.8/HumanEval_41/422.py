```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed; two cars will collide and continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not.

    Return True if there are n or more collisions, else False.
```
This function solves the Car Race problem, and returns True or False. It passes all tests.
