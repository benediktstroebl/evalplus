```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    These two of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed, and two cars are going towards each other to collide. The collision is a result of the cars maintaining their trajectory, as if they did not collide.
    Returns number of collisions.
```
This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that takes an integer `n` as input. The function simulates a race of `n` cars on a straight line, where cars are driving towards each other. The function returns the number of collisions between the cars.
