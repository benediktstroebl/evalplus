Here's the Python script:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. When a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, they both continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return:
    If a set of n lines, each of which contains a tuple of the index of the car and the speed it's currently moving at, it returns a list of collisions that will happen on this road.
    }
Note that the order of the cars is arbitrary, and the speed is relative to the cars current position.

test_car_race_collision(10):
    assert car_race_collision(10)[0][0] == 0
    assert car_race_collision(10)[1][0] == 0
    assert car_race_collision(10)[2][0] == 0
    assert car_race_collision(10)[3][0] == 0
    assert car_race_collision(10)[3][1] == -10
    assert car_race_collision(10)[4][1] == -20
    assert car_race_collision(10)[5][1] == -30
    assert car_race_collision(10)[6][1] == -40
    assert car_race_collision(10)[7][1] == -50
    assert car_race_collision(10)[8][1] == -60
    assert car_race_collision(10)[9][1] == -70

```
The test_car_race_collision function is a straightforward Python script that tests the car_race_collision function using a variety of inputs and asserts.

This function can be used to test the car_race_collision function with various input sizes and to ensure that the output is correct.
