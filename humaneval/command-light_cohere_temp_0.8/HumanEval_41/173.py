```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed; 
    two cars will collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    Return: the number of collisions.

    Test to be determined the test case with a collision, 
    and return the number of collisions. 
```
This function accepts an integer n as input, which represents the number of cars in the race. The function creates two lists to simulate the cars on the road: one for cars driving left to right and one for cars driving right to left. The function then checks if the first car driving right to left hits the first car driving left to right, and if so, it checks if the second car driving right to left hits the first car driving right to left. The function then checks if the second car driving right to left hits the second car driving left to right, and so on. The function will output the number of cars that have collided with each other.
