```python

    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    Two cars want to collide, and it's determined by a set of rules.

```
This Python function, car_race_collision, simulates a car race collision scenario. It takes a time the number of collisions by calculating the sum of products of the car indices and 2 raised to the power of each index (within the range of n cars) and then returns this total. The function handles an input n, which represents the number of cars on the race track. The output is the number of collisions, which simulates the cars hitting each other.
