    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed.
    The two cars are moving towards each other. When a cars that are moving at the same speed towards each other, they will collide.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    The function returns True, indicating that the collision happened.
