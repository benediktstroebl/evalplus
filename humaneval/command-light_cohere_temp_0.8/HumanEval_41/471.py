    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    These two cars are moving at the same speed, two cars will collide and start moving in their original direction again.

    The function outputs True if two cars meet, and False otherwise.
    """
    return True

# Function test:
def test_collision(n: int):
    return car_race_collision(n) == True
```

This function, test_collision, accepts an argument n and tests whether the output of car_race_collision is True. It returns True if two cars collide (meet) and False otherwise.
