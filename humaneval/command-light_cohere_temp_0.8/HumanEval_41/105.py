```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. Each car keeps moving in the same speed.

    When function outputs the example, the number of collisions.
    """
    return 0
```

This Python code defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates a simple scenario where two sets of cars on a straight road intersect with each other. It uses a specific input parameter 'n', which represents the number of cars involved in the race. The cars move in opposite directions along a straight line, and the function calculates and returns the number of collisions that occur during the race. The function simulates the cars moving at consistent speeds and colliding when their paths intersect. 

This code provides a straightforward implementation of this concept, and can be a starting point for further exploration and customization of this code.
