```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. All cars move in the same speed and begin at the same distance from each other. Two cars move to collide, the one moving left to right hits the other moving right to left. As they are infinitely sturdy and strong, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    Returns the number of collisions.
```
The function is a good attempt to solve the problem. However, to pass the corresponding tests, some adjustments would be needed to make the function more complete and readable.
