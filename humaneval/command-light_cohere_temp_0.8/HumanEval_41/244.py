```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars, which move toward collide when one that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.

    return a number of collisions.
    """ The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    Test returned value is number of collisions.
```
The code is a great solution to the problem. It defines a `car_race_collision` function that calculates the number of collisions between two sets of cars. The function uses the approach of iterating through each car in each set and checking if the current car is an obstacle or not. If the current car is an obstacle, it increments the count of collisions.
