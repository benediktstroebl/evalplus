```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. All cars move in the same speed.
    Two cars are collision, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The function outputs the number of the collisions.
```

This Python script defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates a basic physics-based phenomenon - car race collision on an infinitely long road. It takes the scenario where two sets of cars drive towards each other simultaneously. 

The function simulates the collision of two cars, treating them as infinitely strong and able to continue moving after the collision. The outcome is the number of collisions, which depends on the number of cars involved and their relative positions.
