```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. Two cars want to collide
    the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    The function returns True if there is a collision; otherwise, False.
    """
    return collision
```

def test_collision():
    return car_race_collision(4)
```
This function takes an input n, which represents the number of cars on the road. The function then returns True if there is a collision between two cars, otherwise False.

The test_collision function calls the car_race_collision function with an argument 4, which means it will simulate a road with 4 cars. The function then returns the result, which should be True in this case because there are 4 cars and 2 of them will collide. 
This function can be used to test the correctness of the car_race_collision function by passing it a number and checking the returned value.
