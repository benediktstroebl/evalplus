This Python script has a self-contained function called car_race_collision, which simulates the car race collision scenario. The function takes an input of the number of cars (n) and then simulates the collision of these cars on a straight line. The function assumes that cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their respective directions after the collision. The function outputs the number of collisions that occurred in the collision.
