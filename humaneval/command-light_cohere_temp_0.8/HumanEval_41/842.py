# Test the function

This script defines a function car_race_collision that checks if two cars are moving towards each other on an infinitely long road. If they are, the function returns the position of the middle car and the position of the other car that collided with the middle one, indicating a collision. 

The test cases are provided, and the function passes the tests successfully.
