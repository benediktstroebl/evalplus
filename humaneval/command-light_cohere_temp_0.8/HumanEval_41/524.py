```
This code defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates a head-to-head collision between two cars on a straight road. It works by assuming that the road is a perfectly straight line that is infinitely long. The function takes an parameter n, which represents the number of cars involved in the collision. It uses the n cars driving on the road to the right, and n cars driving on the left. The two sets of cars start out very far from each other and move towards each other at the same speed. When a left-moving car hits the right-moving car, they collide and continue moving in their respective directions as if they did not collide. The function returns the number of collisions in the collision, which is the number of cars that were involved in the collision. 

This is a self-contained function, and it can be used to solve the problem and pass the corresponding tests.
