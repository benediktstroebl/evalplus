This Python code defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision scenario. The function takes an input parameter `n` representing the number of cars on the road. The cars are driving in opposite directions, and the function determines if a collision occurs based on their relative positions. The cars are infinitely strong and the function continues their motion without collisions. The code also provides a test function `test_car_race_collision` with a list of input and expected output values for the `car_race_collision` function. The test function runs the results are then printed, showcasing the successful comparison of the function's outputs against the expected values.
