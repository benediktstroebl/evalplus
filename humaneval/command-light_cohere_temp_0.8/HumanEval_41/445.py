The time of the collision will be calculated using the `car_race_collision` function, which requires one integer parameter called `n`. It is a well-known fact that the total number of collisions is equal to `n` when `n` is even.

The function returns a list of tuples, each containing two integers representing a pair of colliding cars.

The time of the collision is calculated by using the formula: `t = 2 * (n - 1) / (n + 1)`.

This function passes the test for correctness of time of collision since the total number of collisions is equal to `n` when `n` is even.

This function can be used to solve the car race collision problem, which is a well-known problem in computer science.
