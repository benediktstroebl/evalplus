```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed. Two cars are collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
This Python code defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates a car race collision scenario. The function takes an integer n as input, representing the number of cars participating in the race. The function creates a scenario of two sets of n cars, with one set driving left to right and the other driving right to left. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so when a car from the first set hits a car from the second set, they continue moving along their respective trajectories as if no collision had occurred.

The function outputs the number of collisions that occurred during the race.
