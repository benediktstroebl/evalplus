    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed, and two cars will collide as described.
    When two cars that are moving in opposite directions collide and continue moving along their common line.

This Python function called "car_race_collision" simulates a car race collision scenario on an infinitely long straight road. It takes a scenario, the function takes an integer n as input, which represents the number of cars participating in the race. The cars start out from rest positions, and when two cars move towards each other on opposite sides of the road, they collide. After the collision, both cars continue moving along the same line at the same speed as if nothing happened.

The function simulates the collision of two cars moving towards each other on opposite sides of the road. It defines a collision as the cars moving in opposite directions collide and continue moving along the same line, both moving at the same speed after the collision.

The function calculates and outputs the number of collisions that occur during the race. It assumes that the cars are infinitely strong and will continue moving along their common line after the collision. 

This function is self-contained and can be used to solve the problem of car race collisions in a markdown code block.
