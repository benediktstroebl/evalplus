    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. Each car moves in the same speed.

This Python script defines a function car_race_collision that simulates a car race collision scenario. The function takes an integer n as input, representing the number of cars on the road. The cars are represented as lists of integers, where each integer corresponds to a car's position on the road. The cars are initially placed far from each other, and they start moving towards each other simultaneously. 

The script then creates two lists of integers: one representing the cars driving right to left and another representing the cars driving left to right. The cars are then combined into a single list of integers using the list comprehension map. The two lists are then split apart using the set_difference function, which returns the elements that are in the second list but not in the first list. 

The cars are then placed on the road and ready to collide. The function returns the list of cars, which represent the two cars that are on the road and ready to collide.
