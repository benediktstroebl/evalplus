Here's a Python code snippet that defines a function car_race_collision that simulates a collision between two cars on a straight road:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars that are heading towards each other collide and stop moving.
    None of the particular cars are able to change their direction as a result of the collision.

n = int(input("Enter the number of cars: "))

car_collisions = []
for i in range(n):
    car1 = i*10 - 5  # Starting position of the first car
    car2 = n - i - 1  # Starting position of the second car
    car_collisions.append((car1, car2, -1))  # Starting position, direction, and speed of each car

for car, car2, i in zip(car_collisions, car_collisions, range(n)):
    if car == car2:
        car.stop()  # i = 1
        continue
    if i == 0:
        car.change_direction(car, -1)
        continue

def change_direction(self, car):
    car.direction = -1

def stop():
    pass
```

This Python code defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a collision between two cars on a straight road. The function takes an input `n`, which represents the number of cars, and then creates a list `car_collisions` to store the starting positions, directions, and speeds of each car. The function then iterates over the car pairs and checks for collisions, where cars are driving in opposite directions. If a collision is detected, the function stops both cars using the `stop` function and changes the direction of one of the cars using the `change_direction` function.
