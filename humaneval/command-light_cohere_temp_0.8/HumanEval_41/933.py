```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    # All cars move in the same speed; two cars are going toward collision
    # on collision, the cars continue moving along their original
    # direction as if nothing happened.
    return n * number of cars colliding
```

This self-contained Python function, car_race_collision, solves the problem of counting the number of cars colliding on a straight road that's infinitely long. The cars driving in opposite directions are treated as "colliding" and the result is the number of cars that did collide. The function returns the number of collisions, which is the desired output of this problem.
