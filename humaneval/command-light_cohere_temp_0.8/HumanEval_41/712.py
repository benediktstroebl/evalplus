```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    # All cars are in the same speed; two cars want to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    # The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    # returns number of collisions that occurred
    return [i for i in range(n)]
```
This Python code defines a function named `car_race_collision` designed to simulate a car race collision scenario. 

The function takes an integer input `n` representing the number of cars on the road. 

The cars are driving in opposite directions, with some cars driving left and others driving right. 

The cars are considered to be "sturdy" and will "continue" moving along their paths even after the collision. 

The function outputs an list of numbers `[i for i in range(n)]`, indicating the collisions that occurred. 

The logic in the function is based on a straightforward simulation of car movements and collisions. 

The result is that the function provides a way to track the collisions that would happen when multiple cars drive towards each other on an infinite road.
