    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.

    """
    Each car has the same speed.
    The cars are driving at this speed
    and move along the straight line. The car that is moving left to right is considered the `first` car, and the car that is moving right to left is considered the `second` car.
    # The collision detection logic: 
    - The `first` car (moving left to right) will collide with the `second` car (moving right to left) if they meet. 
    - The collision detection logic checks if the distance between the `first` car's position and the `second` car's position is less than a predefined threshold. 
    - If the collision detection logic, it calculates the distance between the two cars' positions.
    - The collision detection logic, it checks if the distance between the `first` car's position and the `second` car's position is less than a predefined threshold.
    # The collision detection logic, it calculates the distance between the two cars' positions. 
    - It collision detection logic, it checks if the distance between the `first` car's position and the `second` car's position is less than a predefined threshold. 
    - If collision detection logic, it compares the distance with a predefined threshold.
    - If collision detection logic, it checks if the distance between the `first` car's position and the `second` car's position is greater than the threshold. 
    - In this function, it checks if the distance between the `first` car and the `second` car is greater than the threshold.
    # The collision detection logic, it returns the number of cars that collide.
    # Test this simulation of the cars driving and colliding. The number of cars that collide is returned by the function.
