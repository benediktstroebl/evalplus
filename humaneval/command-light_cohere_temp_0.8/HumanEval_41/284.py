Here's the Python code:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. Each car moves in uniform speed
    The cars will collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    The two cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return: 
    collisions = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if i == j: continue
            else:
                # Assuming cars are infinitely strong and will continue moving
                collisions += 1
    return collisions
```
The function calculates the number of collisions when n cars of different speeds drive towards each other along a straight line. The loop of adjacent cars running in opposite directions with no collision will result in the absence of collisions.
