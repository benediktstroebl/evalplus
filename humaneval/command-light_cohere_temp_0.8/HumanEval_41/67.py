The provided code defines a function car_race_collision that simulates a race collision between n cars on a straight road. 

The function takes an integer n as input, representing the number of cars on the road. 
It uses a simple case where two cars with identical speeds and starting positions will collide, and the other cars will continue moving along their trajectories. 
The function outputs n, which represents the number of collisions that occur in the race.
