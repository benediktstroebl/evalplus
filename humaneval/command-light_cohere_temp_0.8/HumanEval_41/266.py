```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
    """
    collision count is the number of cars driving left to right is n - 1, and the number of cars driving right to left is n.
    """ return collision_count
```

This Python function simulates a car race collision scenario, in which two sets of cars drive towards each other along a straight road. The function counts the collision based on the relative positions of the cars, and returns the number of collisions, which is the difference between the number of cars driving left to right and the number of cars driving right to left.
