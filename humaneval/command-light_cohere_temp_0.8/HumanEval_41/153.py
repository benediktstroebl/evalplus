```python

    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars have theThe same speed. Two cars moving to collide will when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

This Python script defines a function called **car_race_collision** that simulates a road race collision scenario. The function takes an integer **n** as input, which represents the number of cars involved in the race. The function simulates the collision of **n** cars driving in opposite directions and returns the count of collisions that occur. The function models a collision as the vehicles are infinitely strong, and the cars continue moving along their respective trajectories, as if they did not collide. 

This self-contained function can be easily incorporated into other scripts or used directly to solve the problem of counting the number of collisions in a given scenario.
