```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. All cars move in same same speed.  Two cars aread in the same speed and direction to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return (n + m) // 2 * (n - m + 1)

This Python script defines a function car_race_collision that calculates the number of collisions between n cars driving left and m cars driving right. The function takes two input arguments, n and m, representing the number of cars driving left and right, respectively. When you call this function, it returns the number of collisions between these sets of cars. 

The driver cars input section prompts the user to enter the number of cars driving left and right. The program then calculates the collisions using the car_race_collision function and displays the result.

Please note that the code assumes that the cars are infinitely strong and do not suffer any impact from the collision.
