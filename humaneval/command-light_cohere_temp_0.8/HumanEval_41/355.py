```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed.
    The function outputs the number of the collisions.
``` 
This Python function simulates a head-to-head car collision scenario. It takes the specific car scenario, where n cars are driving simultaneously along a straight line. 

The cars are moving in opposite directions with the same speed. 

When the left-moving car hits the right-moving car, the collision occurs. The cars are infinitely strong, so they continue moving along their original trajectories. 

This function calculates the number of collisions based on the number of cars (n) and passes the test of a collision, given a set of n cars driving along the straight line.
