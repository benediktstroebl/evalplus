    function takes a car as a parameter and compares it with the other cars in
        the list.
    level:
        First, we need to check if the car is in the hanging out state. If a car is moving right, we return False. If the car is in the hanging out state, we check if there is another car
        in the same state. If we find another car, we return True. If we do not find another car, we return False.

cars = [1, 2, 3, 4]
result = check_collisions(cars)
print(result)
```
This Python code defines a function `check_collisions` that determines if any vehicles are currently hanging out, which indicates a collision. The function takes an list of vehicles as input and compares each car with the other vehicles to check for hanging out. If any vehicle is in this state, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The code then demonstrates the function by creating a list of four vehicles, and the `check_collisions` function is called with this list. The function returns `True` because all vehicles are in the hanging out state, and the result is printed, which outputs `True`.
