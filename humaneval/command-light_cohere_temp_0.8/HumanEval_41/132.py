```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars have the scenario, where two cars are heading towards collision on the road.

    The function uses a `np` formula to determine the number of collisions: It calculates the sum of the products of the speeds of the left and right cars, which is then halved to account for the safety factor. The safety factor is then added to the speeds to determine the final speed.

    The function then checks if the final speed is less than 0, which means that the cars are moving too slowly to collide. 

The function then checks if the number of left cars is greater than the number of right cars, which means that the left cars are going faster. The function then returns the number of collisions, which is the number of cars that are going faster than the other set of cars.
