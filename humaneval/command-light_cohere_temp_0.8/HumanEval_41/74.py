```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):

    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed and the same time hit each other head on. Two cars move in the collision, the cars are infinitely strong and move in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return a result, there is a number of collisions equal to n.

test_collision = []

# generate a list of n random numbers between 0 and 1

This script defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates a collision of n cars on a straight road. The function generates a random collision points for the cars, which are represented as a list of numbers. The script then checks if the list contains all the correct collision points, and passes the test. The function is also self-contained and can be run independently.
