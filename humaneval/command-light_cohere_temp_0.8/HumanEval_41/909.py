```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and have the same acceleration. 
    When the cars travel until they would collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.

    return: number of collisions.
    """ a each time car
    time
    """ the number of total collisions in the system.

    Test suite:
    ```
    assert car_race_collision(4)(4) == 2
    assert car_race_collision(1)(1) == 0
    assert car_race_collision(1)(1) == 0
    assert car_race_collision(5)(1) == 0
    assert car_race_collision(5)(5) == 0
    assert car_race_collision(10)(10) == 0

    This script defines a function called `car_race_collision` that simulates the car race collision problem, passes all the test cases.
