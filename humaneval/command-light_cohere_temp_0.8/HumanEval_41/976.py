Here's the code:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars will moving into each other on the road.
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. They are both infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    This function outputs the the number of collisions.
```
This code defines a function that simulates a car race collision scenario, where two sets of cars are driving in opposite directions on a straight road and collide with each other. The code assumes the cars are infinitely strong and do not come to a complete stop, but continue moving along their respective trajectories.
