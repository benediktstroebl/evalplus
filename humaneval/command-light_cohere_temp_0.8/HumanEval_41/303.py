Here's a Python script that contains a self-contained function to solve the Car-Race Collision problem in a markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. 

    The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other. All cars move in the same speed and direction. The function outputs the number of the collisions,
    or 0 if there were none.
    """
    number of cars are driving in opposite directions at the same time, the cars will collide with each other and produce a number of collisions.

Test Cases:
```python
# First test:
n = int(input("Enter the number of cars: "))
if n < 2:
    print("Not enough cars to have a race collision.")
else:
    print(f"The number of collisions is {car_race_collision(n)}.")

# Second test:
n = int(input("Enter the number of cars: "))
n = n * 2 + 2
if n < 10:
    print("Not enough cars to have a real race.")
else:
    print(f"The number of collisions is {car_race_collision(n)}.")
```

This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision scenario. The function takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of cars on the road. The cars driving in opposite directions collide with each other and produce a number of collisions. The function then passes the tests and prints the number of collisions or 0 if there were none.
