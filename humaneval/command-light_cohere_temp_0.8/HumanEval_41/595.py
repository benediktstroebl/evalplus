```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. Each car continues moving in the same speed, and
    without collision, they keep moving along their trajectory.

    This function checks for this collisions by comparing the positions of the cars and returns the number of collisions.
```
This script defines a function that simulates a car race collision problem. The cars are moving towards each other, and the function checks for collisions by comparing their positions. The function then returns the number of collisions.
