```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. All cars move in the same speed, and 
    two cars want to collide. The first car moving right to left hits the second 
    car moving right to left. When two cars are of equal speed, 
    they will collide without a major accident, and continue moving 
    in their trajectory.

    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
This function defines a scenario of cars moving on a straight road, where some cars are driving towards the left and some are driving towards the right. It then simulates the collision between these cars, taking into account that they are infinitely strong and will continue moving in their original direction even after a collision. The function determines if there is a collision between the cars and returns the number of collisions.
