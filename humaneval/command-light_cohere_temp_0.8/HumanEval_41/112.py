```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 

    two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed; two cars will collide and then they will continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not. 

    function outputs the different between 0 and n.
 ```
def test_collision(n: int):
    return car_race_collision(n) == n
```

This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates the collision of n cars on a straight road. It then defines a test function `test_collision` that is used to verify if the `car_race_collision` function is working correctly.
