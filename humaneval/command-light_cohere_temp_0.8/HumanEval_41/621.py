```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed.
    Two cars are that are moving collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
The above code defines a function car_race_collision that simulates a head-to-head collision between two cars on a straight road. It takes a time n to simulate the cars driving towards each other. It creates two pairs of cars, each moving in opposite directions and with the same speed. It then checks for a collision between the two cars, and if a collision is detected, it counts it and continues moving both cars in their respective directions. 

The code is self-contained, and does not require any external functions or variables.
