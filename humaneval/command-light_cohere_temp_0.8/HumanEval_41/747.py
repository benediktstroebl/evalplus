```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and direction.
    Two cars move in opposite directions collide and stop moving, as if they did not collide. The result is that all the cars continue moving in their original direction without changing their trajectories.

    Returns: number of collisions
    """
    If two cars move towards each other simultaneously and are at a collision course, they will collide and then continue moving.
    Return 0 if there are no collisions, 1 if exactly one collision occurred, and 2 if two or more collisions took place.
    """
 number of collisions is the number of cars that stop moving as a result of a collision.
```

The function returns the number of collisions that have occurred. If there are no collisions, the function returns 0. If exactly one collision has occurred, the function returns 1. If two or collisions occurred, the function returns 2.
