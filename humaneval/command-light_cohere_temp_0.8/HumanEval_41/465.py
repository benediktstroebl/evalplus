```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. Two cars will collide and move in the same direction, 
    without stopping. 

    The function outputs the number of collisions.

n = int(input("Enter the number of cars: "))
collisions = 0

# Generate a set of n cars
cars = [list() for i in range(n): list(range(n))[i])

# Iterate through pairs of cars and add collisions
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        if i == j:
            continue
        if cars[i] < cars[j]:
            collisions += 1

# Print number of collisions
print(collisions)
```
This function simulates a race collision between n cars on a straight road. The cars move towards each other, and the function counts the number of collisions. You can change the this input number to run the function and see the number of collisions.
