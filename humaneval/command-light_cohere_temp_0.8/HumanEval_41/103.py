```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. 
    
    Two cars are both in the same speed move forever without collision. 
    
    Return the simple "True" if all cars collide, and "False" otherwise.
    """
return False
``` 
This function uses a boolean value to indicate whether all of the cars have collided.  The function works by returning "False" if the condition for collision is not met.
