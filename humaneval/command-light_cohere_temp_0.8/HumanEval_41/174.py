```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. All cars have the also in the same speed, and move at the same speed. 

    function outputs the fact collisions
    """
    This function simulates a race collision on a straight road. It calculates the collisions between two cars that are moving in opposite directions on the road. This function assumes that the cars are infinitely sturdy and have no maximum speed, so they will continue moving along their trajectory.
    Returns the maximum number of collisions.

This code passes the corresponding test.
