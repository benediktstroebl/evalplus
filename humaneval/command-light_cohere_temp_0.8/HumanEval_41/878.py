```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and move
    in their respective directions indefinitely. A collision occurs when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    After that, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectories as if they did not collide.

    return: 
    A collision is defined as True if there are n cars that are moving right to left and meet at the same time. The function returns True if there are no collisions, otherwise, it returns False.
