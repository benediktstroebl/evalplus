```
This code defines a function named `car_race_collision` that takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of cars on the road. The function simulates a cars moving towards each other and returns the number of collisions that occur. The example usage prompts the number of cars from the user and calculates the number of collisions. The output is then displayed.
