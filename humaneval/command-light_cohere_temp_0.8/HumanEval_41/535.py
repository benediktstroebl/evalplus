```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. Each car moves in the same speed. The first car starts moving right to left and hits the
    second one moving right to left, the first car will continue moving and 
    will not slow down. All the cars are in the same speed, and so, the collision will result in a 
    perfect merging.

    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```

This Python function, car_race_collision, simulates a car race collision scenario with two cars moving in opposite directions along a straight line. The function takes an input parameter n, representing the number of cars involved in the collision. 

The function begins by creating the scenario of two cars moving towards each other along a straight line. The first car is moving to the right, and the second car is moving to the left. 

When the first car reaches the second car, it hits it and continues moving in the same direction, as if there was no collision. 

This behavior is a result of the "infinite strength" of the cars, which means that they will keep moving along their original trajectories even after the collision. 

The function then outputs the number of collisions that occurred in the scenario, which is the number of cars that were moving towards each other and collided.
