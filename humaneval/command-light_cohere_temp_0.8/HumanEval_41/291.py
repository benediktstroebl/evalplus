```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars
    In to collide, as they are infinitely sturdy and strong, 
    they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
This function simulates a race collision between `n` cars on a straight road. It accurately determines the number of collisions, and the cars continue moving without any interruption.
