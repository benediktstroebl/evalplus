```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    As two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and are infinitely sturdy and strong. Two cars that are moving towards each other collide and continue moving in their original direction. This function returns True number of collisions.
```

The function uses a Python list to represent the cars on the road. The leftmost and right cars are represented by the list indices [0] and [1], respectively. The function then loops through the list and checks if the current car is driving towards the car at the index next in the list. The function then adds 1 to the counter if the current car is driving towards the car at the index next in the list.
