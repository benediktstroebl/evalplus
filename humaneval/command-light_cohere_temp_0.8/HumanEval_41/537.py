This script defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates a road with cars driving on it. It creates a scenario of cars moving towards each other, colliding, and continuing to move after the collision. The function returns the number of collisions, which increases with the minimum of the input 'n' and 5. 

The provided usage demonstrates how to call the function with a number of cars and then prints the number of collisions. This script is a time to be used to simulate the car race collision scenario.
