```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. 
    When two cars intended to collide meet in the same spot at the same time. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    Returns the number of collisions.
```
This code defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a head-to-head collision between n cars on a straight road. It uses a scenario of two sets of cars moving towards each other on a straight line, with the possibility of a collision if the cars meet in the same spot at the same time. The cars are represented to be "infinitely" strong and would "continue moving" in their respective directions after the collision, as if they did not collide.
