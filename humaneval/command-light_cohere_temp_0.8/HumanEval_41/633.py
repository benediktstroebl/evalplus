```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    All cars have in same speed.
    Two cars meet the time collide
    and continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.

return_collisions = car_race_collision(5)  # example, 5 cars in the race
print(f'Number of collisions: {_collisions})
```
This code defines a function car_race_collision that simulates a race collision event. It takes the scenario where two sets of cars drive towards each other on a straight road, and when one car moving right hits another moving left, they collide and continue moving in the same direction. The number of collisions is returned as output.
