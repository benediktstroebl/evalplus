```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    As two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars will meeting in the collision
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    Returns: number of collisions.
```
This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates the collision of two cars on a straight road. The cars move towards each other at a constant speed and collide if they meet, with the result that both cars continue moving along their original paths. The function returns the number of collisions, which corresponds to the number of cars that were moving towards each other.
