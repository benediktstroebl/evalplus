```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 

    function outputs number of the collisions
    that result. 

    The function assumes that all cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, 
    so they continue moving in their respective trajectories after colliding. 
    Returns: number of moving cars that are still in the lane after the collision, 
    and the number of cars that drove into the lane from the other direction.
    """
return n // number of collisions
```

The code defines a function that simulates the number of cars colliding in a road race scenario. It assumes that there are two sets of cars, moving in opposite directions on a straight line. The function then determines the number of collisions that occur when these cars collide, and it returns the number of cars that are still moving in each direction after the collision. This simulates the collision as a cars are infinitely strong and continue moving in their respective directions.
