    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 

    two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed.
    The two cars intended to collide meet and stop moving, instead, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

The function uses nested loops to simulate the collision of n cars driving towards the right and n cars driving towards the left. 

This function is a self-contained simulation and passes the corresponding test of solving the problem.
