```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed.
    Two cars will the run into each other at the same time, the function outputs the number of collisions.

"""
    The car that is moving left to right and the car that is moving right to left start out at the same time from each other.
    The time of collision is determined by the position of the two cars. The function then detects when the cars collide, and then the two cars continue moving in the same direction.

If you want to test the function, you can uncomment the test cases after the function.

```python
import math
# n = int(input("Enter the number of cars: "))
# car_race_collision(n)
# print(f"Car race collision: {print(n, "cars driving left to right: ", cars_left_to_right)}
# print(f"Car race collision: {print(n, "cars driving right to left: ", cars_right_to_left)}

# cars_collide = car_race_collision(int(input("Enter the number of cars: ")))
# print(f"There {0} collisions.")
```

This script defines a function called car_race_collision that takes an integer n as input. It represents a scenario of two sets of cars, moving in opposite directions on a straight road. The two sets of cars start out from the same position, and the function determines when and how they collide. The script then provides test cases for the function to solve the problem and demonstrate the functionality.
