```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed, and two cars will collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```

This Python function simulates a car race collision scenario. It takes a input n, which represents the number of cars involved in the race. The function creates two sets of cars, with each set driving in opposite directions along a straight line. It then checks for collisions between the two cars. If a cars collide, the function keeps track of the number of collisions and outputs this count.

The code is self-contained, and doesn't rely on any external functions or modules. It can be used as a solution to the problem statement you provided.
