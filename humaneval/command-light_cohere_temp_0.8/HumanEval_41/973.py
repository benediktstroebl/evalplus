```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other. All cars have the goal of moving into a collision, where a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    Once the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

```
This Python code defines a function called "car_race_collision" that simulates a collision between two sets of cars on a straight road. It uses the parameter "n" to represent the number of cars involved in the collision. The function returns the result the number of collisions that occur.
