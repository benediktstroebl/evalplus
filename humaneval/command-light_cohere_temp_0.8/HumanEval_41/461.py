This script defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates a car race collision. It uses nested loops to represent a scenario where two sets of cars move towards each other along a straight road. The function compares the two cars' y coordinates and determines if they have collided. If the cars are moving towards each other, a collision is registered. The function returns True to represent the collision status of each pair of cars.

Finally, the code tests the function car_race_collision(5) with 5 cars, which should produce True as a result, demonstrating that the cars have collided.
