```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. Each car moves in the same speed. 
    Two cars are collision: The cars do not intersect, and each car continues moving
    in its own direction.
    The output is True if there was a collision, and False otherwise.
    """
```
This script defines a function car_race_collision that simulates a car race collision scenario. It takes a example with n = 3, and prints whether a collision happened or not. The function returns True if all cars would collide (they are driving towards each other from opposite directions), and False otherwise.
