```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars will meeting in the collision and continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return:
    the number of collisions between left-driving cars and right-driving cars is 2n.
    """
   
This code creates the function `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision event. It calculates the number of collisions between cars that are driving left to right and cars that are driving right to left. This number is the output is the number of collisions, which is calculated as `2n`.

This code is self-contained and does not require any additional Python scripts or external functions to be executed.
