```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. Two cars meet which the either set collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return:
    A list of collisions is returned, where each collision is a tuple containing the index of the car that was moving left to right and the index of the car that was moving right to left.

test_car_race_collision(5)
