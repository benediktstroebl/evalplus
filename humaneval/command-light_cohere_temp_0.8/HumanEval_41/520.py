    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.

This Python script defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision scenario. It takes a scenario where a road is represented as a perfectly straight, infinitely long line. 

The cars are represented by two sets, moving in opposite directions along the road. 

The function takes an argument `n` representing the number of cars in the race. 

The cars are moving at the same speed, and the function calculates the number of collisions and outputs the result. 

The test case passes several tests to the `car_race_collision` function.  It checks that the number of collisions is correct for different values of `n`, and also checks that the function returns 0 for an empty set of cars (i.
