```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. Each car will move at the provided speed and collide
    when moving into the path of an opponent. A car that's moving right to left hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return: 

   number of collisions = any positive integer
    collisions = [i for i in range(n)]
    for i, coll in enumerate(collisions):
        coll[i] = coll[i] + 1 if coll[i] == 0 else coll[i] -1
    return collisions
```
This code implements a function called `car_race_collision` that simulates the movement of cars on a road and their collisions. The cars move in opposite directions on a straight line, and their collisions are simulated by incrementing or decrementing the collision count for each pair of cars.

The function returns a list of collision counts, which represent the number of times each car has collided with its opponent.
