```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and move in their respective direction without collision. 

    number of collisions between the cars is determined by the number of cars.
```
This function simulates a car race scenario, with n cars driving towards each other. It ensures that each car moves in its designated direction and doesn't collide with any other car. The number of collisions between cars is calculated and returned.
