```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    Two cars meet to collide. each are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return:  All cars move in the same speed
    collisions = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            # Determine if the cars collide
                if i == j:
                    continue
                if abs(i[0] - j[0]) < 10: # cars are close enough to collide
                    collisions += 1

    return collisions

# Example usage:
n = int(input("Enter the number of cars: "))
result = car_race_collision(n)
print("Number of collisions:", result)
```
The function car_race_collision calculates the number of collisions between two sets of n cars driving towards each other on an infinitely long road. The function works by using nested loops to iterate over all possible combinations of cars and then checks if the cars are close enough to collide (within 10 units) using the abs() function. The function then returns the number of collisions.

Please note that this is a simplified version of the problem and may need further modifications or improvements depending on the specific requirements of your use case.
