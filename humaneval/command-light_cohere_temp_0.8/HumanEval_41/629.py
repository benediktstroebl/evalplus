Here is a Python script that solves the problem of counting cars colliding on a road:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    These two function outputs the fact a list of collisions, where each element is a tuple of the indexes of two cars that collide.

    Here is a set of n cars are driving right to left.
    A collision occurs between the thus driving cars.
    As always moving in a same direction, regardless of which set of cars they are in.
    it.
    Two cars are the o'ne collide with each other
    """

    # Input number of cars on the road
    n = int(input("Enter the number of cars: "))

    # Collision Counter
    collisions = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            # Check if the two cars are moving towards each other
            if (i > j and vehicle_direction(i) == "right" and vehicle_direction(j) == "left"):
                collisions.append([i])

    return collisions

# Function to get the direction a car is moving
def vehicle_direction(index):
    global_vehicle_index = index
    # We assume the car is moving towards the right, so we change the index
    global_vehicle_index -= 1
    return "right"

# Driver the cars according to the function above
def car_driver(index):
    global_vehicle_index = index
    # Driver the cars in the same direction
    vehicle_direction(index)
    return vehicle_direction()

# Driver the first car
car_driver(0)

# Driver the second car
car_driver(1)

# Get the list of collisions
collisions = car_race_collision(2)

# Print the collisions
for collision in collisions:
    print("The cars at indices", collision[0], "and", collision[1])

print("Number of cars that collide: ", len(collisions))
```

This script defines a function called `car_race_collision` that takes an integer n as input, which represents the number of cars on the road. The function returns a list of collisions, where each element is a tuple of the indexes of two cars that collide. The `vehicle_direction` function returns the direction of a car's movement, and the `car_driver` function drives the cars by changing their directions. Finally, the `car_race_collision` function is called with n=2, and the program prints the number of cars that collide and the list of collisions to the console.
