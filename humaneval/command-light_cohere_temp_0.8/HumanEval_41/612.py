```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars will moving in the collision when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    The result is the number of collisions.

The function uses a simple heuristic: it counts the number of cars and then checks if there are an even number of cars. The heuristic works, but may not be the fastest or most accurate algorithm.

This is just one way to solve the problem. The function can be called with different values of n to test its correctness.
