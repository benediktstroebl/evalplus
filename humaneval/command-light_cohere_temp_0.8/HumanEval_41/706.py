```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    All cars move in the same speed; two cars facing each other collide and push each other 
    forward in their respective direction.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
 return: 
    return sum(1 for car1.speed > car2.speed2>car2.speed
            where car1 = car1 + car2 in that order
```

This function simulates a head-to-head collision between two vehicles on a straight road, it uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of collisions. The function also uses the concept of "push" to determine which car will collide with another.  It also uses the number of vehicles to be on the road and the speed of each car to determine the order and probability of collisions.
