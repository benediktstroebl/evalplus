```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed, and two cars will collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    The function returns the number of collisions.

test_collision = car_race_collision(5)
assert test_collision == 10 # Should pass

``` 
This code defines a function that simulates a car race collision scenario. It assumes the scenario where two sets of cars start out very far from each other and move towards each other at the same speed. The cars will collide when they driver goes right and hits the driver going left. After the collision, both cars continue moving in their original directions, following Newton's first law. The code then returns the number of collisions, which represents how many cars have collided. The test_collision function is then called with an argument of 5, and it should return 10, since there are two sets of 5 cars each moving in a direction, so the total number of collisions is 10.
