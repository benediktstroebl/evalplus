    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    Each car moves in the same speed.
    Two cars are collision when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left
    and both cars continue moving in their trajectories.

    The function passes the test if the return value matches the condition.
