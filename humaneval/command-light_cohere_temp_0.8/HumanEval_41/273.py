```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 

    two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and direction. Two cars will collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
This Python script defines a function called `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision scenario. It takes the scenario of two sets of cars driving towards each other on a straight road. The cars are considered to collide and then continue moving in the same direction as if they didn't hit each other. The function calculates the number of collisions and returns the total count. 

This script is a complete self-contained solution for the given problem statement.
