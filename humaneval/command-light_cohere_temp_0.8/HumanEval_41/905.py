```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. All cars move in same same speed. 
    Two cars collide and two cars are moving in opposite directions, they will collide and both cars will keep moving in their respective directions as if they did not touch. 

    function returns the maximum number of collisions.
```

This Python code defines a function `car_race_collision` which simulates a car race collision. The function takes an input `n` which represents the number of cars on the road. The cars are driving in opposite directions and the function returns the maximum number of collisions that will occur. The code also demonstrates the specific behavior of the function by passing the test `10` with the argument `n`.
