```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed and direction. Two cars are collision
    collision when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    return the number of collisions.
    """ are the all function is a simple calculation of the number of collisions.
```
This code is a great start! You can now expand on this and add more functionality to solve the problem and pass more tests.
