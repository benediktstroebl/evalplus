```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 

    two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed.
    The two cars that are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
The function `car_race_collision` simulates a head-to-head collision between two vehicles on a straight road. The function takes an parameter `n` which represents the number of cars involved in the collision. The cars are assumed to be moving in opposite directions along the road. The function simulates the collision by checking if there are two vehicles at an intersection. If this is the case, it returns the number of collisions. The function uses a mathematical approach to model the collision by assuming that the cars are infinitely strong and will continue moving in their direction even after the collision.

The function is designed to be self-contained, meaning that it does not rely on any external functions or classes and can be called directly. It can be easily tested by providing test cases to verify its correctness.
