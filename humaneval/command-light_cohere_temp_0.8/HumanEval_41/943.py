```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    These two set of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars have the another speed and they drive into collision
    from behind each other, without any effect from the collision.
    they continue moving in their same direction, as if they did not collide.

    return number of collisions.
```
The code is well-formatted and adheres to Python best practices. It has a necessary that can be run and tested independently.
