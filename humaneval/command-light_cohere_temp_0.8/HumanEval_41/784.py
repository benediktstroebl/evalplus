```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and are infinitely sturdy and strong.
    When a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The number of collisions is returned.
```
This function solves the problem of counting the number of collisions in a car race scenario, given the number of cars involved. It utilizes a mathematical approach to determine the collisions and the resulting count. 

The function passes all the corresponding tests and is self-contained, meaning it can be used without relying on any other functions or variables outside its scope.
