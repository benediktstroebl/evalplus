```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars that are moving towards each other collide and they continue moving in their original direction. This function outputs True number of collisions.
```
This function is self-contained, which means it can be used to solve the problem and pass all the tests without needing external code.
