This code defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates a head-to-head collision between two cars on a straight road. The function takes an integer n as input, representing the number of cars initially positioned far apart on the road. The cars then start moving towards each other simultaneously, collide head-on, and continue moving in the same direction. 

The output of this code will be the number of collisions.
