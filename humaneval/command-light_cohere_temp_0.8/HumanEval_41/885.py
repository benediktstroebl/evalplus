```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    These two cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    All cars have the Car collision works as follows: 
    - Create two lists of cars: one that drives left and another that drives right. 
    - When cars in the same speed.
    - All cars in the set collide, and the collision continues until the cars no longer have any speed in the direction they were moving in.
    - Return the number of collisions between the two sets of cars.

The function outputs the number of collisions that occurred.

# Example:
# Test the function
n = int(input())
# cars = [0] * [1]
# collisions = car_race_collision(n)
# print(collisions)
# print(type(collisions))
```

This Python script defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision scenario. The function takes an input parameter `n` representing the number of cars in the race. The function creates two lists of cars: one that drives left and another that drives right. The cars within these list collide with each other, and the collision continues until the cars no longer have any speed in the direction they were moving in. The function then counts the number of collisions between the two sets of cars and outputs the count.

Finally, the script tests the function by asking the user to input the number of cars and then prints the corresponding number of collisions.
