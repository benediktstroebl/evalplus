```

The above Python script defines a function car_race_collision, which simulates a head-to-head collision between two cars on a straight road. The function takes an input of the number of cars (n) and uses a mathematical approach to calculate the time it takes for the cars to collide. The function then returns a number of steps it takes for the cars to collide.

The script also includes a function collision_time, which calculates the time it takes for the cars to collide using the approach of dividing the sum of the cars' velocities by the number of cars. The function car_race_collision_test uses this collision_time function to check if the cars have collided after a certain number of steps. The example usage section takes an number of cars as input and prints out a message indicating whether the cars have collided or not.
