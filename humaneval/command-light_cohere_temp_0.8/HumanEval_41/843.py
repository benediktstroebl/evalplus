```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed.
    The two cars are moving towards each other. They collide and...both cars continue moving in their trajectory
    as if they did not collide. The function outputs the number of collisions.
```

This code is a simple and effective implementation of a function that solves the car race collision problem and passes the corresponding tests.
