```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed and start out from the same position. 
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so when they collide, they continue moving in their trajectory.

    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```

This function simulates a car race scenario with two sets of cars moving towards each other on a straight road. It calculates the number of collisions between these cars based on their positions and moving directions. The function also handles cases where the cars continue moving without any interruption, even after collisions.

This code is a good implementation of a function that simulates car race collisions and provides the number of collisions as output.
