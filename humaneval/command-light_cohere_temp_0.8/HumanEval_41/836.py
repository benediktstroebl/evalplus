```python

    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    As the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return:
        collisions = 0
        for i in range(n):
            # Starting positions are at different locations
            pos1 = i * (n - 1)
            pos2 = n - pos1 - 1
            # Move positions
            pos1 += 1
            pos2 += -1
            # Check for collision
            if pos1 <= 0 or pos2 >= n:
                collisions += 1
            # Keep moving

This code defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision scenario. The function takes an integer argument `n`, which represents the number of cars in the race. It uses a concept of a straight road with cars moving towards each other and checks if the positions of the cars have reached the boundaries of the road, simulating a collision. The function counts the collisions and returns the number of collisions that occurred.
