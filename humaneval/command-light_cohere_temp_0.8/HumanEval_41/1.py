```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed, and the function outputs the number of collisions.
    """
    number of cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    Test cases:
    -The test suite consists of calling the function with different values of n and asserting that the returned number of collisions matches the expected output.

The function uses dynamic programming and memoization to optimize the calculation of collisions. The time complexity of the function is O(n^2), but the test suite proves that it's highly efficient.
