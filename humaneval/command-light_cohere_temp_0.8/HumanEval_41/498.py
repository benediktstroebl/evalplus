```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    # Two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars that are moving towards each other collide and continue moving in their respective directions as if they did not collide. The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
This function is self-contained and provides a solution to the problem of finding the number of collisions between two sets of cars on a straight road.
