This Python script defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a head-on car collision on a straight road. It requires an input of the number of cars and checks if there are enough cars to have a collision. The `main` function then calls the `car_race_collision` function and passes the test. 

This script is self-contained and can be executed directly, providing a straightforward way to model and solve car collisions in a simple environment.
