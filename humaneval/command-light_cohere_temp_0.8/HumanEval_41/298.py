```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed. 
    Two cars are move in the same direction and speed to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```

def test_car_race_collision():
    assert car_race_collision(5) == 4
    assert car_race_collision(10) == 6
    assert car_race_collision(3) == 3

```
This script defines a function called **car_race_collision** that simulates a road with two lanes of cars moving towards each other. It determines the time two cars collide based on their direction and speed.

The function then provides test cases to ensure the correctness of the function by checking whether the output of the function is equal to the expected number of collisions.

This self-contained solution can be used as a base to build more complex and advanced code for simulating a car race collision scenario.
