```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars moving to collide will meet their conditions that both are moving on the same side of the road. 
	

    Here, the function outputs the number of collisions.

test_car_race_collision(5):
    assert car_race_collision(5) == 2
