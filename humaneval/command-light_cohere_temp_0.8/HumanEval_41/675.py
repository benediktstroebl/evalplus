```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. Two cars are collide and continue moving in their trajectory.
    # Determine if a two cars are approaching collision
    if abs(n * car1[0] - car2[0]) < threshold:
        return 1 + car_race_collision(min(n, 2))
    # Return the number of collisions
    return sum( [1 + car_race_collision(i) for i in range(n)])

# Test the function with n = 4 and threshold = 0.0
print(car_race_collision(4))
 ```

The function determines if two cars are approaching a collision by comparing their speeds. If they collide, the function returns 1 + the number of collisions that occur. The function also returns the number of collisions that occur.
