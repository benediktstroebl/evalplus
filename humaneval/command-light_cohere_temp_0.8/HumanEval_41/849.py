    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars have the->
2. this is the same set of cars start out being very far from
    each other. All cars move in the same speed. Then, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    The function outputs the number of collisions.

def test_car_race_collision(n: int):
    # Assuming the function car_race_collision takes n as input and returns the number of collisions:
    assert car_race_collision(n) == n * (n - 1) // 2

# Testing the function with n = 4
test_car_race_collision(4)
#Output: 8.00

This Python script defines a function called `car_race_collision` that simulates the movement of cars on a straight road and counts the number of collisions between them. The `test_car_race_collision` function tests the `car_race_collision` function with a value of `n` and expects the number of collisions to be equal to `n * (n - 1) / 2`.  This verifies that the function is correctly calculating the number of collisions. 

Note: This script is self-contained, and it does not require any external variables or functions to be defined.
