This function accepts an integer n, which indicates the quantity of cars. The function returns the number of collisions, which is the total number of cars that have driven into one another. In this instance, the function uses a list comprehension to identify the cars that have collided. The cars are those that have driven into each other and have less than one rotation in their path.
