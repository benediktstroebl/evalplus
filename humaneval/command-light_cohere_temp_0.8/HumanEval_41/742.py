```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars have the platform that they move on the road.
    The function outputs the number of the collisions.
    """

def test_car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n > 2 

# Example usage
n = int(input("Enter the number of cars: "))
print(test_car_race_collision(n))
``` 
This code defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a road with n cars, and counts the number of collisions between them. The `test_car_race_collision` function tests if the given number of cars is greater than 2. 

This code is self-contained and does not require any additional modules or external functions. It can be used as an standalone solution to the problem of counting car collisions in a race scenario.
