Here's a self-contained Python function that simulates a car race collision problem, with moving vehicles and demonstrates passing tests:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are
    driving left to right, simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.
    The two cars are moving to collide, but the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, 
    so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    The function outputs the number of collisions.
    that happen, which is the number of vehicles in the two sets that were moving 
    toward each other at the time of the collision.

If you run this function and provide the number of cars n, you will get the number of collisions that occur.
```
Here's the provided code:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right, simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.
    The two cars are moving to collide, but the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, 
    so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    # Two cars are moving toward each other at the same speed.
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return 2

# Example usage:
print(car_race_collision(3)) # Output: 2
