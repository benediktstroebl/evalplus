```python

    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    As two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and all cars have the same acceleration.
    Two cars intended to collide meet any time t_collision_start_time and start_position.
    They will one car move to the other's position and collide. After the collision, both continue moving in their original direction.

    number of collisions = 1

Does this solve the problem?
