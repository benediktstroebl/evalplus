```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    They all move in the same speed. 
    Two cars are collision, they would meet head-to-head on the road.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
    return collisions //
    return sum(2 ** n - 1)
