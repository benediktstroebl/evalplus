    the number of cars on the road, we can use a simple formula to estimate the number of collisions.

Let's say n represents the number of cars on the road. The probability of a left-driving car colliding with the right-driving car is (n/2), assuming that they are equally distributed along the road. 

This probability will be multiplied by the fact that the two cars are moving towards each other, which will result in a collision. 

The formula for the number of collisions is:
 (n/2) * (1/2)

This formula will result in a number of collisions that is equal to the product of the two fractions.
