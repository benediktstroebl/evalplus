Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the car race collision problem:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. 
    Two cars are collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
This Python code defines a function called `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision. It takes a specific scenario where multiple cars move towards each other along a straight road. 

The code uses a descriptive and functional approach. The function takes an single parameter `n`, which represents the number of cars on the road. The cars are driving in opposite directions, with some cars moving to the right and others moving to the left. 

The code then defines a set of collisions based on the relative positions of the cars. The cars are assumed to be infinitely strong and durable, so they continue moving in their respective directions after the collision event. The function then outputs the number of collisions that have occurred, which is determined by the number of cars that have collided with each other. 

The function is well-contained, and it can be used to simulate and analyze car races with different numbers of cars.
