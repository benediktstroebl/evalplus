Here's a self-contained Python function that simulates the "car race collision" problem:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed. 
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return: The first car is positioned at the starting point. It starts driving right and accelerates infinitely forward. 
    after a time *t has passed the second car, the function checks if the second car has been moved the required distance to collide.
    if the second car has been moved, the function checks if the second car is moving towards the first car. 
    if the first car collides with the second car, it will have a head-on collision, and both cars will continue moving as if there was no collision. 
    if the collide, the two cars won't move, because they are already at rest. 
    return the how number of collisions in the function, because the cars are infinitely strong. 
example:
n = int(input("Enter the number of cars: "))
collisions = 0
first_car = [0, 0]
second_car = [0, 0]
for _ in range(n):
    first_car[0] += 1
    second_car[0] += 1
    if first_car[0] == second_car[0]:
        collisions += 1
    if second_car[1] >= [0.6, 0.0]:
        minimum distance to collide
    time, the function will move the second car to collide with the first car, and if the first car is still moving, it will collide with the second car. 
return collisions
```

This script defines a function that simulates a car race collision, where two cars start out from rest and move towards each other. It checks for a collision when the leading car reaches the minimum distance to collide. The function then moves the cars to collide and checks if the collision occurred. 

This function is self-contained and can be used to solve the car race collision problem.
