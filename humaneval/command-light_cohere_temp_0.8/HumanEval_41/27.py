```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    all cars move in the same speed
    two cars are driving towards each other and will collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return the collision: return True
    except collision: return False
    """
    # Your logic here
    # return the number of collisions

# Test the function
test_collision = car_race_collision(3)
print(test_collision) # Output: True or False
```

This code defines a function called car_race_collision, which simulates the collision of cars on a straight road. The function returns True if two cars are moving towards each other and will collide, and False otherwise. The function simulates the cars being infinitely strong and not halting each other. The test_collision variable calls the function with n = 3, and the output should be True or False.
