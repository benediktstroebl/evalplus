```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and move at the same speed as if they did not collide.

    If a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, the two cars will continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. The function outputs True collisions.

    """
    first test: If two cars start out from the same initial position and are moving towards each other at the same speed, they will collide and produce a head-on collision (also called a first-hitting collision).
```

This function can be used to solve the car race collision problem in markdown code blocks and to pass corresponding tests.
