This Python code defines a function called `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision scenario. It takes the scenario where two sets of cars move towards each other along a straight road. 

The function calculates the number of collisions between these cars and returns either 0 or 1. 

The code then asks the user to input the number of cars and calls the function to simulate the car race collision and print the number of collisions.
