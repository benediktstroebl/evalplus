```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. All cars move in same same speed. Two cars are start colliding if they drive into each other.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    Returns the count of collisions.

return count
