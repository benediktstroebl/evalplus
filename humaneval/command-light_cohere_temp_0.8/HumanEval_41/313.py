```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars will moving to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    Returns the number of collisions.
```

Here's a short breakdown of the code:
1. The function definition for the car race collision. It takes an input parameter n which This number of cars in the race. It simulates an infinitely long road that the cars are driving on, with the cars moving in opposite directions. The cars are considered the same speed and start very far from each other. When the cars moving in opposite directions collide, they continue moving in their original direction as if they did not hit each other.

2. The output of the function is the number of collisions that have occurred. The number of collisions is returned as an integer.

This script is self-contained and can be used to solve the problem of cars colliding on a straight road. The solution is the number of collisions, which is the output of the function.
