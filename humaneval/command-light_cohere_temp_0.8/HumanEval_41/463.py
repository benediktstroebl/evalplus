This Python script defines a function called `car_race_collision` that simulates a collision between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions on a straight road. It generates a random numbers within the range of 0 to 1 and assigns them to `cars_left` and `cars_right` lists. 

Then, it calculates the number of collisions by comparing the elements in `cars_left` and `cars_right` lists and returns the result. 

Finally, it passes the function with 10 cars and asserts that the expected number of collisions is 5, which is the result of 5 collisions between the cars.
