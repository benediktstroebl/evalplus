Here's the code:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed; two cars meet in the middle and collide.
    The function outputs the number of the collisions.
#The function simulates a car race with a set of vehicles moving toward each other on a straight road.
#The 'cars_moving' list is a set of vehicles, with each vehicle driving in the same direction (either left or right).
#The 'collisions' list is initialized to keep track of which vehicles have collided.
#The 'i' variable keeps track of the current position of each vehicle
#The function uses a while loop to check if the current vehicle is moving in the correct direction and has reached the other vehicle
#If the current vehicle is moving in the correct direction, the function checks if the current vehicle has reached the other vehicle.
#If it has, the two vehicles are considered to have collided, and the 'collisions' list is updated to keep track of the collisions
#If the current vehicle is not moving in the correct direction, the function moves the current vehicle until it starts moving in the right direction.
#Finally, the function outputs the number of collisions.
n = 10 # Set the desired number of vehicles
for i in range(n):
    vehicles.append(i)
for i in range(n):
        vehicles[i].direction = vehicles[i].direction == "left" and vehicles[i].speed = 1
collisions = []
for i in range(n):
    if vehicles[i].direction == "right":
        for j in range(n):
            if vehicles[i].speed == vehicles[j[j].speed:
                if j not in collisions:
                    collisions.append(j)
print(len(collisions))
```

This code defines a function `car_race_collision` that solves the car race collision problem. It takes a scenario where two cars move towards each other on a straight road. The function keeps track of the vehicles' direction and speed, and when two vehicles meet, they collide. The function then counts the number of collisions and returns the total count.
