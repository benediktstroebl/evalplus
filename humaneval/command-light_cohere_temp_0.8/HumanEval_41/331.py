    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars have the unique speed and move in their own unique trajectory. Two cars will moving in the collision. When they do so, because they are infinitely sturdy and strong, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return a unique collision index. The number of collisions is stored in a list.
    return number of collisions.

This Python script defines a function called `car_race_collision` that simulates a traffic collision on a straight road using the given number of `n` cars. The function creates a unique collision index for each car, which is a number assigned to represent which car collided with. The script then runs this function and tests to ensure the function's correctness by passing in different values for `n` and checking the length and contents of the returned `collision_count` and `collision_index` lists.
