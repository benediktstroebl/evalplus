    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars moving to collide will be those that are moving in opposite directions and meet each other's minimum distance requirement.

    return the maximum number of collisions, which represents the minimum distance between any two cars.

    ```

The function car_race_collision uses a nested map to create a list of positions of cars on the road. The function then returns the minimum number of collisions, which represents the minimum distance between any two cars. The test passes the car_race_collision with any test.
