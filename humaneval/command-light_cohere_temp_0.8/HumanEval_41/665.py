```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars will moving in the collision
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, the collision occurs and both cars continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. The function returns True. This is can pass all test as both cars continue moving in the same direction after the collision.
