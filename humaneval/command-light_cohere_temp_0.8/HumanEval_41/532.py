```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. All cars have the same same speed. Two cars moving collide when one moving right hits a car that's moving left to right. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return:
    number of collisions.

def test_collision(n: int):
    # Create the two sets of cars
    car1 = [0 for i in range(n)]
    car2 = [0 for i in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        car1[i] = 1 - i
        car2[i] = i + 1

    # Determine if cars are in the right place and moving at the same speed
    for i in range(n):
        if car1[i] == car2[i]:
            return False

    # Check for collisions, which should not happen
    for i in range(n):
        if car1[i] != car2[i]:
            return False

    return True
```
The function car_race_collision takes in a parameter n, which represents the number of cars. The function creates two sets of cars, car1 and car2, each containing n elements. The function then iterates over the car1 and car2 arrays and checks if each element in car1 is equal to the corresponding element in car2. It returns False if any of these conditions are met. The function also returns True if all the conditions are met. The function can be tested by the test_collision function, which creates the two sets of cars and then determines if the cars are in the right place and moving at the same speed.
