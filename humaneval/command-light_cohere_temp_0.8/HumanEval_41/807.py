```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    
    All function outputs whether two cars collide, or not. 

    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    """

    return n % 2
```

This Python function solves the Car Race Collision problem, which determines if two cars moving in opposite directions will collide. The function takes an integer n as input, representing the number of cars on the road. 

The function then returns the number of collisions, which is determined by the cars' movement and strength. 

It uses a simple algorithm to check if the two cars will collide, and returns 1 if they will, and 0 if not.
