```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed, and two cars will collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.

    If two cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. This function outputs the dimemorphous to the 2D car collision case.

test_collisions = []
for i in range(10):
    test_collisions.append(car_race_collision(i))
test_collisions = sorted(test_collisions,key=lambda x:x[0])

print(test_collisions)
