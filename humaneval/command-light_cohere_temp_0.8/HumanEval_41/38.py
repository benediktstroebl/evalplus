    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    These two cars are in the same speed and maintain their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.

This script demonstrates a self-contained function that models the car race collision problem. The function has a input parameter 'n', which represents the number of cars on the road. The function then simulates the collision of cars and returns the number of collisions.
