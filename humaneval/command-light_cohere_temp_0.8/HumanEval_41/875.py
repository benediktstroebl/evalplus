Here's a self-contained Python script that defines a function that solves the car race collision problem:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. All cars move in the same speed. 
    Two cars arey to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return a: number of collisions
    return_list: list of collision pairs (car1, car2)
    """
    return [("front", "back")] + sum(
        [("back", "front") for _ in range(n)]
    )[::-1]

# Testing the function
n = int(input("Enter the number of cars: "))
result = car_race_collision(n)
print(result)
```
This code defines a function that simulates a car race collision scenario with n cars. It uses a specific to this problem, which is to find collision pairs between adjacent cars on an infinitely long road. 

The function returns a list of collision pairs, where the first element in each pair is the front car and the second element is the back car. This function can be easily tested by calling it with a number of cars and printing the resulting collision pairs.
