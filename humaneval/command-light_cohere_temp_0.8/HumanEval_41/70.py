```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. All cars move in the same speed.
    Two cars are collision. Each car's maximum of  two moves before it stops.
    The function outputs the number of the collisions.
```
This Python code defines a function called **car_race_collision** which simulates a basic road-racing collision event. The function takes an integer **n** as input, representing the number of cars involved in the race. The function uses a concept of a race collision, where two sets of cars are driving in opposite directions along a straight line. 

The collision is simulated by having each car move a maximum of 2 consecutive moves before coming to a complete stop. The output of the function is the number of collisions that occurred in the race, which could be 0 or more based on the input **n** value.
