```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    Two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other. All cars move in the same speed.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    Returns: number of collisions.

function takes an integer n as input and returns the number of collisions between n cars. 
```
This code defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates a collision between a set of n cars on a straight road. The function takes an parameter n, which represents the number of cars, and returns the number of collisions between the cars. The code uses a concept of "infinity" to ensure that the cars will collide with each other infinitely many times, and the number of collisions will be equal to the product of n and 2.

This function is self-contained and does not require any external variables or functions to be called.
