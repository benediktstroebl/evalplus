```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. 
    Two cars meet collision. 
    - One car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    - The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory.
    - This result, all cars keep moving and collide in the same place.
    The function outputs the number of the collisions.
```
This Python function, `car_race_collision`, simulates the collision of cars on a straight road. It takes an parameter `n` as input, which represents the number of cars on the road. The function creates a scenario where `n` cars are driving towards each other on a straight road. 

Each car is moving at a constant speed and is infinitely strong, so it will continue moving in the same direction after the collision. 

The function then checks if a car moving towards the right hits a car moving to the left. If a collision occurs, the cars will continue moving in their original direction, but they will collide at the same place on the road. 

Finally, the function returns the number of collisions that occurred.
