Here's the Python code that solves the car race collision problem you provided:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.
    Two cars are the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    return: number of collisions, list of collisions
    """
    collisions = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if i == j or i == j - n or j == i - n:
                collisions[i].append(j)
    return collisions
```

This code defines a function called `car_race_collision` that takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of cars on the race track. It then creates a list `collisions` that contains `n` empty lists, which are used to store the results of each collision between the cars on the track.

Each round of collisions is simulated by iterating over the range of `n` cars, and for each pair of cars, if they are either adjacent or form a straight angle, they are considered to have collided.  The list of `i` is appended to the corresponding `j` in `collisions[i]`. Finally, the function returns the list `collisions`, which contains the results of each collision.
