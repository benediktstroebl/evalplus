This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates an arrangement of `n` cars on a straight road, with some cars driving towards the right and others driving towards the left. It determines the time of the first collision, and the output is the elapsed time of each collision in seconds.

This function is then tested with a variety of input values and the results are printed. The output should show the expected time of the first collision.

This code is self-contained, and it does not require any external libraries or modules. It can be easily run and tested directly within the Python interpreter.
