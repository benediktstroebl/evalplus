```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars have the to collide, so let's simulate this by simulating each car moving. 
    Each car is move and collide in a cycle of two consecutive points. The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
And here is the test code:
```python
# Input number of cars
n = int(input("Enter number of cars: "))

# Function call
car_race_collision(n)

# Test: valid inputs should result in a number of collisions greater than 0
```
