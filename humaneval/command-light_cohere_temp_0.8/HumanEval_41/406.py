# Call the function with argument 3 to test
# the output against the expected result
test_car_race_collision()

This code defines a function that simulates an elastic collision on a straight road, with two cars moving in opposite directions. The function returns the `None` if all absolute differences between subsequent positions in the collision sequence are less than 1.  The test_car_race_collision function is a simple way to verify the function's correctness.
