    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars, which are moving towards each other on the road
    collide and then continue moving in their respective directions as if they did not collide.

    return: collision = []

This Python code defines a function called `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision scenario. The function takes an input of the number of cars involved in the race and then uses a loop to create a list of all the cars' positions at the start of the race. It initializes this collisions as pairs of cars that are not the same, and then updates the positions of the cars so that they overlap. The function returns the number of collisions by returning the length of the `collision` list.
