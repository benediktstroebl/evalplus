This Python script defines a function called car_race_collision, which simulates a head-to-head collision between two cars on a straight road. The function takes an integer n as input, which represents the number of cars on the road. The cars are assumed to be moving in opposite directions, with each set of n cars driving in the same direction. The function calculates the number of collisions and returns it as an integer. It is then used to test the output of the function by creating a list of 0 values and passing it as the argument n. The function then calculates the number of collisions and stores it in the list. Finally, it prints the number of collisions.
