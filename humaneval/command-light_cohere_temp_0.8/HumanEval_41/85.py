Here's a self-contained Python function that simulates a car race collision scenario, in which two cars move toward opposite directions on a straight road, and their movement continues uninterrupted despite the presence of collisions:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. 

    Two cars will the

    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. 
    The function outputs the number of collisions.

def count_collisions(n):
    collisions = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if i == j:
                # One car is moving left, the other is moving right
                continue_driving(i, j)
                collisions += 1
    return collisions

def continue_driving(i, j):
    """Continue driving cars i and j based on their relative position."""
    if i < j:
        # Car i is moving left, so it should continue moving right
        speed = i // 2
        time = 1 / speed
        car_i = i % 2
        car_j = j % 2
        return (speed, time, car_i, car_j)
    else:
        # Car j is moving left, so it should continue moving left
        speed = j // 2
        time = 1 / speed
        car_j = j % 2
        car_i = i % 2
        return (speed, time, car_j, car_i)
```
The `car_race_collision` function simulates the scenario of two cars moving towards opposite directions on a straight road. It uses nested loops to track the movement of the two cars, and the `continue_driving` function determines the direction and speed of each car based on its relative position to the other.

This code can be used as a standalone solution to the problem of counting car collisions in a race scenario. It can be easily adapted for different scenarios and requirements.
