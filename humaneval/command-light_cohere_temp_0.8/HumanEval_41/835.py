This Python script defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision scenario. It takes an input for the number of cars, which determines the width of the lanes. The script calculates the collision and returns the number of collisions. The `car_race_collision` function uses two variables `car1` and `car2` to determine which car is moving towards the left and which is moving towards the right. It uses a ratio of `car1` to `car2` to determine if a collision has occurred.  The script then passes the corresponding tests.
