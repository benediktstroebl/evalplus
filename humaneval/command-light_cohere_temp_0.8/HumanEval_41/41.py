```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. 

    The function outputs whether the cars collide, and if not, the number of cars that will collide
    with the other car moving right to left.

    return:
        i = 0
        j = n
        while i < n and j >= 0:
            if abs(i - j) <= 1:
                print(f'Collisions at position {i} and {j}!
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            print(f'{i} and {j} do not collide.')
    return 0
