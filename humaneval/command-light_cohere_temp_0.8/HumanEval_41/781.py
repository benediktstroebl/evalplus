```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed.
    Two cars intended to collide on the road, the one that starts moving right first hits the other car that starts moving left. 
    They function outputs the area of the collision.
```
Let me know if I can provide any further assistance!
