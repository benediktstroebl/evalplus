# Driver code to test the function
test_car_race_collision()

This code defines a function called `car_race_collision` that simulates a head-on collision between two cars on a straight road. It takes an input of the number of cars, which are represented as an array. The cars start out being very far from each other and move towards each other at the same speed. 

The function then calculates the time it takes for the cars to collide (if they collide) and determines if a collision has occurred based on the relative positions and speeds of the cars. The function then prints a number of collisions and whether a collision was detected or not. 

This code could be further extended and modified to simulate more complex scenarios, such as collisions between multiple cars or cars with different speeds, or to handle other types of collision detection.
