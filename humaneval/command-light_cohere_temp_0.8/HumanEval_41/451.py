```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars have the dry friction, so they will not stop instantly.

    The function outputs the count of the collisions.
```

This code defines a function car_race_collision that simulates a car race collision scenario. It takes the realistic representation of cars moving towards each other on a straight line and colliding without stopping immediately. The function simulates the number of collisions between the cars.
