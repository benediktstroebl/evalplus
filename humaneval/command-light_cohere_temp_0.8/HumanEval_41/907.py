```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    They two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed.
    Two cars will hit, move with a certain speed and thus are infinitely sturdy and strong, 
    and they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. This function outputs the
 number of collisions.

if __name__ == 'car_race_collision':
    return {"number_collisions": car_race_collision(10)}
