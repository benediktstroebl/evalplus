```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. Each car moves in uniform speed and with the same acceleration, and they have infinite durability. When two cars that are moving towards each other collide, they 'reset' their motion so that they continue moving along their respective trajectories (as if they had not hit each other).

    The function determines if the number of cars is even and returns the number of collisions.
```
This function takes an integer n and returns the number of collisions that would happen when n sets of cars are moving towards each other.
