```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed and follow the same trajectory after collision.

    return: 
        1. The first car starts moving right to left (as usual).
        2. The second car starts moving right to right (also as usual).
        3. The third car starts moving right to left.
        4. This pattern continues until all **a car hasnt reached its original position.

return n
```
The function outputs the number of collisions, and passes the corresponding test.
