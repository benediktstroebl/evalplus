    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. 
    The two cars are moving towards each other and are heading to collide.
    When a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, the cars will continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
