```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    As two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars will moving to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    Returns the number of collisions.
```
The provided code defines a function called `car_race_collision` that simulates the collision of cars on a straight road. The function takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of cars on the road. The function then creates two sets of `n` cars, driving in opposite directions. The cars are placed far from each other, and the function simulates the collision of the cars by checking if a car moving to the right hits a car moving to the left. The cars are then able to collide, and the function outputs the number of collisions that occurred.

The code is a good example of a self-contained function that can be used to solve a problem and pass corresponding tests.
