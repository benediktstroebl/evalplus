    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    All cars have in same speed and direction. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, 
    as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    
    Two cars are intended to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. 
   
    function outputs the a number of collisions.

This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates the race collision of cars on a straight road. It sets up a and prints the number of collisions. It also tests the integrity of passing a test.
