Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the car race collision problem:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. Each car moves in the same speed. 
    There two cars are collision
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left,
    they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The number of collisions is returned.
    """
```
This script defines a function called `car_race_collision` that solves the car race collision problem. It takes the number of collisions that occur in the race, which is a result of the cars' movement and the function returns True if there are any collisions, and False otherwise.
