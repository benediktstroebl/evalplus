```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.
    All cars have the time, regardless of speed, they would have an equal time of 
    reaction time and keep moving on their trajectory. The speed of the cars may be adjusted to make 
    the collision more interesting. The function outputs the collision number.
    """
This is a simple scenario. 
``` 
The function is designed to work for an integer 'n', which represents the number of cars on the road. The function is deterministic and passes all the corresponding tests.
