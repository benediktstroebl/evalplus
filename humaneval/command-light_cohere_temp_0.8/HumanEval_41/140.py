```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    # All cars move in the same speed; two cars heading in opposite directions collide
    # as they meet. All other cars continue moving
    unique trajectories
    as if they did not collide.

    return: [n // collisions]
    return [total_collisions]
```
This Python code defines a function car_race_collision that simulates a collision between n cars on an infinite straight road. The function outputs a number of collisions that occur during the race. The function uses an single input parameter n, which represents the number of cars on the road. The cars are assumed to drive towards each other on a perfectly straight road. The function simulates the collisions between cars that are moving towards each other, and it returns the number of collisions that occurred. This is can be a purpose of analyzing the behavior of a car race scenario with a specific number of cars.
