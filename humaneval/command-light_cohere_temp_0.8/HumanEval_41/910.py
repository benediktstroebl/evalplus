```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    All cars move in the same speed; two cars will collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.

    If cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return:
    all collisions are considered a False result, so the function returns the number of collisions.

# Example tests
for x in range(1000000):
    if car_race_collision(x) == 0:
        print(f"No collisions occurred at {x} vehicles")
    else:
        print(f"Collisions occurred at {x} vehicles")
```

The function 'car_race_collision' calculates the number of collisions that occur when two sets of vehicles of 'n' vehicles each are driving towards each other on an infinitely long straight road. The function returns the fact, that is, the cars collide with each other and continue moving in their direction. The test ensures that no collisions occur when 'x' vehicles are moving, which is a logical condition.
