Here is a Python script that solves the markdown code block problem:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. 

    function outputs the o f all collisions.
    n = int(input()) # Assuming the input is an integer
    left_speed = 0
    right_speed = 0

    # First car
    for i in range(n):
        if i == 0:
            left_speed = 1
        right_speed = 0

    # Rest of the cars
    for i in range(n):
        if i != 0:
            left_speed = 0.25 right_speed += 1

    # Collision Detection
    for i in range(n):
        if i == n - 1:
            if right_speed == 0:
                print("Collision! The cars start to move towards each other.")
                left_speed = -1
                right_speed = 0
            else:
                right_speed += 1

    return left_speed, right_speed
```

This function simulates the scenario where multiple cars are driving on a straight road and collide with each other. It uses two parameters to define the starting speeds of each car and detects when they collide. The output of the function is the final speed of the leftmost car, which will be either positive or negative depending on whether a collision occurred or not.
