This function takes an integer n as input, representing the number of cars on the road. It uses two nested loops to simulate the movement of the cars and to determine if they collide. 

The output of the function is a list of numbers, where each number represents the number of collisions between a pair of cars. 

This self-contained Python script solves the problem of counting the number of collisions between pairs of cars on a straight road and passes the corresponding test.
