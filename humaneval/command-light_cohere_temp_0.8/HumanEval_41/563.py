This Python script defines a function called `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision scenario. The function takes an input `n`, which represents the number of cars on the road, and uses this input to create a list of tuples representing the cars, where each tuple contains the index (`i`) of the car and the index (`j`) of its corresponding passenger. 

The script then simulates the collision of cars on the road, where cars are driving in opposite directions. The `car_collisions` function is used to keep track of which cars are currently colliding and to generate a set of tuples representing the colliding cars and their indices. The `main` driver code takes user input for the number of cars and uses that input to create a list of tuples representing the cars. It then calls thees the the `car_race_collision` function to simulate the car race collision, and the output is stored in the `car_collisions` set.
