```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    These two cars are in the same speed and are infinitely sturdy, so they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    Returns True if there are any collision.

    n = int(input("Enter the number of cars: "))
    collisions = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i == j: continue
            continue
            else:
                # Two cars are driving towards each other
                collisions += 1
    return collisions
``` 
The provided Python script defines a function car_race_collision that simulates a collision between two sets of cars on a straight road. The function takes an integer input n, which represents the number of cars on the road. 

The script then creates a loop that allows two cars to collide, and increments the collisions count if the condition is met.
