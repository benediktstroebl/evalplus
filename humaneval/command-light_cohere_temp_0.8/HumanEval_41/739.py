```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed; two cars move in and collide and stop.
    The function outputs the number of the collisions.

    return [True] * 3

# Driver code
n = int(input("Enter the number of cars: "))
cars = []
for i in range(n):
