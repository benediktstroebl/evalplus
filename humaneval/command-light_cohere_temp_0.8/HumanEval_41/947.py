    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.
    As the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    All cars in the road will move without interruption. A collision is not detected and the movement continues.
    return:
    A list of collisions is returned. The list should have each car that collides with the next car.
