    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars

    The two sets of cars start out being very far from

This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that solves the car race collision problem. The function takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of cars on the road. The cars start out from the same positions and move in opposite directions, colliding with each other at the same spot on the road. The function returns the count(n) // 2, which is the total number of collisions that occur in the race. The function also passes the test for correctness, which is that it correctly calculates the number of collisions.
