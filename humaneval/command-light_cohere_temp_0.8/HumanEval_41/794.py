The provided Python script defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates the dynamic movement of cars on a straight road. This function takes an input parameter n, which represents the number of cars involved in the race. It uses the particular scenario where two sets of n cars are driving in opposite directions along a straight road. The cars are assumed to collide with each other, but due to their infinite strength, they continue moving in their respective directions as if no collision had occurred. The function outputs 0, indicating that no collision took place in this particular scenario.
