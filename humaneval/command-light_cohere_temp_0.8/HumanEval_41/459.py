```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed; two cars will collide and continue moving in their original direction.

    return: The number of collisions between all pairs of cars.
```

# Example usage
n = int(input("Enter the number of cars: "))
collisions = car_race_collision(n)
print(collisions)

```
The code defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates a car race collision. It takes an input from the number of cars (n) and returns the number of collisions between all pairs of cars. The function works by assuming that the cars are driving in opposite directions and are infinitely strong, so they will continue moving in their original direction even after colliding. The function returns the number of collisions, which is the number of ways in which the cars are interacting with each other.
