    This function will test the car_race_collision function with n=6.

This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates the movement of cars on a straight road. It then provides a test_car_race_collision function that tests the `car_race_collision` function with different input sizes and asserts that the number of collisions matches the expected output.
