```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and maintain the same speed during the collision.

    Two cars moving towards each to collide. 

    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, the collision will occur. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they will continue moving in their respective trajectories as if they did not collide.

    The function returns True if there are no collisions, or a list of collision pairs if there are collisions.

test_collision = [2,3,4]
# Call the function with the test
result = car_race_collision(test_collision)

# Print the result
print(result)
