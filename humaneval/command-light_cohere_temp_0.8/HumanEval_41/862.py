This code defines a function `car_race_collision` that calculates the number of collisions between two sets of cars on a straight road. The function returns the expected number of collisions. 

The `main` example usage section prompts the user to input the value for `n` (the number of cars on the road), and then calls the `car_race_collision` function with the user input.
