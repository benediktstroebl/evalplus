```
This code defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates a car race collision problem, where two sets of cars are driving in opposite directions along a straight road. The cars are modeled as infinitely strong and the function assumes that when a car moving to the right hits a car moving left, they will continue moving along their original trajectory. The function returns the number of collisions that occur in the race, which is the number of cars that are involved in the collision. 
The test_car_race_collision function is a stand-alone Python script that includes the car_race_collision function and passes the corresponding test, which verifies that the function works correctly when called with the argument 3.
