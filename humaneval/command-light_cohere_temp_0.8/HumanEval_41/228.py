Here's the solution:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars have the spots in their own starting positions,
    and each car moves at the same speed in the same direction.
    Two cars want to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    This function outputs whether there were any collisions or not based on the collision conditions.
    """
    return sum(1 for i in range(n)) - sum(1 for i in range(n) if car_status[i][1] == 'right')
```
This function simulates the cars on the road, starting at different positions and moving at the same speed. It then calculates the the collision status based on the movement and direction of each car. If two cars have the provided conditions for collision, the function will return a true value.
