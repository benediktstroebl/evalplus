Here's a self-contained Python script that defines a function car_race_collision that solves the problem you provided:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars have the escort collision 
    until they reach their respective endpoints. All cars continue moving theireneously moving in their trajectory.
    The function outputs the collisions.
 - If the number of collisions was
    """

    return sum([2**i -1 for i in range(n+1)])

# Example usage
n = int(input("Enter the number of cars: "))
print(car_race_collision(n))
```
This code defines a function `car_race_collision` that calculates the number of collisions between `n` cars on a road that is a perfectly straight line. The function uses mathematical reasoning to determine when two cars will collide, and the number of collisions is returned.

The `car_race_collision` function also includes a docstring that provides a detailed description of the function and its purpose, which is good practice to make the code self-explanatory.
