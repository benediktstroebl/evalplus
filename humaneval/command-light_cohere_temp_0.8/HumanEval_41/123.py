```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and have the same acceleration. Two cars, moving towards each other, will collide and continue moving in their respective directions.

    Return True if there are at least two cars, and False otherwise.
```
This Python function determines whether two cars will collide in a head-to-head collision on a straight road. It models the scenario of cars moving toward each other and checks if they will collide based on their positions and movement. The function returns True if there are at least two cars and False otherwise.
