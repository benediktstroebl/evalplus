```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and travel indefinitely. 

    function outputs the next_n_collision, a tuple of collision results.

    return:
        The number of collisions.
        collision_list: list of tuples, where each tuple contains the index of the car involved in the collision, the other car's index, and the speed of the collision (positive if the car is moving towards each other, otherwise negative).
    On average, the two cars will continue to move as if they didn't collide, and their speeds will stay the same after the collision.
