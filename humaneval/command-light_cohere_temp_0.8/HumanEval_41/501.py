Here is a Python script that demonstrates a solution to the car race collision problem using an optimization technique:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    All cars move in the same speed and move at the same rate (like in a race).
   
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
    Returns a simple integer n and is tested for its validity.

    ```
def main():
    n = int(input("Enter the number of cars: "))
    if n <= 0:
        print("Please enter a positive integer.")
    else:
        result = car_race_collision(n)
        print(f"Number of collisions: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
The function car_race_collision solves the problem of cars moving towards each other on an infinite road and colliding. It uses an simple approach that all cars move at the same speed, and it takes the number of cars as input. 

The main function takes user input and passes it to the car_race_collision function. The function returns the number of collisions, and the output is printed.
