    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed, and the function outputs the number of collisions.
   
    return 2

# Driver right-to-left car
right = [0, 0, 0, 0]

    for j in range(n):
        if left[i] == right[j]:
            print(i, j, "collide")

This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a head-to-head car collision on a straight road. The two drivers move their different cars, and the function determines if there was a collision by comparing the positions of the two cars. The `car_race_collision` function then updates the positions of the two cars so that they will continue moving along their original trajectories after the collision.
