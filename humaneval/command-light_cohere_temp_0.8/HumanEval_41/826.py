```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars
   a start out being on either side of the road
    at an equal distance from each other. 
    When two cars are moving towards each other at an equal speed. 

    time they collide
    When a car that's moving right to left hits a car that's moving left to right, the two cars will continue moving
    in their respective directions as if they did not collide. The function returns True of the collisions.
```

This script defines a function `car_race_collision` which simulates the mentioned scenario of two sets of cars driving towards each other on a straight road. The `def` is defined with the function parameter `n` representing the number of cars. 
This function follows the logic where two cars start out from rest and move towards each other at the same speed. When they collide, they continue moving in their respective directions as if they did not hit each other.
