```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. 

    All cars move in the same speed; two cars are
    determined to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car
    that's moving right to left. All cars continue moving in their same speed as if they did not collide.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
The function car_race_collision is defined with an integer parameter n, representing the number of cars on the road. The function simulates the movement of the cars on the road and checks for collisions. When a collision is detected, the cars "bounce off" each other and continue moving in their original directions. The function also counts the number of collisions and returns the count.

This code is a good example of a self-contained function that demonstrates a complete behavior with all the required inputs and outputs.
