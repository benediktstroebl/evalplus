```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. All cars move in the same speed.
    Two cars are move in the same direction to collide. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    Returns the number of cars that collide.

test_collision = car_race_collision(5)
 assert test_collision == 2
