```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. 

    function outputs the reasons collisions with the 'n' number of cars. 
    
    return n
 collisions
