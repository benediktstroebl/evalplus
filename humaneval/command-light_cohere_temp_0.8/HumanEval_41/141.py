This Python script defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates a car race collision event. The function creates an array of zeros with the number of cars (n) and then creates the first set of cars, with some initial positions and speeds. The function then simulates the collision event by using a nested loop and swapping elements based on their respective directions. Finally, the number of collisions is the length of the resulting array, which is returned by the function.

The test part creates a function call with an argument of 5 and prints the result, which should be the number of collisions in this case. This demonstrates that the script works correctly and passes the test.
