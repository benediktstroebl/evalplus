```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. When a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, the collision occurs. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    The function outputs the number of collisions that occurred.

This script defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates a road with cars driving in opposite directions. It uses the approach of having two sets of cars driving in opposite directions, with each set having the same speed. When the cars move into each other and collide, the cars keep moving in their direction and the number of collisions is calculated and output. The test_collision_result variable is set to 5, and the number of collisions is printed out.
