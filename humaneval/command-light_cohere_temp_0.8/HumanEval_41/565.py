Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function `car_race_collision(n: int)`:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed
    Two cars are moving towards each other to collide.
    If cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return:  Number of cars that will collide
    collides = n // 2  # Calculate the index of each set of cars that are driving right to left.
    return: True  # Signal that a collision occurred
    return collides
```
This function simulates the scenario of two sets of cars moving towards each other on a straight road. The collision occurs when a car that is moving to the right collides with a car that is moving to the left. 

It calculates the index of each set of cars that are driving right to left and returns True as the signal of a collision. 

This function can be easily tested by running it and verifying that it returns the correct result for different values of `n`.
