```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars have the Meanwhile in the same speed and direction, they will collide. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they will continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    However, if the cars are not identical in speed and direction, they will not collide, and each car will continue its path unhindertently.

    The function outputs a number of collisions.
```

This function takes an integer n as input, which represents the number of cars on the road. It uses the concept of the cars driving in opposite directions to collide, and the cars are infinitely strong, so they continue moving along their paths. The function checks if the number of cars is even and that all cars are driving in the same direction. It then finds the time it takes each car to collide with the other car, and adds up the times to get the total time it takes for both cars to collide. The function then checks if the total time is less than the total length of the road, and if it is, the cars did collide. Otherwise, the cars did not collide, and the function returns 0.
