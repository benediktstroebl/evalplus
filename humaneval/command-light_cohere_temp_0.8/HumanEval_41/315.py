```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed.
    Two cars are collision as they happen to be moving towards each other.
    This function outputs a number of collisions.
```
This code defines a function that simulates a race collision between `n` cars on a straight road. The cars are moving in opposite directions, and the function calculates the number of collisions that occur. 

The function uses a template approach, where it treats the collision event as an occurrence of two cars moving towards each other. The function then counts the number of collisions and returns the total count.
