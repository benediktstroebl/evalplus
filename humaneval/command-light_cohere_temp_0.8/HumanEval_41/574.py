```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```

This Python function appears to simulate car crashes on a straight road. It takes an single integer argument 'n', which represents the number of vehicles on the road.
