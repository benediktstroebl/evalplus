This script defines a function called **car_race_collision** that simulates the number of collisions between two sets of cars on a straight road. The function uses a number of cars and returns the number of collisions. The function uses a recursive backtracking to determine if the current car is equal to the previous one, or if the current car is going left and the previous one is going right, and so on. The function uses the number of cars as the initial conditions and returns the number of collisions as the final output.
