 ``` 
The function car_race_collision simulates the collision between two cars on a road, where one is driving left and the other is driving right, simulating the effect of collision and both cars continue moving in their original direction. 

The function returns the number of collisions, which is the number of cars that collide, as the cars are infinitely strong and move in a straight line.
