```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    Two cars want to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left,
    they will continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
The function takes in an integer n and determines the number of collisions. The function works by simulating the car race scenario and counting the number of cars that collide.
