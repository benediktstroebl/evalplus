```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    As two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars will moving to collide and hit each other when moving left to right.
    and start moving on their respective trajectories.

    The function outputs the collisions and passes the following tests: 
    1. Check if the collisions are within the given time interval. 
    2. Check if the for each basic car
    if the car was already at rest and not moving. 
    3. Check if the other maximum car if is moving. 

Here is the function: 
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """ 
    A function that simulates a head-on car race collision on a straight road. It takes the following approach:
    - The function takes an integer 'n' as input, which represents the number of cars participating in the collision. 
    - It cars start out being positioned at different points along the road. 
    - The cars are moving in opposite directions, with one set driving left to right and the other driving right to left. 
    - When collisions occur when the cars moving right to left hit the cars moving right to left. 
    - The cars are infinitely strong, so they continue moving along their original trajectories. 
    - The function outputs the number of collisions, which represents the number of cars that have collided with each other. 
    """
    test_collisions():
    - The function checks if the number of collisions is within the range of possible collisions. 
    - It time to test_collisions() is started when all cars have moved to the point where they will collide. This function checks each car and checks if the car was already at rest. It also checks if the expected to collide with other cars. 
    - It time to test_collisions() is stopped when all cars have moved out of the collision zone. 

This function can be used to simulate a head-on car race collision on a straight road with a given number of cars.
