Here is a Python script that solves the problem of markdown code blocks, given an input n:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed. Two cars meeting are this either move right to left hit each other at the same location.
    In this scenario, as the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    Returns the number of collisions.
: highest number of right-to-left collisions.
    """
This function is a simulation of a race collision. 
```
This script defines a function called `car_race_collision` that takes in an integer `n` as input and performs a simulation of a car race collision. The function outputs the highest number of right-to-left collisions that occur during the simulation.
