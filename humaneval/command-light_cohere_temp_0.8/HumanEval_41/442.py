```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. All cars move in same same speed. Two cars facing each collision run into each other head-on and then move away, continuing their original trajectory. 
    
    This result: The two cars "bump into" each other and then move away without a collision. They effectively "bounce off" each other, and no collision or stopping is involved.

    Test:
    ```n = int(input())
    if car_race_collision(n) != n:
        raise ValueError("Solution does not correctly determine the number of collisions.")
    ```
