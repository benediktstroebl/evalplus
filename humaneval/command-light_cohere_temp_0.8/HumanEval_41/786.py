```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    All cars move in the same speed and direction; two cars will collide
    and continue moving in their trajectory.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.

def test_collision(n: int):
    return n >= 3 and any( [abs(x - y) for x, y in zip(cars)] >= 0.5)

cars = [i for i in range(n)]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(input("Enter the number of cars: "))
    if test_collision(n):
        print("This is the number of collisions.")
    else:
        print("This is not the number of collisions.")
```

This code defines a function called `car_race_collision` that simulates a head-to-head collision between two cars on a straight road. The `test_collision` function is used to verify if a given number of cars is a valid input for the `car_race_collision` function.
