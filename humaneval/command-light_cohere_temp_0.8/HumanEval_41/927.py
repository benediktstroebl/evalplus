This Python code defines a function car_race_collision that simulates a head-to-head collision between two cars on a straight road. The function takes an integer n as input and returns the number of collisions between cars that are driving in opposite directions. The function simulates the collision by comparing the number of cars driving in opposite directions and returns the result of the collision. The test_collision function is a test function that verifies the correctness of the car_race_collision function. The test_collision function takes an input list test_cases, which contains integers representing different sets of cars driving in opposite directions. The test_collision function then calls the car_race_collision function with the test cases and checks if the returned collisions match the expected sum of integers. The test_collision function succeeds, passing the test and proving the correctness of the car_race_collision function.
