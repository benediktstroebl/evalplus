```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. Each car moves in the same speed
    Two cars moving towards each other will collide and stop moving as if they did not collide before reaching each other. 

    function outputs theas number of collisions.
```
This Python code defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision. The function takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of cars on the road. It uses the same notation to model a set of cars moving towards each other. 

The cars are represented as moving vectors, and the collision detection logic matches the cars that are coming towards each other. The function returns the number of collisions that occur in the race.
