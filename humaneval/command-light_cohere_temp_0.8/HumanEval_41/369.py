```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    These two cars move in the same speed and direction.
    Two cars want to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    When the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    return: returns the count of collisions
```

This Python script defines a function car_race_collision that simulates a car race collision scenario. It takes a imagine a road as a straight line that cars are driving on. 

The cars driving to the right are simultaneously countered by cars driving right. When these cars come into contact, they do not actually "hit" each other but, instead, continue moving along their respective paths as if they had not made contact. This simulates the all effect of strong and durable cars with no loss of motion due to collisions. 

The function outputs the number of collisions, which is the number of cars that were moving in the same direction and collided with each other at some point during the race.
