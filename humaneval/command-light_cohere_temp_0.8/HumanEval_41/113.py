Here's a self-contained Python script that defines a function `car_race_collision` solving the car race collision problem:

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed, and two cars want to collide. The first car to move left to right hits the second car that's driving right to left, and they both continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return:
    -
    The function outputs whether a collision happened or not.
    """
    return collision"""
```

This function accepts an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of cars on the road. The function then uses two sets of cars, one driving left to right and the other driving right to left, to collide with each other. It calculates the collision using the cars' movement, which can be used to determine if they collided or not. The function then returns a collision status, which can be either True if there was a collision or False if there wasn't.

This function is self-contained, which means that it can be called and used to solve the car race collision problem without requiring any external code.
