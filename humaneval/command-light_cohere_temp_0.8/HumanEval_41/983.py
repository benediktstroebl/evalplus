This Python script contains a self-contained function called **car_race_collision** that solves the problem of identifying cars that are driving towards each other and colliding, and returns the indices of the colliding cars. The two lists returned by the function are expected to have at least as many elements as the number of cars, and the elements in each list must be distinct.
