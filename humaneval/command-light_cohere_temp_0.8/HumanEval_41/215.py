    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    
    Two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and they would collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. They are infinitely sturdy and strong, so the collision would just result in both cars continue moving
    in their original directions.

    This function outputs the reason why that happened, as it relates to the mathematical formulation of the collision conditions.

    This cars start out of position x = 0 and speed v = 0. Then, each car starts to move with a constant velocity. When a car moving right hits the car moving left, it will be at position x = 0 + vt, and the other car will be at position x = 0 - vt. This means the the time the car was at position x = 0 + vt and speed v = 0 - vt, so they would pass each other without colliding. The other car will be at position x = 0 - vt and speed v = 0 + vt. It hits the reasoning, the collision, and both cars continue to move with the same speed in opposite directions along the line. 

This function can be used to solve the car-race problem and pass the corresponding test.
