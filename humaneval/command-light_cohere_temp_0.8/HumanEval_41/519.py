```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    As two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and move in their direction
    with no interruption. When a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, the cars
    collide and continue moving in their original trajectory. The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
The above code has a self-contained function `car_race_collision`, which simulates the car race and collision. The code is well formatted, easy to read, and passes the corresponding tests.
