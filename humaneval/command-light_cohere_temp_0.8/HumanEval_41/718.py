Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of cars racing and colliding:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.
    All cars have the By the speed at which they approach each other. 
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
This function simulates a collision between two cars moving on a straight road. It uses a number of cars, the speed of each car, and the direction each car is moving in to determine whether a collision has occurred and the number of cars involved. 

The function works by simulating the motion of each car and then checking to see if any of the cars have collided.
