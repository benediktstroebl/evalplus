```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. All cars move in same same speed. Two cars meet collision when a cars that are moving left to right hit a car that's moving right to left.
    In this case, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The function outputs number of collisions.
```

This code defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates a car race collision scenario. It takes the number of cars driving in opposite directions and their common speed, then simulates a collision between two cars that are moving in opposite directions. The cars are considered to be infinitely strong, so they will continue moving in their original direction after the collision. The function then returns the number of cars that were involved in the collision.
