def car_race_collision(n: int):

    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    All cars move in the same speed, two cars are designed to collide.
    When a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, 
    it pushes it back into its original direction.
    This cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.

test_collision()

The test_collision() function prompts the user to input the number of cars, and then it enters a loop where it asks the user for the direction of each car and counts the number of cars that are moving in that direction. If a car is moving in the right direction, and a collision occurs, the function pushes it back. The function continues until no collision occurs.
