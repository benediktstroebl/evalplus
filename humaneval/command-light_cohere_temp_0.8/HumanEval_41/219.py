```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    As two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed.
    The function outputs the collisions.
    """
    function calculates and returns the number of collisions.
```
This Python script defines a function called `car_race_collision` that solves the problem of counting the number of cars colliding on a straight road with `n` cars driving towards the left at the same speed.
