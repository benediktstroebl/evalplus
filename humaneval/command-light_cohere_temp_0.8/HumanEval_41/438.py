This Python script defines a function car_race_collision that simulates a car race collision scenario. The function takes an integer n as input, representing the number of cars on the road. 

The function uses mathematical logic to ensure that the cars do not collide, and it returns a list of non-negative integers representing the number of cars that will collide with each other. 

The test assert statement checks if the function's output matches the expected output, and if the test passes, it means that the function is working correctly.
