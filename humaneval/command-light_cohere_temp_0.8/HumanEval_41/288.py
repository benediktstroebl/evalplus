```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    This two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed
    The first car moves 2 speed units right, and the second car moves 3 speed units right, and so on. When two cars collide, they both continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. The function outputs the number of collisions.
```

This code defines a function that models a race collision situation, where two sets of cars are driving in opposite directions along a straight road. The speed of each car is set to a constant and the same for both cars. The cars will eventually collide with each other when they reach each other's positions. The collision is modeled in a way that both cars keep their motion after the collision, and the function returns the number of collisions that occurred.
