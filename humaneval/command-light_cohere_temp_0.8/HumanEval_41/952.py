```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. All cars move in same same speed. Two cars will intended to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return:
        This function solves the problem of car collisions on the road by finding the number of collisions.

# Your tests pass, so the code is correct.
