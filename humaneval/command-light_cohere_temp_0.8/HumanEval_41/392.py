    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and move at the same speed. Two cars moving head-right-to-left collide and change their direction. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. This function outputs the multiple collisions (an integer list)

This Python script defines a function car_race_collision that simulates a car race collision scenario. It starts by creating an list of cars, initially with some cars driving left and others driving right. Then, it iterates through this list to find pairs of cars that collide head-on and change their relative directions accordingly. After the collision detection, it returns a list of collision pairs. The driver code then reads the input and calls the car_race_collision function, and then it iterates through the returned collision list to print each collision pair.
