```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and move as a function of their initial position.
    Two cars intended to collide meet each other's moving speed and position at the same time and then they collide. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
The code passes all the test cases correctly.
