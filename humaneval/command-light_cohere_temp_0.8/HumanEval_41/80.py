The above Python code defines a function named `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision scenario. It operates with two sets of cars, `c1` and `c2`, each moving in opposite directions along a long road. The cars collide and then move apart in their respective directions. The function calculates the number of cars that were involved in the collision. It achieves this by colliding two sets of cars and returns the sum of their corresponding vehicle lengths.
