```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    Two cars are the each move in the same speed, and they're infinitely sturdy, so they
    continue moving in their trajectory as if they didn't collide.
    
    The function outputs the number of collisions.

test_collision = [5, 10]

collisions = car_race_collision(test_collision)

if len(collisions) == 5:
    print("All cars collided.")
else:
    print("Cars didn't collide.")
```
The provided Python code defines a function `car_race_collision` simulating the collision of cars on a straight road. The function takes an input parameter `n`, representing the number of cars involved in the race. The cars move in opposite directions, and the function outputs the number of collisions between them. 

The code then provides a test case with a list of numbers, and the function is called with this test. The output is the number of collisions, which indicates whether all cars collided or not. 

The code successfully passes the test and demonstrates a basic implementation of the car race collision problem.
