Here is a Python script that defines a self-contained function that solves the problem of finding the number of collisions between two sets of cars on a straight road:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driver left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. Two cars will collide if they a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. All cars are the story as if they didn't collide.

    If function outputs the plain object with a count of collisions.
```
The function starts by simulating two sets of cars moving towards each other on a straight road. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so when they collide they just continue moving along their original paths. 

The function then counts the number of collisions and returns a plain object with that collision count.
