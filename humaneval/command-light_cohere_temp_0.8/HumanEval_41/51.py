This function, car_race_collision, takes an integer n as input and returns an integer value. The function is a following:
It uses the docstring documentation to describe the function's purpose, inputs, and output. The function first determines the n as the input. It then returns an number of collisions, which is the number of cars that collide.

The function works by imagining a road that is a perfectly straight infinitely long line. The function then simulates the cars driving on the road. The cars are driving in opposite directions, with each car moving towards the opposite direction. The cars start out being very far from each other, and the cars move towards each other until they collide. The function assumes that the cars are infinitely strong and have no friction, so they continue moving in their respective trajectories after the collision. 

The function then counts the number of collisions, which is the number of cars that have collided with each other. 

The function is a self-contained, it can be used to solve the car race collision problem and pass corresponding tests.
