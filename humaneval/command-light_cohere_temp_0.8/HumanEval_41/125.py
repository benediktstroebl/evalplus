```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    These function outputs whether collision happened or not.
    """
    cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide. The function returns true if there was a collision; otherwise, it returns false.

# Driver cars start out
for car in range(n):
    x = [1,0] + 1j * 10  # put the cars one after the other moving right.
    yield [x moving right (x)

# Moving right to left
for car in range(n):
    x = [1,0] - 1j * 10  # put the cars one after the other moving left.
    yield x


# Collision detection
for left_car in cars:
    for right_car in cars:
        if left_car == right_car:
            return True

# Returns false if there is no collision
return False
```
This code defines a function that simulates a car race collision scenario. It creates a numbers of cars driving left and right simultaneously and yields their positions at any given time. Then, it detects the collisions by comparing the positions of each car with all the others and returns True if a collision occurred. The function outputs whether collision happened or not.
