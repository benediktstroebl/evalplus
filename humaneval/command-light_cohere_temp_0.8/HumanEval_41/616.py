```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    As the two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed.
    The two cars move to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    Then cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
# The code you provided was for the car_race_collision function

Now, below is a complete Python script that implements the solution for the problem of cars racing against each other and passing a test.
