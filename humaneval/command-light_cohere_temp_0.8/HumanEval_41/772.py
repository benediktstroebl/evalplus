    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    As two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed.
    Two cars will one to collide.
    When the function outputs whether car (a moving left to right) hits a car (moving right to left), or not.

    simple test:
    If two cars meet during the race, both cars should continue moving without a collision.
