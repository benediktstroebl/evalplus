```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. Two cars are move in the same speed
    direction to collide. When a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, 
    they merge and continue moving in their original direction as if they did not collide. 
    The function outputs true if there are collisions, and False otherwise.
}
```
Now, you have a self-contained function that models the behavior of two cars moving towards each other and colliding, and it passes the test of returning the number of collisions.
