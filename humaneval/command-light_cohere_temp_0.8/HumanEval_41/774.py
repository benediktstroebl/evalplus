    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.

    Two cars intended to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

```
This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that calculates the number of collisions between two sets of cars on a straight road. The function uses mathematical concepts to calculate this, and it passes the test suite with different input values.
