```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    As two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars that are moving towards each other will collide and move on their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return:
    If any 2 cars at different positions were to collide, then return True; otherwise, return False.
    """return any collisions"
```

This code defines a function car_race_collision that simulates the described car race scenario. The function takes an integer n as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether any two cars at different positions will collide. The function works by checking if any two cars at different positions will collide, then returns True; otherwise, it returns False. 

This problem is a classic example of an Dynamic Programming problem that can be efficiently solved using the Memoine Technique.
