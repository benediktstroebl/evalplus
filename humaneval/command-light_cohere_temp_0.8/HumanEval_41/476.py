```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars intended to collide will eventually.
    The function outputs the number of the collisions.
```
This Python code defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates a basic scenario of cars racing each other on a straight road. It's essentially an collision detection and counting algorithm for a set of cars moving on the road. The function takes an parameter n, which represents the number of cars in the race, and returns the number of collisions that occur during the race. The code uses a imaginary setup of a straight road and multiple cars moving towards each other. It effectively simulates the count of the collisions between the cars.
