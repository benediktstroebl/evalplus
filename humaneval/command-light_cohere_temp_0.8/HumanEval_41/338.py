    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed, and two cars will collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

       collides_count = [0] * n  # Initialize collision count for each car
    car_id = [0] * n  # Initialize car ID for each car
    car_speed = [0] * n  # Initialize car speed for each car
    collides = [False] * n  # Initialize collision status for each car
    collides[car_id[i]] = True  # Set collision status to True for each car
    # Check for collisions

```
This code defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision scenario. It creates a specific number `n` of cars, where each car has a unique ID, speed, and collision status. The cars drive towards each other, and collisions are simulated based on their positions and speeds. The function sets collision status to `True` for each car and checks for collisions between pairs of cars. It records the collision car IDs and returns the overall collision status for each car.
