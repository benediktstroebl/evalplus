    As two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed.
    The cars will in the same speed, and two cars are driving towards each other. These cars hit and thus collide. After this collision, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their original directions.

This function is well-tested, and its output is used to verify its correctness.

This function simulates a car race scenario with two opposing streams of cars on a straight road. It checks if every car in each stream hits the other stream's cars or not, and whether the collision was perfect or not, by calculating the number of collisions.
