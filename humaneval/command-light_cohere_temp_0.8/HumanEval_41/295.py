This code defines a function car_race_collision that simulates a race collision between n cars on a straight road. The function uses the scenario where two cars move towards each other and "sideswipe" instead of colliding, allowing them to continue moving along their respective directions. The function then counts the collisions and returns the number of collisions. The test_car_race_collision function asks the user for the number of cars and then passes the test.
