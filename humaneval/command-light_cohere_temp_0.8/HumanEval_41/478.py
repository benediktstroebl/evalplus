    collide. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong. When two cars that are moving toward each other collide. The function determines the collision or number of cars that collide and the speed of each car.

This script defines a function car_race_collision that simulates a car race collision problem. It uses the strategy of checking if any two cars are moving toward each other, and if so, checking if their speeds are such that a collision will happen. The function returns the number of collisions.
