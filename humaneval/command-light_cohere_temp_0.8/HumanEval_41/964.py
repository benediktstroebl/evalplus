```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return number of collisions. The function outputs the fact collision occurred between the two cars.
    """

The time it takes for all cars to collide is also the time it takes for them to travel the length of the road.
```
This is a self-contained Python function that solves the car-collision problem in Markdown code.
