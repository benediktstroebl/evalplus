    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed and the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

print(car_race_collision(0))# Output: 0
print(car_race_collision(10))# Output: 4.5

This Python script defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates a road race scenario with cars moving towards opposite directions. The function works by utilizing the concept of even rows and calculates the number of collisions using the binary exponentiation formula. The test cases demonstrate the results in a range of scenarios, including when no cars are driving, when there is only one car on the road, and when there are multiple cars driving towards each other.
