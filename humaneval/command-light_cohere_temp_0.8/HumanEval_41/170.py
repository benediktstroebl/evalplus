    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. Each car is moving in its respective direction is able to collide with any other car
    in the same direction. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong.

This function will simulate the car race collision problem, counting the number of collisions between the cars on the road. The function will create a list of collisions for each car in the colliding group, where each element will be the number of collisions for that specific car.
