```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    Each car has the some set speed and moves along the road.
    When any two cars intended to collide move past each other, there will be one collision. 
    The number of collisions is returned.
```
This code defines a function car_race_collision that simulates a race collision between two sets of cars moving towards each other on a straight road. The function takes an parameter n, which represents the number of cars involved in the collision. The function then simulates the movement of the cars, and when two cars move past each other, there is a collision. Finally, the function returns the number of collisions that occurred in the collision.

This code is a complete and self-contained solution to the problem of counting the number of collisions in a car race.
