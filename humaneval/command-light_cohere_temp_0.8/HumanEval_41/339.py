Here's a self-contained Python function that simulates the car race collision scenario described:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    All cars will in the same speed and direction. Two cars are collide and continue moving in their trajectory.

    Here's a output is the number of collisions.
```
This function simulates a race collision of 'n' cars on a straight road. The cars move towards each other at a constant speed. When two cars collide, they continue moving in the same direction, without any impact on their speed or direction.
