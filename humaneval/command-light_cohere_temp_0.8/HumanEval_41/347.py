    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. All cars move in the same speed and the vehicles are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

```

The provided Python function car_race_collision simulates a car race collision scenario. It takes a number of cars n driving on a straight line, and another set of n cars driving in the opposite direction. The function uses the permutations of the range(n) list, and checks if the second car in the permutation is moving in the opposite direction to collide with the first car. The function returns the number of collisions that occurred during the race.
