```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    They all drive in their same speed. Two cars will move in collision. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. 

    function returns the simple pass of a test - True if the test passed, otherwise False.
