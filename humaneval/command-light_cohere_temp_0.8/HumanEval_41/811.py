```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    As two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed.
    The two cars intended to collide meet each other when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    return number of collisions.
```

This Python function, car_race_collision, simulates a car race collision. It takes a certain of a road as a long, straight line. The function is designed to output the number of collisions that occur during the race. The function simulates a cars driving towards each other, and when a car moving left hits a car moving right, a collision is registered. The cars are assumed to be infinitely strong and durable, so they will continue moving along their original trajectory. 

This self-contained function can be easily used in other scripts or for testing.
