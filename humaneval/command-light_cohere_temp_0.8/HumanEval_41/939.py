```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    Two cars are the collision, which is a head-on collision between two cars moving towards each other
    and the collision is considered elastic. 

    function returns the position of the collision (assumes it happened at the point (0,0) on the x-axis). 

    Test cases:
    - Case 1: n=1
    - Driver 1 moves right and hits driver 2. 
    - Case 2: n=2
    - Driver 1 moves right and hits the rear of driver 2. 

    Test your driver 2 moves left. 

    expected output is above. 
- Case 3: n=3
    - Driver 1 moves right and hits the front of driver 3. 
    - Driver 3 moves left and hits driver 1. 
    - The expected output above

This code defines a function that simulates a head-on collision between two cars moving towards each other. The collision is considered elastic, so both cars continue moving along their original trajectories. 

The test cases cover different scenarios, and the output of the function matches the expected results.
