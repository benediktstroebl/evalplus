This Python script defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision scenario on a straight line. It defines a `move_cars` method that sets the initial positions of `n` cars on the road as driving in the opposite direction. The `detect_collision` method simulates a collision between two cars, and updates the state of the cars if a collision is found. The `Driver` class is a class that represents a driver in the race. It contains a method `__init` that sets the initial positions of the cars as driving in opposite directions, and the `detect_collision` method that searches for a collision between two cars and updates the state accordingly. The `Driver` class is then created with the given number of cars, and the `detect_collision` method is called to simulate the race collision.
