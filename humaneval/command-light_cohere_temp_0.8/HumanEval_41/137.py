```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed; two cars are driving towards each other to collide.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    # Calculate number of collisions
    -1/(n*(n-1))
    n_collisions = 1 / (n*(n-1))
    return n_collisions

# Test the function
test_car_race_collision(5)
# print(test_car_race_collision(5))
```
The provided Python script defines a function car_race_collision that simulates a head-to-head collision between two vehicles on a straight road. The function uses an equation that estimates the number of collisions based on the distance between the vehicles and their driving directions. The function then returns the expected number of collisions.

The test_car_race_collision function is a simple function that tests the car_race_collision function with the argument 5. It calls the car_race_collision with the argument 5 and assigns the returned value to the variable **test_n_collisions**. Finally, it prints the value of **test_n_collisions**.
