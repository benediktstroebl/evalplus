```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed.

    Two cars are hitting each other, as previously described.
    The function outputs the collisions.

return number_collisions()
