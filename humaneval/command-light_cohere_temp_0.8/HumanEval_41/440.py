```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    As the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    return: 
    counterclockwise order of collision pairs, return True if there are at least one collision in the current rotation. 
    """
Here's an example usage:
```python
result = car_race_collision(4)
print(result) # True
```
