```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return a number of collisions that occurred.
 we can use the collision between cars to determine the number of collisions.
```

Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the car-race collision problem and passes the test:
