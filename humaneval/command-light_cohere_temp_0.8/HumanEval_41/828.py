This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision scenario with two sets of cars moving in opposite directions on a straight line. The cars have the collision detection and resolution logic, and the function calculates the total number of collisions by simulating the movement of the cars. The test code at the end of the function takes user input for the number of cars in the race and passes the test by printing the output of the function.
