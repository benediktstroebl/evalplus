The code implements a function that simulates a car race collision. It takes two number of cars that start from a straight line and move towards the right simultaneously. When the leftmost car hits the of a right-moving car, a collision occurs. The cars are infinitely strong, so they continue moving along their respective trajectories as if they did not collide. The function returns the number of collisions. It also passes the example and test cases.
