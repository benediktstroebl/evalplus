Here's the Python code to solve the problem:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed and move in their respective direction indefinitely. Two cars will collide if they neither has enough distance and hits the other car moving in the opposite direction. 
    Return the number of collisions.
```

This function takes an integer **n** as an argument and returns the number of collisions between the **n** cars. The logic used here is based on the assumption that the cars are infinitely strong and can keep moving in their direction even after the collision.
