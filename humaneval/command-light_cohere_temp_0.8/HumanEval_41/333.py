```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and direction. 
    A car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, 
    the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory 
    as if they did not collide. The function returns the number of times that collision happens. 

In other words, the function simulates a head-to-head collision between two cars on the road, and returns the count of these collisions. 

When you run this function with a test value of n, you will get the number of collisions, which is the solution to the problem.
