```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars that are moving towards each other will collide and move on as if they did not hit each other. This function outputs the chain reactions of collisions between cars until the list of cars is empty.
```
This Python script defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision. It takes a scenario of multiple cars moving on a straight line, where they collide with each other in a head-to-tail manner. The function outputs the chain reactions of collisions between cars until the list of cars becomes empty.
