```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed.
    When two cars that are moving in opposite directions collide and thus stop moving.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
This function simulates the situation of cars moving on a straight road and colliding with each other. It works by having two cars move towards each other on opposite directions and then simulates the collision, which stops both cars from moving while maintaining their relative position. The function then counts the number of collisions and returns the total number of collisions.
