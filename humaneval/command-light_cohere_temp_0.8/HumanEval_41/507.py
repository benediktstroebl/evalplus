```

This Python code defines a function called `car_race_collision` that simulates a collision between two cars on a straight road. The function takes an integer argument `n` that represents the number of cars involved in the collision. The function then creates an sequence of `n` numbers and uses the `sum` function to calculate the sum of the squares of each element in the sequence. This sum represents the an measure of the "singularity" or "remainder" of the collision.
