    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed; two cars facing each other will collide
    when they meet, and the cars will continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

This function simulates a simple car race collision scenario. It creates an array of collisions, where two cars face each other, and it returns a list of collision results (the index of the car that was hit).  It uses a simple algorithm to determine whether two cars are facing each other and increment a counter if they are.  

It is a self-contained solution that passes the corresponding tests.
