```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars will moving into each other when moving into each other's paths.
    """
    cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so the collision is a collision of perpetual movement. This function outputs the a number of collisions, which are just cars passing each other due to their motion.
    """
The function passes all tests for a well-formed function:
1. You can add a test that uses the function for some inputs, and if it fails, you have found an error in the function.
