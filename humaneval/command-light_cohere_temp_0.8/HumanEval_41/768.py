```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    As the the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    return:
    The function outputs the number of collisions, which is the count of cars that have collided. 
    """
    test cases:
    assert car_race_collision(3) == 2,
    assert car_race_collision(5) == 3,
    assert car_race_collision(6) == 0,
    assert car_race_collision(1) == 0,

    return car_race_collision(10)  # Returns the maximum value the function can return
```

The code defines a function that simulates a car race collision scenario with multiple cars on a straight road. It uses the test cases to validate the function's behavior, and finally, the function is called with a value of 10 to find the maximum number of collisions it would return.
