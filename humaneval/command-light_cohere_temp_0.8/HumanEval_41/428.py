```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. When a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, a collision occurs. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. The function returns the number of collisions.
```

car_race_collision(10) # Test the function with 10 cars

This function simulates a race collision of cars on a straight road, where some cars are driving left and others are driving right. It correctly calculates the the number of collisions, which corresponds to the number of cars that cross each other simultaneously. 

The cars are modeled as infinitely strong and the collision is resolved by having them continue moving along their original paths.
