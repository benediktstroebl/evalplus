```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. Each car moves in the same speed, and two cars will
    collide.

    Two cars will facing collision will the the moment they hit each other, they both continue moving
    in their respective direction as if they didn't collide (thanks to being infinitely
    strong). The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
This Python code defines a function called `car_race_collision` that simulates a scenario of two sets of cars on a straight road that are driving in opposite directions and will collide with each other. 

The function uses a fictitious scenario where two cars moving in opposite directions will collide and, after the collision, continue moving in their respective directions. 

The function takes an argument `n`, which represents the number of cars driving on the road. The cars are assumed to move in opposite directions and will collide with each other when they are sufficiently close to each other. The function simulates this collision by making both cars move together in the same direction after the collision. 

The function then counts the number of collisions and returns the result.
