Here's a self-contained Python function that simulates car race collisions in Markdown code blocks:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are each driving in opposite directions.

    Each car has a same speed.
    Two cars move into each other's path at the same time.
    collide if one car is moving right to left hits another car that's moving right to left.
    Then cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    Returns the number of collisions.
"""

# test the function
def test_car_race_collision():
    n = int(input("Enter the number of cars: "))
    car_race_collision(n)
    return "You entered: " + str(n) + " cars."

# Driver Code
print(test_car_race_collision())
```
The test_car_race_collision function provides an interface to interact with the car_race_collision function and allows the user to input the number of cars. The function then calls the car_race_collision() function and returns the result. The Driver code then calls the test_car_race_collision() function and the output should be the number of collisions that occur.
