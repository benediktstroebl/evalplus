```

This Python function simulates the collision of cars on a straight road. It uses the concept of a race collision, where two cars moving in opposite directions will collide if they are close enough together. The function takes an input `n`, which represents the number of cars on the road. 

The implementation is straightforward: each car is represented as a vector with a magnitude (speed) and a direction (either right or left). The cars will collide when their respective vectors cross each other, and after the collision, both cars will continue moving along their original vectors.

This function can be used to simulate a race collision and calculate the number of cars that have collided. It provides a test to verify the correctness of the implementation by passing different values of `n` and checking the output against the expected result.
