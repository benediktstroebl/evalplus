Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of determining the number of collisions between two sets of cars on a straight road:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are each are driving left to right, simultaneously. entire the same of cars start out being very far from
    each other. All cars have theOF same same speed
    Two cars that are moving towards each other will collide
    if they are heading towards each other.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return:
        collisions = sum(1 for i in range(n)) - n
        return collisions
```
This function calculates the number of collisions by summing up 1's over the range of the number of cars (n) minus the actual number of cars, which gives the number of cars that have collided with each other. The function then returns the formula for the number of collisions between two sets of cars.
