```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    Each car has a same speed. Two cars will intended to collide and move into each other without stopping.

    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```

The above Python script defines a function car_race_collision that simulates a car race collision problem. It takes a imagine a road that is a perfectly straight and infinitely long line. The left and right directions are represented by negatives, and the cars move towards those directions with the same speed. The two cars will collide and move into each other without stopping, and the function counts the number of collisions.

The code uses a nested loop structure to simulate the movement of the cars. The outer loop runs for the number of cars, and the inner loop runs for each car. The inner loop also runs for the number of cars, and it checks if the current car is driving in the opposite direction to the previous car. This process is result in a collision.

Finally, the function returns the number of collisions, which represents the number of cars that have been moved into each other.
