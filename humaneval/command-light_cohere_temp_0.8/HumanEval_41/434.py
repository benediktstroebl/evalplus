```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    These cars are incredibly strong and have the same speed. 
    Two cars are the in collision, they continue moving in their original trajectory. 
    The function returns the expected number of collisions.
 ```
def test_car_race_collision():
    assert car_race_collision(4) == 2
``` 
This code defines a function `car_race_collision` which simulates a race collision between two cars on a straight road. It then has a test function `test_car_race_collision` that checks whether the car_race_collision function with a parameter of 4 returns 2, which is the expected number of collisions based on the scenario where two cars are driving head-to-tail.
