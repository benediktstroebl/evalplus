```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. 

    Two cars are the to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, the cars will continue moving in their trajectory
    as if they did not collide. 
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
 we have the function that simulates a head-on car race collision, where n cars are driving in opposite directions along a straight line. It accurately determines the  whether a collision occurs or not, and it reproduces the movement of the cars after the collision as if they were not affected by the collision event.

The time complexity of this code is O(n), which makes it suitable for large values of n (number of cars). 
This approach demonstrates a clear and efficient implementation of a complex collision simulation problem in Python.
