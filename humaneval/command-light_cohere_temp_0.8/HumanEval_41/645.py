    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    # All cars are in the same speed, and the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

This code defines a function car_race_collision that simulates a car race collision scenario. The function takes an input n, which represents the number of cars on the road. The cars are driving in opposite directions, and the function calculates the number of collisions between them. The test_car_race_collision function is a separate function that tests whether the car_race_collision function returns the correct result when given a positive integer input. The example usage demonstrates how to call the test_car_race_collision function with a user input number of cars and prints the number of collisions.
