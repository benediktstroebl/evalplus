```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. Each car keeps moving at theit, at the same speed, 
    and two cars will collide and keep moving. 
    In this scenario, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong. The function
    number of 
    collisions that occur.

    Parameters:
    n = int, the number of cars on the road. 
    Returns:
    None or an tuple of tuples, each containing the collision pair in
    counterclockwise order.
    """

Here's an example of a function that simulates the scenario of two cars moving towards each other on a straight road. The function returns a number of collisions, or an tuple of collision pairs in counterclockwise order, based on the given number of cars.

For example, if n = 3, the function will return: ([(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)])
This would indicate that cars 0 and 1 collide with each other, and then car 1 collides with car 2.
