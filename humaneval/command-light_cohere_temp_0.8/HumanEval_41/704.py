```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    All cars move in the same speed; two cars are going to collide.
    They collide and then continue moving along their original path. 
    The number of collisions is returned.
```
This code defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision scenario on a straight road. The function takes an parameter `n` which represents the number of cars involved in the collision. 

The behavior is based on the principle that in a head-to-head collision, both cars will continue moving along their original paths. 

The function uses a straightforward simulation to determine the number of collisions based on the relative positions and directions of the cars.
