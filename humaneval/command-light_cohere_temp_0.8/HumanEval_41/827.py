```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed; two cars move in the opposite direction collide.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    The function outputs the number of collisions.

Returns: number of collisions

This Python code defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates a collision between two sets of cars on a straight road. It uses a mathematical approach to determine if two cars driving in opposite directions will collide based on their positions and movement vectors. 

The function calculates the number of collisions using a simple mathematical formula and returns the total count.
