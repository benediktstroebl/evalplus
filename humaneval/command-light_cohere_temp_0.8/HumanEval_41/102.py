    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed, and two cars are determined to collide based on the driving direction.

    When the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return the number of collisions.

    also, return a boolean array that shows whether each car had a collision during the race.

```
This code implements a car race collision detection algorithm in Python. It defines a car_race_collision() function that calculates the collision status of n cars driving on a straight road. The colliding cars are determined based on their relative directions, and the output is a list of collision flags for each car. The test_car_race_collision() function passes the test by checking if all cars have collisions.
