```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return number of collisions
   
    """
    Here is a detailed explanation of the function's operation:
    - The function takes an integer n as input, which represents the number of cars on the road.
    - The set of n cars driving left represent the left-driving cars, and the set of n cars driving right represent the right-driving cars.
    - The set of cars start out being very far from each other, as if they were initially placed at different points along the infinitely long road.
    - The cars moving left to right hit the right-driving cars, but since the cars are infinitely strong, they continue moving in their respective directions as if they did not collide.
    - The function outputs the number of collisions, which represents the number of cars that have collided with each other.
    """
    test case, which is to see if the function works correctly. 
The test case can be modified to fit different scenarios, but the function should always provide the correct number of collisions.
