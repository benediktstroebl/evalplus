```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. Each car keeps moving at the { in the same speed and starts out from
    a very large distance from each other. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, 
    as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. 

    function outputs the only the number of collisions.
```
This script defines a function car_race_collision that simulates a collision between n cars on a road. The cars move in opposite directions and collide with each other, but continue moving along their paths. The function outputs the number of collisions, which is the number of cars that have collided with each other.
