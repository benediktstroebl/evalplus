    # Based on the principle of object collision, two drivers will collide

    collide = 1
    Now we will create a list of n randomly selected positive numbers, except 0,
    starting from 1. Then, we will check whether collide[i] and collide[j] are equal, where i and j vary from 1 to n.

    # Once two drivers meet each other head to head, they will continue moving in the same direction
    # after collision. So, we need to calculate the final position of each driver after collision.
