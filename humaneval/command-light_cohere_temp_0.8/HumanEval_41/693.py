```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    
    If two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and do not slow down or accelerate. 
    
    Two cars intended to collide with each other are identified. The first car that is moving left to right hits the second car that is driving right to left. The second car continues moving, while the first car is stationary.

    The function outputs the number of the collisions.
```

This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a race collision of two cars on a straight road. The function uses the concept of the road being a line and the cars driving towards each other. It assumes that the collision is determined by the relative directions of the cars. 

The function also checks if the number of collisions is equal to the number of cars, and the cars are all driving in the same direction.
