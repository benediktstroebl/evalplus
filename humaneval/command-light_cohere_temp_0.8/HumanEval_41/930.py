```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and travel along the same speed. 

    two cars are that are moving towards each other collide and continue moving in their respective directions.

    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
This Python code defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates a head-to-head collision between two vehicles on a straight road. The vehicles are moving in opposite directions, and the function determines when and how the collision occurs, then both vehicles continue moving along their original paths. The function outputs the number of collisions, which is the number of times the two vehicles pass each other.
