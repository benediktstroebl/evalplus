# Run the function and test the result
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(input("Enter number of cars: "))
    result = car_race_collision(n)
    print(f"Number of collisions: {result}")
```
The function car_race_collision calculates the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions on a straight road. The number of collisions is returned as the result of the function.

The function is then tested with a set of test values, and the result is printed out.
