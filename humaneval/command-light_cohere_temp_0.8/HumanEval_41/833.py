```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 

    two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed; two cars heading toward each other will collide when they hit each other. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```

This Python code defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates a head-to-head collision between two vehicles on an infinite straight road. It follows the scenario where two sets of cars are moving towards each other on the same road. The vehicles are infinitely strong and resilient, so they keep moving in their original paths even after the collision. The code outputs the number of collisions that occur in the simulation.
