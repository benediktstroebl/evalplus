This Python code defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a road with cars moving in opposite directions and colliding with each other. It is a scenario where two cars are moving towards each other along a straight road. The function takes an input `n`, which represents the number of cars on the road, and uses this input to determine the number of collisions that will occur. 

The `test_collision` function is used to test the correctness of the `car_race_collision` function by calling it with a given value of `n`. It checks whether the number of collisions calculated by `car_race_collision` matches the expected value of `n`.

The code also includes a driver code section where the user is prompted to enter the number of cars, and the `test_collision` function is called to check if the function passed the test or not.
