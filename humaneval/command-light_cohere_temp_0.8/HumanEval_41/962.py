```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 

    two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed; two cars move to collide
    when one car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    The function outputs the number of the collisions.
```

This Python code defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision scenario. It takes a scenario of multiple cars moving along a straight road, with some driving towards each other and colliding if they meet head-to-head. The function takes an input parameter `n` representing the number of cars in the race. It then iterates through pairs of cars, checks if the current car is driving towards the opposite direction of the other car, and if so, it counts the collision and updates the state variable. The code is designed to handle an infinite number of cars and collisions, and it will output the total count of collisions.
