This code defines a function called `car_race_collision`, which simulates a collision of cars on a road. The function takes an parameter `n` representing the number of cars on the road. The cars drive in opposite directions, and the function calculates the number of collisions that occurred and returns the result. The function then has a nested helper function `test_collision` that takes an input `n` and asserts that the output of `car_race_collision` function is equal to the expected result. This function can be used to test the code and pass the test.
