```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed. A car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, but they are infinitely sturdy and strong.
    Therefore, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    Return the number of collisions.
    """Then, return the total number of collisions.
```

This code is well-structured and easy to understand. It defines a function `car_race_collision` that takes an integer `n` as an argument and returns the total number of collisions. This function simulates the scenario of a road with parallel cars moving in opposite directions. The cars are assumed to collide with each other, but they are infinitely strong and will continue moving along their original paths. The function outputs the number of collisions that occurred in this scenario, which is the total number of cars that were involved in the collision.
