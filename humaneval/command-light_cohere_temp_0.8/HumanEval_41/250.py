Here's the provided Python script:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed; two cars will collide and merge as they meet,
    continuing to move in their original direction. This function outputs the the number of the collisions.
```
This script defines a function car_race_collision that simulates a car race scenario. It takes an input n, which represents the number of cars on the road. The function creates two sets of cars, driving in opposite directions and at the same speed. It checks for collisions between these cars and simulates the collision by merging the two cars into one. The function then outputs the number of collisions that occurred during the race.
