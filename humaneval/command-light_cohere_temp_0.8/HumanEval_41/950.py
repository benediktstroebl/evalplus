```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars have the same in the same speed
    and start out being very far from each other. 
    Two cars will the do collide and continue moving in their trajectory.
    The function outputs the collisions, and returns True if all collisions happened, and False otherwise.
```
This function simulates the race collision problem, given a set of `n` cars. It works as follows:
1. The function takes an parameter `n` that represents the number of cars involved in the collision.

2 Each car starts out from rest, driving towards the opposite direction of the road (left to right or right to left).

3 The cars move towards each other at a constant speed.

4 When a car that is moving left to right hits a car that is moving right to left, a collision occurs.

5 The cars are infinitely strong, so they continue moving in their respective directions after the collision.

6 The function counts the number of collisions and returns True if all collisions happened, and False otherwise.

7 The function simulates the collision between the cars for a certain number of steps.

This function can be used to solve the car race collision problem and pass the corresponding tests.
