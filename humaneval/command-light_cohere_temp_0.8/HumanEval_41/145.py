```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    These two two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed, and two cars will collide as they meet on the road. When a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, the cars will continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return number of collisions that occur.
```

The above Python script defines a function called **car_race_collision** that simulates a collision between two cars on a straight road. It works by assuming that there are two sets of n cars driving in opposite directions along a straight line. When the cars meet, they will collide, and the cars will continue moving in their respective directions as if they did not collide. 

The function returns the number of collisions that occurred. 

This is a self-contained solution to the problem of calculating the number of collisions in a car race scenario.
