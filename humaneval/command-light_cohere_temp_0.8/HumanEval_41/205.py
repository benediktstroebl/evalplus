```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    Two cars are the collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. 
    The number of collisions is the output of the function.
```

def test_car_race_collision():
    assert car_race_collision(6) == 2
```
This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates the collisions of cars on a straight road. The `test_car_race_collision` function is a simple assert that checks if the `car_race_collision` function with argument 6 returns 2. 

This function can be easily modified to test with different values of n and verify the correctness of the output.
