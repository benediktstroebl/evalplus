```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    These two cars have the numbers, each car is moving at its own constant speed. 
    When two cars are moving towards each other
    on the road. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    The function returns True if there are no collisions, else returns the number of collisions.
```

This function uses Python's "induction" to solve a logical problem. The core idea is that if we consider one car, it will either collide or not (if it collides with the other car, it will move in its own direction and the other car will also move in its own direction).
