This code defines a function called **car_race_collision** that simulates the collision of cars on a straight road. The function creates two lists, one for cars driving leftwards and another for cars driving rightwards. It then iterates through the cars from both lists and counts the number of collisions. The code is self-contained and can be used to solve the car race collision problem for any given number of cars.
