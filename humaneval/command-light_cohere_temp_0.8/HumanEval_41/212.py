    Two cars want to collide when moving cars hit each other.

This Python code introduces a function `car_race_collision`, which simulates a car race collision scenario on a straight road. The `driver_left` and `driver_right` functions represent the driving behaviors of cars on the left and right sides, respectively. Each car starts with an value of `0` ( indicating that it's not yet driven) and iterates through the provided number of cars, checking if the current car is `0`. The `driver_left` function adds `1` to the left side's cars, while the `driver_right` function adds `1` to the right side's cars. The `cars` list is initialized with the first car's index set to `1` and the remaining `n - 1` cars. The output is the number of collisions between the cars, which are determined by the number of cars that have been driven and the number of cars on the opposing side. The code defines a cars as a list and initializes it with the first car's index set to `1` and the remaining `n - 1` cars. The `driver_left` and `driver_right` functions are then called, representing the driving behavior of the cars. The code calculates the total number of collisions between the cars and prints the result.
