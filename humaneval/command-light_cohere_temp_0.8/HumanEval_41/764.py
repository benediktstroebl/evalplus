```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    These function outputs the Recursively counts how many cars have colliding and prints the result.
```

# Testing
n = int(input())
count = car_race_collision(n)
print(f"Number of collisions: {count}")

This function simulates the scenario of a road with two directions of cars moving at the same speed. The function then counts the number of collisions and prints the result, which is the number of cars that have collided.
