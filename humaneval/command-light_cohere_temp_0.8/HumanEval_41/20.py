```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    Two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars will heading towards each collision
    if a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    We'll see that the result, they will continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    Returns the number of collisions.
```

This function accepts an integer **n** as an argument and determines the total number of collisions in the race of cars. The function also accepts the test that verifies it passes.
