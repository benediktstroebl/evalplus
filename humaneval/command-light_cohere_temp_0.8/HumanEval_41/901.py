Here's the self-contained Python function:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars facing each to collide will do so when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return: 
    collides = []
    for i in range(n):
        x = i * (len(road) - 1)
        y = n - i
        collides.append([x + (x, y])
    return collides
```
The function simulates a race collision between n cars on a straight road. It creates a list collides, which stores the result of the collision. The function runs in a loop, where it calculates the starting position and ending position for each car, and appends the result to collides. The function then returns the number of collisions.
