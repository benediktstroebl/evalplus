```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    As two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
This Python code defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates a basic scenario of car collisions on a straight road. It is intended to represent a simplified model of a racing track with cars moving towards each other. The function takes an integer n as input, which represents the number of cars involved in the collision. 

The output of the function is the number of collisions between the cars, which could vary based on the specific values of n. 

This code is a simple and compact way to model and solve this type of problem.
