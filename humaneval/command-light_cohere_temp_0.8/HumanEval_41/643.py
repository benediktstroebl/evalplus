```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. Each car moves in the same speed
    Two cars are driving to collide, and they meet perfectly as if there are no friction.  When infinitely sturdy and strong, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    The function returns True if the collisions happen, False otherwise.
    """ return collisions
