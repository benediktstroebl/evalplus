Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of finding the number of collisions between two sets of cars on a straight road, given their respective initial positions:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are each in a race, driving right to left and left to right.
    simultaneously, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    The function outputs the number of collisions that occurred.
    """
    cars are moving into each other's path.
    n = int(input("Enter the number of cars: "))
    print("The number of collisions is: " + n)
```
This script defines a function car_race_collision that takes an integer n as input, representing the number of cars on the race track. It then asks the main user to enter the number of cars they want to use in the race. The cars are then driving in opposite directions and are infinitely strong, so they will continue moving in their respective directions even after colliding with each other. 
The function outputs the number of collisions between the cars.
