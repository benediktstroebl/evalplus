```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. 
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
The script defines a function called car_race_collision that takes an integer n as input. The function simulates a race of n cars on a straight road, where some cars are driving in opposite directions. The cars are represented as having infinite strength, so they will continue moving in their direction even after colliding with another car. The function then counts the number of collisions between the cars and returns the number of collisions as the output.
