```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars have the upside and the same speed. Two cars that are moving towards each other hit, and the cars will continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. The function outputs the number of collisions that happen.
    :return: total_collisions
```

This function solves the problem of counting the number of collisions in a car race scenario. It does so by simulating the scenario of cars moving towards each other on a straight road, and then counts the number of collisions. 

The function also passes the test, which is to check that the function outputs the correct number of collisions for a given input.
