```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. All cars have the approaching speeds that are the same.
    Two cars move in opposite directions to collide. When a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, the two cars will continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. This is time to simulate a collision.
    return len([map[c] == 2 and map[0] == c and map[1] == c for c in map[c]))

# Test the function
test_cases = [10, 20, 30]
result = car_race_collision(test_cases)
print(result)
```

This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates car racing, with two cars moving in opposite directions to collide. The function returns `True` if two cars at the start of the road are moving toward each other and collide with each other. The test cases provided are integers that represent the number of cars on the road. The function is then passed these test cases, and the result is printed.
