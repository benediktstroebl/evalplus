```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and are infinitely sturdy and strong. Two cars will moving toward collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates the collision of two cars on a straight road. It uses the test cases to ensure that the function works correctly.
