This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that models the scenario of cars moving towards each other on a straight road. The `test_collision` function is a test driver for the `car_race_collision` function. 

The `test_collision` function takes a test case dictionary as input and checks that the input matches the expected structure. The test case dictionary contains two lists: one with cars driving leftwards and the other driving rightwards. 

The function then uses assert statements to check if the lists have the same length and if they are equal up to the length of the other list.
