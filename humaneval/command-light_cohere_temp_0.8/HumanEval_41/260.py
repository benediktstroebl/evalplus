    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed; 
    two cars that are moving towards each other collide. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, 
    so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

This Python script defines a function `car_race_collision` which simulates a scenario of cars racing on a straight road. 

The function takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of cars on the road. 

The cars are moving in opposite directions, and the function calculates the number of collisions between them. 

The function simulates the scenario of cars moving towards each other and colliding, and it returns the number of collisions that occurred. 

The script then takes an input `n` and calls the `car_race_collision` function with this input. It prints the number of collisions to the console.
