```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    These two both sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. 

    function outputs the time of collision that occurs between a car moving left to right and a car moving right to left. 

    number of cars, which can collide is n.
``` 
This function appears to be in charge of resolving the car collision scenario of the race track challenge, in which two cars travelling in opposite directions collide. The function is used to return the total number of collisions, which is the outcome of the cars colliding.
