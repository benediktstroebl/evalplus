```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.
    Two cars are the collision. 
    - All cars are in the same lane move toward each other until they meet the 
       next car. When they meet, they continue moving in their original direction
    (as if nothing happened).
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```

This Python code defines a function called **car_race_collision** that simulates a head-to-head collision between two vehicles on a straight road. The code uses the information about the vehicles' direction and the speed to determine if a collision occurred. It then outputs the results with the number of collisions.
