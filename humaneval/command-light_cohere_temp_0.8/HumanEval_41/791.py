```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, a collision occurs. The cars continue moving due their same speed afterwards, and the collision time is negligible.
    }
The function outputs the number of collisions.

```
This Python function, car_race_collision, models the motion of cars on a straight road. It simulates the scenario of cars driving in opposite directions and colliding with each other. The function takes an input of the number of cars (n) and uses this value to determine the number of cars and their relative positions. The cars are modeled as infinitely strong and their motion is represented by continuing to move along their respective trajectories. 

The function also accounts for the negligible collision time and outputs the total count of collisions, which represents the number of cars that have collided with each other. 

This function is self-contained and can be used to solve the car-race collision problem for a given number of cars.
