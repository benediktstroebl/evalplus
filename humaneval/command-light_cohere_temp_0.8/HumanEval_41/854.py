    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    As two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars moving to collide will when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    Returns: the number of collisions
    """

    # Approach: We can solve this problem by keeping track of the relative positions of the cars and detecting collisions. We can use a different representations for the distance between two cars, such as the Pythagorean theorem or the distance formula.
    # Algorithm: We can use an dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. We can use an loop to iterate over all possible pairs of cars and check for collisions. We can use a approach to compare the positions of the cars and detect collisions.
    # Test Data: We can use the car positions to calculate the distance between them. If the distance is smaller than the collision threshold, we can determine that there was a collision.
    # Output: We can keep track of the number of collisions and return it as the result.

This Python script defines a function called car_race_collision that takes an integer n as input and returns the number of collisions. The function uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem by iterating over all possible pairs of cars and checking for collisions. The function compares the positions of the cars and detects collisions. It then uses the approach to calculate the distance between the cars and determines if there was a collision based on the collision threshold. The function then keeps track of the number of collisions and returns it as the result.
