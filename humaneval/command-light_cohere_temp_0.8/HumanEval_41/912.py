```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars that are moving towards each other collide and keep moving along their original paths.

    return True collisions between any cars. The function outputs a number of collisions, which is the number of cars that had a collision.
```

# Test the function
def test_car_race_collision():
    assert car_race_collision(4) == 2  # Should return 2

# Test the function with different values of n
assert car_race_collision(10) == 5  # Should return 5

This code defines a function that simulates a car race collision scenario. It takes a time two cars to collide, the function returns the number of collisions. The test_car_race_collision function is a placeholder to test the car_race_collision function. The test_function verifies that the output of the car_race_collision function is correct.
