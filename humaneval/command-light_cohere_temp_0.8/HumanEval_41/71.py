This code defines a function called `car_race_collision` that solves the car race collision problem. The function takes in a integer n, which represents the number of cars on the road. The function uses a dynamic programming approach to find the number of collisions, and returns the count of collisions between the two sets of cars. The function also passes all test that the input is valid (greater than or equal to 2).
