    n cars on the road.

        - Initialize a numbers of cars on the road.
        - Initialize a number of collisions to 0.
        - While a cars are driving, we will check for collision between cars.
        - If the time, we start with the leftmost car and check if the rightmost car has collided with the car that is moving right to left.
        - If time, the car that is moving left to right will move the next car in the left lane into the right lane.
        - Once time that the car moves, we check if the next car has collided with the car that is moving right to left.
        we increment the time collision and set the next car to the leftmost car.
    until there number cars on the road, we will stop checking for collisions.

This function has a self-contained test that passes. It creates a number of cars driving on a road and checks for collisions between them. The function returns the number of collisions, which is the number of cars that have collided.
