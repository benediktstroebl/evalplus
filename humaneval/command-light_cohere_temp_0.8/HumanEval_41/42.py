```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 

    all cars have the same speed, and two cars are heading to collide. 

    The function outputs whether two cars collide, or not.
    The two cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. 
    Returns True collision or4 result. 

    expected return is the result of calling this function with the input values n=4 and n=3.
 it should return 2
