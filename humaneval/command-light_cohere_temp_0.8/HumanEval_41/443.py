```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. All cars move in same same speed. Two cars will moving to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return:
    All the cars start out being very far from each other. The first car starts moving right to left, and the second car starts moving right to left.
    collidesWhen after it collides. The car that has finished moving, the first car starts moving in the opposite direction, and vice versa. The function outputs the number of collisions that happen.
```
This code provides a solution to the car race collision problem, which is to determine the number of collisions between two sets of cars driving towards each other on a straight road.
