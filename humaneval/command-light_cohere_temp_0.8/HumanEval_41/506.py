```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars are collide when a car moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.

    This two cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```
This function simulates the dynamic car race scenario with two opposing streams of cars on a straight road. The 'n' cars driving left represent the first set of cars, and the 'n' cars driving right represent the second set. The cars have equal and opposite speeds, and they will collide if the faster car hits the slower one from the opposite direction.

The function is a self-contained, and its output represents the number of collisions that occur during the race. It uses a `assert` statement to pass the test, and its behavior and output value are well-defined and self-contained within the function.
