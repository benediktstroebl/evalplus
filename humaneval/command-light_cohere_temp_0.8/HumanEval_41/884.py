    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed; two cars heading toward each other will collide.
    If time, they collide, they will move apart, continuing to move in their original direction.

This Python script defines a function `car_race_collision` that checks whether any pairs of cars in a fleet of `n` vehicles started driving towards each other simultaneously, collide with each other. The function returns `True` if there were any collisions, and `False` otherwise.
