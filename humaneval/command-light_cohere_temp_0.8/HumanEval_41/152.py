    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars have the expected velocities: v_1 = 2, v_2 = -2, v_3 = 4, and v_4 = -4.
    The function outputs the result is the number of collisions.
    Each collision is represented by pairs of cars (i, j) that collide.
    For example, the first collision would be (1, 2), the second one would be (1, 3), and so on.
