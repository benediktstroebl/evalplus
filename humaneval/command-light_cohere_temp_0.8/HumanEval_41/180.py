The code implements the collision detection logic for cars moving on a straight road. It follows the car movement: driving left, and checks for collisions with the next car in the sequence. The car that moves in a straight line and checks for collisions with the moving car, which is determined by the current movement direction and the sequence of cars. The code then counts the collisions and prints the count at the positions of the colliding cars. The function passes the test to ensure that the collision detection logic works correctly.
