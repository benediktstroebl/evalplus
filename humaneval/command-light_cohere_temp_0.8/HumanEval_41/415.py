Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of counting the number of cars colliding on a road that is a perfectly straight infinitely long line:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    # There each sets of cars start out being very far from each other. 
    All cars move in the same speed. When a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, the collision will be a zero- collision.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    return: return n
```

This script defines a function car_race_collision that takes in a parameter n, representing the number of cars on the road. The function outputs the number of collisions, which is the number of cars that have collided with each other. 

This code is self-contained, and it does not require any external inputs or dependencies.
