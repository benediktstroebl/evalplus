```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed; two cars move toward each other and collide. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return: 
        -Count of collisions: The number of cars colliding with each other.
        - First car: The first car to move right.
        - Second car: The second car to move right.
        - Third car: The third car to move right.
        - Fourth car: The first car to move left.
        - Fifth car: The second car to move left.
        - Sixth car: The third car to move left.
        - The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return time complexity: The time complexity of this function is O(n^2), as it iterates over all pairs of n cars.

This problem is an instance of the Hamiltonian Path Problem, which is a classic example in computational complexity. The solution provided is a dynamic programming approach, using an optimal substructure known as the "Scanner's Sweeper" algorithm.
