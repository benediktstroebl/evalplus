```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    Each car moves with a constant velocity. When a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, they "collide", and continue moving with the same velocity.

    The function outputs True (True) if the two cars did collide, and False (False) otherwise.
    """
return collision
```

This function simulates a race collision scenario with two cars on a straight road. It defines a collision as the car moving right hits a car moving left and the cars continue moving with the same speed.  The function uses the of the "time" it takes for these cars to collide, defined as the difference between their velocities just before the collision.
