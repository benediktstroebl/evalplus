```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):

    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed and are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    The function outputs the number of collisions.

    def car_race_collision(num_cars: int) -> int:
        collisions = 0
        # All n cars are initially positioned evenly
        for i in range(num_cars):
            left, right = i*2, (i+1)*2
            car_position = [left,right]
            car_neighbors = [car_position[1:] for car_position in [left,right]*num_cars]
            for neighbor in car_neighbors:
                if (car_position[0] == neighbor[0]) or (car_position[1] == neighbor[1]):

This code defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision scenario. It takes n cars moving simultaneously, driving towards opposite directions along a straight line. The function uses a initial car positions and their neighbors' positions to determine if a collision occurred. It marks a number of collisions as the number of cars that were driving left and right at the same time and had their positions overlap. The script follows a mathematical logic of collision detection and returns the count of collisions as the result.
