```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed; two cars are determined to collide when moving towards each other. 
    The function outputs the number of collisions
    """
    return sum(1 for _ in range(n) if abs(x - y) <= car_radius for x, y in points)
```
This function calculates the number of collisions between moving cars on a road using the formula for the collision of two objects. The time it moves n cars, the function uses a generator expression and a conditional statement to determine if the cars are close enough to collide. The function then counts the number of collisions and returns the result.

This self-contained function can be used to solve the car collision problem in a markdown code block.
