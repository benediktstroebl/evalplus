```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars have the actual collision, as they're infinitely strong and durable, so they continue moving in their respective trajectories.
    The function outputs the collision count.

def test_car_race_collision(n: int):
    return car_race_collision(n) == n
```

The function car_race_collision calculates the number of collisions between two sets of n cars moving towards each other along a straight road. The function assumes that cars are infinitely strong and durable, so they will continue moving in their respective directions even after colliding with another car. 

The function is tested using the test_car_race_collision function, which passes the test by comparing the output of the car_race_collision function with the expected number of collisions (n).
