```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    They all start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. The two cars move in opposite directions, collide and continue moving in their respective directions.
    """
    
    # Test case 1
    There are n = 3 cars on the road. Three cars are moving in a row from left to right, and they all collide with each other. The result should be the same:
    print(f"Test case 1 pass: {collisions}")
    # Test case 2
    n = 5
    collisions = car_race_collision(n)
    print(f"Test case 2 pass: {collisions}")
    # Test case 3
    n = 3
    collisions = car_race_collision(n, 0.0)
    print(f"Test case 3 pass: {collisions}")
```

The script defines a function `car_race_collision`, which simulates a road with cars moving towards each other. It then runs three test cases to check if the output of the function is as expected. The output should be the series of lines with the number of collisions for each test case.
