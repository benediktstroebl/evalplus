```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed and direction, so they will never collide. 
    Instead, they will 'pass' each other, creating a new point on the line.
    match any previous car
    Therefore the end of the road.
    This function outputs the `n` collision points.
    """

```
This function, `car_race_collision`, accepts an integer `n` and calculates the number of collisions, which is then returned. It uses a `n` cars driving `left` to `right` and a different `n` cars driving `right` to `left`, and then checks if they collided or not. 

The function works by comparing the car currently at the `left` end of the road with the car currently at the `right` end. If the cars are driving on the same direction, they will never collide. If they are driving in opposite directions, they will pass each other, creating a new point on the road.
