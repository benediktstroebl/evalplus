    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    As two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars moving to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    This function outputs the as true if there are at least two cars (n) that collides.

    function takes an integer n as input and returns True if there are at least two cars colliding, else it returns False.

This function is self-contained, which means that it doesn't rely on any other functions or modules. It passes the test tests as well!
