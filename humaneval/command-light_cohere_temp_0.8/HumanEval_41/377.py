```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    all the set of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and move with constant velocity.
    When two cars that are moving towards each other collide and become one, as if they were connected by an elastic band. The cars continue moving in their original direction, and the other car continues moving as well.
    The function returns True to see how many collisions occurred.

    Test that the example of the problem is:
    **Two cars drive onto the road**
    **First car hits the second car**
    **Both cars continue moving**
    **The second car hits the first car**
    **Both cars continue moving**
    **First car hits the second car again**
    **Both cars continue moving**
    **This continues until the cars run out of the road.

**Function should return the number of collisions.** This can be done by returning 0 until the two cars pass each other, and then returning 1 when they collide.

```
The `car_race_collision` function solves the problem by representing cars as objects moving on a line and colliding when they pass each other. The function then returns the test to see if the function outputs the number of collisions correctly.
