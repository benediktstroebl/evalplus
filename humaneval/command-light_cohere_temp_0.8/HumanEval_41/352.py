def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed; two cars
    are going to collide. When a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left,
    they will collide.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    The function outputs the collision time.

    function outputs the number of collisions and collision time
