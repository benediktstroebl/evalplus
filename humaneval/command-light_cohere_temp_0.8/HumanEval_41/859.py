```
This function simulates a collision between two sets of cars on a road, where each car drives towards the right and collides with every other car on the road exactly once. The function ensures that all the cars drive toward the right side of the road and collide with each other exactly once, and that there are no other collisions after the first one.

This function is self-contained and will output the number of collisions when provided with the number of cars driving towards each other.
