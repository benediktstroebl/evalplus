Here is a Python script that demonstrates a self-contained function that simulates a car race collision scenario, passing the test case:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. All cars have the experiencing no collisions, and continue moving
    in their original direction.

    This function simulates a collision of a car that's moving left to right with another car that's moving right to left.
    it returns True number of collisions.

# Example case:
n = int(input("Enter the number of cars: "))
# Simulate car race collision
collisions = car_race_collision(n)
print("The number of collisions is:", collisions)

# Test case:
if collisions == 0:
    print("Correct! All cars collided.")
else:
    print("Incorrect. Not all cars collided.")

```
This script defines a function car_race_collision that simulates a car race collision. It takes an input of the number of cars, and then returns the number of collisions.

The script also includes a test case that checks whether the number of collisions is zero, which means all cars collided.

Note that this script is a simple implementation and can be improved to handle more complex scenarios and perform more tests.
