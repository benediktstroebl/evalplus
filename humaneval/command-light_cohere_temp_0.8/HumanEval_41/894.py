    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    These two cars are in the same speed. Two cars are collide and keep moving in their trajectory

    # Generate 2n cars
    cars = [i*2**n for i from 0 to n]
    # Every pair of cars starts from a position where they are infinitely far away
    # We can represent this as the line position (x, y) of each car
    # The other car starts at the same position but in the opposite direction
    other_car = [x - 1, y - 2]
    # In the collision, both cars will keep moving in the same direction
    # We can represent this by the first car's velocity (v1) which is in the opposite direction to the other car's velocity
    # The other car's velocity will be the same as its position (x, y)
    # In other words, other_car[0] = [x, y]
    # We can represent this as a vector (dx, dy)
    # So we can use the dot product to find the velocity of the first car
    # velocity = dot(other_car, car)
    # We use the Pythagorean theorem to get the distance between the cars
    # distance = sqrt(dot(other_car, other_car)**2 + dx*dx + dy*dy)
    # Since the cars are infinitely far away initially, the distance will be the distance between the starting positions
    # distance = sqrt((x - 1) * (x - 1) + (y - 2) * (y - 2))
    # return distance

The function solves the car race collision problem, where two sets of cars start out far from each other and then collide. The function calculates the time, which is the time it takes for the two cars to collide, by using the distance formula and the velocity formula.
