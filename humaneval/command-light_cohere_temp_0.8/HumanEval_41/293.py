This Python code defines a function called "car_race_collision" that simulates a collision between two sets of cars on a straight road. The cars start out from rest and move towards each other. The function takes an input of the number of cars and uses that value to determine the number of collisions that occur. The user is prompted to enter the number of cars and the function then outputs the count of collisions that have occurred.
