```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed; two cars meet in the middle of the road and collide.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.

# Test the function with an input of n=5.
test_collision(5)
