    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and direction. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the time of collision.

This Python code defines a function called `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision scenario. It takes a critical observation that the function creates two separate lists, `right_cars` and `collision_times`, to keep track of the rightmost car indices and the times of collisions respectively. 

It adds the rightmost car indices to the `right_cars` list and uses a loop to move each car in the sequence. The function then uses another loop to move each car on the left, calculating the new position based on the current position and the direction of movement. 

The function checks for collisions by comparing the current car's position with the position of the rightmost car in the sequence. If a collision is detected, it adds the corresponding velocity to the `collision_times` list. Finally, the function returns the `collision_times`, which represents the number of collisions and their corresponding times.
