```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed, and 2 cars will collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return:
        coll = 0
        for i in range(n):
            car1 = i % n
            car2 = n - car1 -1
            if car1 == car2:
                coll += 1
        return coll
```

This Python code defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision scenario. It takes the a process, it creates a list of cars' positions, and then checks for collision pairs using the modulo operation. If a same car is at another position, it adds 1 to the `collisions` count. The function returns the result, representing the total number of collisions that occurred during the race.
