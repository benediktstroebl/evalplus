Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function `car_race_collision` that solves the problem you've outlined in markdown code block:

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    Two cars want to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    Return the the mathematical approach: 
    Return the number of collisions between pairs of cars
    """
    return 2 * (n // 2)
```

This script defines a function that calculates the number of collisions between pairs of cars on a straight road. The function uses a mathematical approach to determine the number of collisions, where two cars are considered to collide if they are moving toward each other along the road. 

Please note that this implementation assumes the cars are infinitely strong and do not come to a complete halt; otherwise, you might want to model different physics.
