This Python script defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates a head-to-head car collision. It takes a the specific rules, it creates two cars, each with its position and speed, and then checks for a collision between the two cars. The function returns the number of collisions or if there are no collisions, it returns 0. 

The test_collision function is then called with an argument of 5 and the result is printed. This will simulate the a collision between 5 cars.
