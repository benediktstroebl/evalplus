```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.
    All cars have the  the same speed and are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they
    continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    return: return the number of collisions
