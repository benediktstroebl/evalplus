This Python script defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision scenario. It uses nested loops to create a list of cars, ensuring they start out evenly and drive in opposite directions. Then, it iterates through pairs of cars and checks if they collide, counting the collision as a result. Finally, it returns the number of collisions.

The function is then tested with different values of `n`, and the output is printed. The output will be the number of collisions, which is the expected behavior of the function.
