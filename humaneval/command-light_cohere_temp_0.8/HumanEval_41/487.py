```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. All cars move in the same speed.
    The two cars are driving to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    return: the number of collisions.
    """ The number of cars that were driving to collide with each other.
    """
    function solves the problem by finding the collisions of cars driving to the left and right, and returns the number of collisions.
