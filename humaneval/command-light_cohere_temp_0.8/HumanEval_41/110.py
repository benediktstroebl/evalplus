```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed. Two cars are intersecting. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return: The number of the collisions is returned.
```
The code you provided defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a head-to-head collision between two cars on a straight road. It uses the scenario of two cars moving towards each other at the same speed. The collision is resolved based on the strength and stability of the cars, and each car continues moving in its direction after the collision.
