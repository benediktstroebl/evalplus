This script defines a self-contained Python function that simulates a car race collision problem. The function takes in two sets of positions, checks for collisions between them, and returns `True` if a collision occurred, indicating that the cars are in the correct order. The function uses a mathematical approach to determine the collision and meets the test that cars are driving towards each other.
