This Python script defines a function called `car_race_collision` that simulates a head-to-head car collision scenario on a straight road. It uses nested loops to simulate the movement of n cars towards each other, and then determines the number of collisions between these cars. The function outputs the number of collisions. The script then takes input from the user for the number of cars, and passes this value through to the function.

This code is a good starting point for solving the car collision problem, and it can be further improved and customized to fit specific requirements or constraints.
