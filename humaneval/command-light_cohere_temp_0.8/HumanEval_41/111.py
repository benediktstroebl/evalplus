```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed; two cars will collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return number of collisions
   
    """Return the number of collisions, which represents the number of cars that have collided. 
"""
return 0
```
This Python code defines a function called `car_race_collision` that simulates a collision between two sets of cars on a straight road. It uses the specific scenario where two groups of cars are driving towards each other along a straight line. 

The cars are assumed to have infinite strength and will continue moving in the same direction unless they collide. 

The function returns the number of collisions, which could potentially happen due to the cars colliding with each other.
