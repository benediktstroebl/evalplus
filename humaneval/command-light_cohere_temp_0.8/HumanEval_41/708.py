This script defines a function called car_race_collision, which simulates the collision of n cars driving on a straight road. The function takes an input n, which represents the number of cars involved in the collision. The output of the function is the number of collisions that occur in the simulation.

The script then provides a set of test cases, with different values of n. The script then loops through each test case, calls the car_race_collision function with the corresponding value of n, and compares the actual number of collisions with the expected number of collisions.

Finally, the script prints out a message indicating whether all tests have passed or failed, based on the comparison of the actual and expected numbers of collisions.
