```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    As the two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed.
    When cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    return: A list of tuples, each containing two elements: a tuple (index of car, direction it was going), 
    corresponds to the state of each car after collision.
    Test that the the state of each car is unchanged after collision, 
    and the function returns True.
 we'll use the list comprehension to check this property
    :return: return all( [isinstance(car_state, CarState) for CarState in car_states])
    and returns False
