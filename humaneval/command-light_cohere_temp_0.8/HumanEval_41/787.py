    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars that are moving towards each other collide and their motion is interchanged. They continue moving in their same direction as if they didn't collide. This process repeats infinitely.

    The function outputs the number of collisions

```
This code defines a function that simulates car races on a straight road. The function works by simulating two sets of cars moving towards each other on the road. The cars collide and their motion is exchanged, and the cars continue moving in the same direction. The test function passes when the number of collisions (6) is correctly outputted by the function with the provided number of cars (4) and the number of collisions is (6).
