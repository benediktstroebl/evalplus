```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed and behave in a manner such that they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. 
    These function outputs thea number of collisions.
    return sum(c.speed(i, i in i < n) > (n-i) * (n-i -1)
