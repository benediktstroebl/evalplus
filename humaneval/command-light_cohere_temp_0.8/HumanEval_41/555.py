```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and continue moving in their direction (left to right) as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the value indicating the number of collisions.
    """. 

:param n: int 
:return: int
```
The function checks if the number of cars is even. If it is, it returns 0, indicating no collision. If it's odd, it returns the number of collisions, and if it's not, it returns an error.
