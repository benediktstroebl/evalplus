```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars are collide and continue moving as if they did not.
    return the number of collisions.
```
This script defines a function called **car_race_collision** that simulates a head-to-head collision between two vehicles on an infinite road. The function uses the input **n**, which represents the number of vehicles involved in the collision, and returns the number of collisions that occur during the collision. 

The function simulates the collision of two vehicles moving in opposite directions, and the vehicles continue moving along their respective trajectories after the collision. The function is self-contained and does not require any external variables or functions to function.
