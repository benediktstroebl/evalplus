```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    # All cars are in the same speed; two cars will collide
    # when the car moving left to right hits the front of the car moving right to left
    # and they continue moving in their original direction
    # as if nothing happened.

    The function outputs the number of collisions that occurred.

```

This function simulates a car race collision scenario with two cars moving in opposite directions. It calculates the collisions based on the cars' movement and strength, and the function outputs the total count of collisions that took place.
