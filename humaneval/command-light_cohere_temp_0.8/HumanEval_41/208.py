```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed; two cars are moving toward each other.

    When a cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    This function outputs the particular number of collisions.
```

This function simulates the scenario of two sets of cars moving towards each other on a straight road. It calculates the collisions between the specific pairs of cars based on their direction of movement. The cars are considered to collide and then, continue moving along their respective trajectories. The function returns the number of collisions, which occurs when the cars move toward each other and collide.

You can use this function to solve the car race collision problem and pass any test for the number of collisions.

This code is self-contained and does not require any additional functions or variables from outside the function.
