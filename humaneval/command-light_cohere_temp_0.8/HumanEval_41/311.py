Here's the provided Python script:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed and direction; two cars are driving to collide
    and want to meet on the straight line.

    Once the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    Return the number of collisions.
 """ when two cars reach and meet.

return return n-sum(2*n - 1)
```
This Python code defines a function called `car_race_collision` that simulates a car race collision scenario. It creates the scenario of multiple cars moving along a straight line, with the option of them colliding with each other. The cars are represented as having infinite strength and move at the same speed. The function calculates the collision events and returns the total count of collisions between the cars, which is the sum of even numbers (2n-1) minus one to avoid double-counting collisions.
