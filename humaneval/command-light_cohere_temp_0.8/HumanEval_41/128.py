```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed.
    When two cars are heading toward each other and hit each other. As a result, they continue moving in their respective
    direction as if they did not collide. This function outputs the the number of collisions.
```
This function simulates a car race collision, where two sets of cars are driving towards each other. Each car will collide with the other and then keep moving along their path. The number of collisions is returned.

This function is self-contained and can be used to solve the car race collision problem and pass corresponding tests.
