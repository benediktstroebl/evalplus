```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    This the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return:
        i = 0
        for i in range(n):
            a = i
            b = n - i - 1
            if a > b:
                print(f'Collision! {')
                a -= 1
                b += 1
                # here, if the left-moving car moves 1 unit less than the right-moving car, they will collide
    return i
```
The function runs a loop that simulates the movement of n cars on the road, where each car is moving in the opposite direction to the other. The function then determines if the cars collide by comparing their positions and if they are moving in opposite directions. Once it detects a collision, it prints a message and updates the positions of the cars such that a collision occurred, which causes the cars to move in their original direction.
