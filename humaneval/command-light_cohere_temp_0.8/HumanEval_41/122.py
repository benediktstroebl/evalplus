```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    Two cars want to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    return: number of collisions
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            # car moving right to left hits another car
            if car_race_collision(n-1):
                return 1
        else:
            # car moving left to right hits nothing
            continue

```
The function checks if the number of cars on the road is greater than 0. If it is, it loops for every pair of cars on the road, and counts the number of collisions.
