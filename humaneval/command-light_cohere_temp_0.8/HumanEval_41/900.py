Here is a Python script that calculates the number of cars that will collide when a set of n cars are driving on a straight road:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. All cars move in the same speed.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return the number of cars that collide.
```
Here is a short piece of markdown to explain the code: 

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int): 
    # Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line. 
    # n cars driving left to right. simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    # All cars are same in the same speed, the two cars will collide
    # as they are moving towards each other. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, 
    # so they will continue moving along their original path after the collision. 
    # The output: the number of cars that collide
```
