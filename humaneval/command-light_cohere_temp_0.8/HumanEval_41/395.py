```python

    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and they are infinitely sturdy and strong.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    Returns the number of collisions.

    In this code, I've included a docstring description of the function that provides clarity and context to its purpose and behavior.

This code defines a function that simulates a car race collision scenario, where two sets of cars are driving in opposite directions and start from very far distances from each other. The function then determines the collisions and counts the number of collisions. 

The output of the function is the number of collisions that have occurred during the simulation. 

This is a great example of a self-contained Python script that demonstrates the solution to a problem using a descriptive and well-documented function.
