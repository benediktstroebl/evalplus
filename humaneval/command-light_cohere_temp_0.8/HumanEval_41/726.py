    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.

This code defines a function `car_race_collision` which simulates a traffic collision. It works by imagining a road as a straight line, with cars driving both left and right simultaneously. Then, the function determines when cars will collide, counting the number of collisions.

The test cases are also implemented in this code, passing the desired values of the input `n` and checking if the output of the `car_race_collision` function matches the expected output. 

The test cases cover various scenarios and ensure that the function's behavior correctly simulates traffic collisions.
