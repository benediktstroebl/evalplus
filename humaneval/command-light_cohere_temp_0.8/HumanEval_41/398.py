```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 
    Two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars that are moving towards each other collide
    and move on in their respective trajectories as if they didn't.
    The function outputs True if two cars collide, False otherwise.

# Example
test_collision(10)
```
This function is designed to simulate a car race collision scenario. It takes two sets of cars driving towards each other and checks for collisions. If two cars do collide, the function returns True, and if they do not collide, it returns False.
