Here's a self-contained Python script that defines and exercises the `car_race_collision` function:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed, and the collision is head-on.
    The two cars start out being very far from each other. 

    collision occurs when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    A collision happens when both cars continue moving and follow their original trajectories.

    Returns the number of collisions.
```
This function simulates a head-on collision between n cars driving on a straight road. It uses the concept of a collision being determined by the movement of the cars relative to each other. The cars are considered the same speed and continue moving along their respective paths after the collision. The function outputs the number of collisions that occur.
