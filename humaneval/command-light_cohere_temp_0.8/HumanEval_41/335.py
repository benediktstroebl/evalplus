```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and move at the same speed. 
    Two cars will collide when a car moving left to right hits a car moving right to left. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    The function returns the number of collisions.
```
Here's an example usage of the function:
```python
# Input value for n
n = int(input("Enter the number of cars: "))

# Call the car_race_collision function
result = car_race_collision(n)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

When you run the above code, it will prompt you to enter the number of cars and then it will call the car_race_collision function and print the number of collisions. The output will be the number of cars, and each car will collide with the corresponding partner as they meet.
