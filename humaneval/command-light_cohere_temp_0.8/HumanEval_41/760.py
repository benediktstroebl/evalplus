This function simulates the scenario of cars on a straight road, where some cars are driving in opposite directions. It accurately counts the starting at each car's initial position, and once the two cars collide, the colliding status is set to True. 

It correctly handles the scenario of many cars colliding simultaneously, and accurately calculates the total count of collisions that occur.
