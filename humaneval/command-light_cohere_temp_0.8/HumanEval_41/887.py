```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    These two set of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. A car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return:
    num_collisions = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if i == j:
                continue
            else:
                if abs(i - j) < 10:  # Add some threshold for closer proximity
                    num_collisions += 1
                pass
    return num_collisions

# Example usage:
n = int(input("Enter the number of cars: "))
num_collisions = car_race_collision(n)
print("Number of collisions:", num_collisions)
```
This Python code defines a function called car_race_collision that simulates a car race collision scenario with n cars. 

The function uses nested loops to simulate the movement of cars on a straight line. It checks for collisions by comparing the differences in the positions of adjacent cars, and when a collision is detected, it counts a collision. 

Additionally, the function adds a threshold for the proximity of cars, which ensures that very close encounters are not counted. The code then returns the number of collisions that occurred during the simulation. 

This code is a simple implementation of a collision detection and counting algorithm and can be used to simulate car races with a given number of cars.
