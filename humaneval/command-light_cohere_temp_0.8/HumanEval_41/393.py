```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars heading in opposite directions collide and continue moving in their respective trajectories. This function outputs the approach to the collision of two cars. The time is calculated in seconds.
