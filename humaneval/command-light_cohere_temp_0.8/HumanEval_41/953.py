```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed and have perfect
    acceleration/deceleration, so they would collide when they reach each other.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.
```

This function simulates a scenario where n cars are moving on a straight road. It uses the approach of having each car move until they collide with the other car or the edge of the road, and then it counts the number of collisions.
