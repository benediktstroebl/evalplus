```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    # The set of cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory
    as if they didn't collide.
    The function outputs the number of collisions.

car_race_collision = lambda n: n // 2 

# Test the function
test_car_race_collision(10)  # Should return 5, true
``` 
This function simulates the scenario of two sets of cars moving towards each other on a straight road. The cars are infinitely strong, so when they collide, they simply keep moving along their original paths. The function returns the number of collisions, which, in this case, is the number of cars that collide (half of the total number, since each set of cars collide with each other once).
