```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed, and two cars will collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return:
    return count( [x for x in [i for i in range(n)] for i in [0, n // 2]])

```

This function counts the number of collisions by using the xor operator ([ ]). The xor operator takes two iterables as arguments, and returns the number of elements that are present in either of the iterables but not in both. This will return True number of collisions in this scenario.
