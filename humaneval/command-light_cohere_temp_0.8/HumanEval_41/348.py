```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars will moving into each other when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    Returns the number of collisions.
```

The code defines a function `car_race_collision` that simulates a collision between two cars on a straight road. The function takes an parameter `n` which represents the number of cars in the race. The cars are driving in opposite directions on the road and are initially positioned far apart. When the cars move into each other, they collide and continue moving in their respective directions. The function outputs the number of collisions that occur in the race.
