```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed.
    Two cars want to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    return number of collisions.
    """ collision_s a
    simplest collision detection.
    """A first car is start at the origin. When a first car reaches the car2, it checks the distance between the two cars. 
    If collision happens if the car1 is moving left to right, and car2 is moving right to left. 
    car1 movement that car1 has a greater absolute value than car2. 
The first car stops, and the second car moves on in its trajectory.

This function outputs the number of collisions. You can also use this for any test cases and compare the output with your desired result.
