```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    These function outputs whether collision occurs between the cars and returns the number of collisions.
    """
The first n/2 cars start out at the same distance from each other,
    so they will collide if they are the same distance apart when the first car hits the second car.
