    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    # All cars move in the same speed; two cars will collide when moving into each other.
    # The scenario is modeled as a collision-free pair moving into each other.
    # The scenario is modeled as a pair of identical vehicles moving into each other
    # and so will not actually collide. 
    # However, the function can detect that this collision-free pair is 
    # moving into each other, and will return True as a result.
    # return a result of collision detection.
