Here's a self-contained Python function that simulates a head-to-head collision in a moving car:

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are moving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are
    driving right to left.
    All cars move in the same speed; two cars facing each other collide
    and push each other. The first car to push the other one starts moving in the opposite direction
    and thus completes the race.
    The function outputs the number of collisions

    # Define two lists of lists to represent vehicles and their initial positions
    vehicles = [[0, 0], [0, n - 1]]
    vehicles2 = [[0, n - 1], [0, 0]]

    # Iterate over the vehicles list
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            # Calculate the distance between the two vehicles
            distance = (abs(vehicles[i][0] - vehicles2[j][0]) + abs(vehicles[i][1] - vehicles2[j][1]))**0.5

            smallest distance.
