```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left.
    The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    return number of collisions.
```
This script defines a function `car_race_collision` which takes an integer `n` as input and performs a car racing collision simulation. The function creates two lists, `cars_driving_right` and `cars_driving_left`, each containing `n` elements. These lists represent the
 cars moving right and left respectively. 

The `cars_driving_right` list is populated with the numbers of cars driving right, and the `cars_driving_left` list is populated with the numbers of cars driving left. 

The function then calls the `random.shuffle()` method on both of these lists to shuffle the order of cars. 

The `cars_driving_right` and `cars_driving_left` lists are now interchanged. 

Then, the function loops through both lists and checks if the current car is driving left or right. If it is, it moves to the next car in the corresponding list. 

The function also checks if the current car collides with the car that is moving in the opposite direction. 

Finally, the function returns the number of collisions that occurred.
