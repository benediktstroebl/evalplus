```

This test function checks whether a collision occurs in the given time frame using the car_race_collision function. It returns True if the time is greater than the time it takes to travel that distance, which is represented as the number of seconds.

You can now use this test_collision function to check if the car_race_collision function works correctly for a given number of cars.

This Python script is a self-contained solution to the problem of finding the number of collisions in a car race. It provides a test logic and a test function to check the correctness of the function.
