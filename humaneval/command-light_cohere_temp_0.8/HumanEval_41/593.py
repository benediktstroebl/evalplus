Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the car race collision problem in a markdown code block:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars that are heading towards each other collide and continue moving in their respective directions as if they did not collide.

    return: return True  if all collisions occurred; otherwise, return False.
    """
```

# Driver's input
n = int(input())  # taking input from the user

# Check if n is valid
if n < 1:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a minimum number of cars (n >= 1)")
    return

# Initialize all cars as not colliding
collision_status = [False] * [list]

# Create a queue of cars
queue = []
queue.add([n, 0, False)

# Process all cars in the queue
while queue:
    current = queue.pop(0)
    # current is the index of the car, the value is its position on the road
    next = current + 1
    # check if the next car is too close to the current car
    if (next < n and not collision_status[next]):
        # if it's safe, add the next car to the collision_status list
        collision_status[next] = True
        # make the next car as the current car and update its status
        queue.append(next, 0, collision_status[next])
    else:
        # if it's not safe, skip this car
        continue

# Check if there was a collision
if not collision_status[0]:
    print("No collision occurred.")
return
```
This code defines a function called `car_race_collision` that simulates the scenario of two cars moving towards each other on a straight road. The function uses a `queue` to keep track of the cars and their respective positions. The cars are driven towards each other, and the function checks for collisions between them. If a cars collide, the status of the colliding cars is updated, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, if no collision occurred, the function returns `False`.
