    # Define two lists to keep track of cars.
    left_cars = [0, 0]
    right_cars = [0] * n

    # If there was no collision, both cars would have reached each other.  Now if this function is returning True. 
    return collision

You can test the function by passing different values for n and verifying that it returns the correct results.
