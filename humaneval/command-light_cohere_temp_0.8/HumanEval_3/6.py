Here's the solution to the markdown code block you provided:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations):
    """
    Determine if the account balance ever falls below zero.
    :type operations: List[int]
    :return: bool
    """
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
    return balance < 0
```

The above Python script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations and checks if the final balance falls below zero. It iterates using loop through the balance and each operation, finally returning a boolean value.
