Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
    return balance < 0
```

This function takes a list of deposit and withdrawal operations for a bank account and determines if at any point, the balance falls below zero. It uses a provided as an parameter the operations list and initializes a balance variable to 0. Then, it iterates through each operation in the list, adding the value of the operation to the balance. Finally, it returns True if the balance is less than 0, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at some point during the operations.
