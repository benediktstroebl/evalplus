Here is a Python script that includes a self-contained function `below_zero` that solves the problem you provided:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of the account fall below zero, and at that point, function should return True. Otherwise, it should return False."""
    # Sorting the operations to ensure the function works correctly
    operations.sort()
    number of operations in descending order.
    current_balance = 0
    for i, operation in enumerate(operations):
        if operation == 0:  # Deposit operation
            current_balance += operation
        elif operation < 0:  # Withdrawal operation
            current_balance -= operation
        elif current_balance < 0:
            return True
        else:
            continue
    return False
```
This function takes a list of operations as input and returns a boolean value. It uses a basic sorting to ensure that operations are processed correctly and checks if the balance ever falls below zero.
