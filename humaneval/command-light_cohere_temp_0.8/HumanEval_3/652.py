```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance -= op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of integers `operations` as input and returns a boolean value `True` if the balance of the account ever falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function initializes the blance to 0 and then iterates through the operations. It decreases each operation from the value and checks if the balance becomes negative. If so happens, the balance does go below 0, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
