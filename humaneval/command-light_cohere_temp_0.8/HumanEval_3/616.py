Here's the Python script:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```

This function is designed to check if the account balance falls below zero at any point during the execution of the list of operations. It uses a balance variable to keep track of the current balance and iterates over the operations, checking if the balance becomes negative. If the balance ever becomes negative, the function will return True, indicating that the balance has indeed fallen below zero. Otherwise, it will return False, indicating that the balance remained non-negative throughout the operations.
