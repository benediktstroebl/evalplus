```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of the account falls below zero, and at that point, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False."""
    balance = 0

``` 
This script defines a function called below_zero, which takes a list of operations as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance of the account falls below zero. The function uses a balance variable to keep track of the account balance, and it iterates through each operation in the list. The function first subtracts the withdrawal operations from the balance and checks if the new balance is less than zero. If it is, the function immediately returns True. If the balance remains non-negative after all operations, the function returns False, indicating that the balance is not below zero.
