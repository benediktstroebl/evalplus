```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```
This code defines a function below_zero that checks whether a list of operations will cause the balance of a bank account to go below zero. It initializes a specific balance of 0, and for each operation in the operations list, it checks whether the balance will become negative, and if it is, it returns True. If the balance doesn't become negative after processing all the operations, it returns False, indicating that the account balance will remain positive.
