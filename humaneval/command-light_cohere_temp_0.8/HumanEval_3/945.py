Here is the self-contained Python script that defines a function below_zero that solves the problem you provided:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation > 0:
            balance += operation
        elif operation < 0:
            balance -= operation
    return balance < 0
```
This above function takes a list of operations, and at each point of the loop, it increments or decrements the balance based on the operation. This will help whether the multiple operations are such that will eventually result in the balance falling below zero, and the function will return True, else False.

Remember to use this function by passing the operations list, and then you will be able to easily check the return value to determine if the balance is below zero.
