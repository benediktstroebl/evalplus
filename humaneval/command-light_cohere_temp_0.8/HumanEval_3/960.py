Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False

# Example usage
# This will return True, since all operations will cause the balance to go below zero
below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
``` 
This function takes a list of integers as input and iterates through the list, adding each operation to the balance. If at any point the time the balance goes below zero, the function returns True. If the balance doesn't go below zero, the function returns False.
