```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation > 0:  # deposit operation
            balance += operation
        elif operation < 0:  # withdrawal operation
            if balance < 0:
                return True
            balance -= operation
    return balance >= 0


# Test cases:
# Test the function with a series of deposits and withdrawals.
operations = [1, 2, -4, 5]
result = below_zero(operations)
print(result)  

# Test the function with a list of operations where one of them will make the balance go below zero.
operations = [-1, -2, 3, 4]
result = below_zero(operations)
print(result) 
``` 
This Python script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations and determines if the balance of the account ever falls below zero. The function uses a balance variable to keep track of the current balance.
