```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
    return balance < 0
``` 
This Python code defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers `operations` as an argument. 

The function initializes a balance variable to zero. The loop iterates through each operation in the list, adding it to the balance. 

After each iteration, the function returns the current balance and checks if it is less than zero. If the balance is indeed less than zero, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
