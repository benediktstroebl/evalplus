Here's the provided Python code that solves the problem of checking if the account balance falls below zero in a markdown code block:
```python
def below_zero(operations):
    """
    You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fall is below zero, and
    at that point function should return True. Otherwise, it should return False.
    """

>
    :param operations: List[int]: operations to be performed on the account.
    :return: bool: True if balance falls below zero and False otherwise
    """
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance += operation
    return False
```
This code provides a self-contained function that checks if the balance of the account falls below zero, and returns the result accordingly.
