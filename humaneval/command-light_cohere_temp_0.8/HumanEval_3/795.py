Here's a Python script that includes a self-contained function `below_zero` that solves the problem you've described: 

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    # Function to check if the balance of the account ever falls below zero
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance += op
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance ever falls below zero. 

The function initializes a balance to 0, and then iterates through each operation in the input list. It adds each operation to the balance and checks if the balance becomes negative, at which point it returns `True`.
