Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem of checking if the balance of a bank account falls below zero:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```
The script provides a function below_zero that takes a list of operations and returns a boolean value indicating if the balance of the account ever fell below zero. 
This solution is self-contained, does not rely on external variables or functions, and passes the test of being a complete solution.
