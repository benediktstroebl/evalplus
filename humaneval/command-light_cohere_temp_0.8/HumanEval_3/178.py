Here's a Python script that implements the `below_zero` function from the prompt:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance = balance + operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This code defines a function `below_zero` that checks a list of operations against a starting balance. It uses a the method of keeping track of the balance and then at any point, if the balance falls below zero, it will return True. If balance is already zero, and all operations are either positive or zero, it will return False after the loop completes.
