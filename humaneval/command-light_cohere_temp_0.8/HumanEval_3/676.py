Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
    if balance < 0:
        return True
    return False
```
This function takes a list of operations (deposit and withdrawal numbers) and detects if at any point, the balance of the account falls below zero. 
The function first initializes a balance variable to 0 and then iterates through each operation in the list. When an operation is executed, the balance is incremented. If at any point, the balance becomes negative (falling below zero), the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
