Here's the self-contained Python function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This function takes a list of operations and iterates over them, checking if the balance falls below zero at any point. If it finds such value that makes the balance go negative, the function returns True, otherwise, it returns False.

This function is self-contained and doesn't rely on any external Python libraries or modules. It's a pure Python function that is easy to understand, maintain, and test. with the organization of the code block in a single file, and you can easily integrate it into your own project. 

I hope this helps you achieve your task!
