Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```
The script defines a function called below_zero that takes a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance of the account falls below zero. It uses a initializes the balance to 0, and then iterates over each operation in the list. If the balance falls below zero, the function returns True, otherwise, it returns False.
