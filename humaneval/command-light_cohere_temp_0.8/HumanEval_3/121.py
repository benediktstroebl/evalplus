Here is the Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:

```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
    return balance < 0
```

This code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of integers as an argument, and returns a boolean value that indicates whether the balance of the account falls below zero after applying all the operations. The function initializes a balance with 0 and then iterates over each operation in the list, adding it to the balance. The function will return True if the balance becomes negative, indicating that the account balance has fallen below zero.

This function is self-contained, and it can be used to solve the problem and pass corresponding tests.
