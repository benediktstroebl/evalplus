```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= operation
    return False
```
This function, below_zero, takes a list of integers as input, representing deposit and withdrawal operations. It initializes a balance to 0, then iterates through the list of operations, for each operation, it checks if the balance falls below 0. If it is, the function returns True. If the balance remains positive or important, the function returns False, indicating that the balance never fell below zero.
