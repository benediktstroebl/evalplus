Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you provided:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This function takes a list of deposit and withdrawal operations as input and uses a loop to iterate through the operations. It starts with an initial balance of 0 and adds each operation to the balance. If at any point the the balance becomes negative, the function immediately returns True. Otherwise, it continues to iterate through the operations and returns False when the balance reaches zero.
