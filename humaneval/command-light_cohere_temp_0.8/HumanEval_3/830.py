```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```
Here is a Python function below_zero, which takes a list of operations and checks if any operation in that list causes the balance to go below zero. 

The function initializes a balance variable to 0. 
Then, it iterates over each operation and checks if the balance goes below zero. If the balance falls below zero, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False. 
This function is self-contained and solves the problem of checking if the balance of the account falls below zero.
