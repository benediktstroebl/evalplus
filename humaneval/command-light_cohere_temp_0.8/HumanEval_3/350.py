Here's the self-contained Python function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance -= op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This function takes a list of operations and iterates through them, continuously subtracting the operations from the balance. The function returns True if at any point the balance falls below zero, and False otherwise.

This function effectively solves the problem of checking for operations that would cause the balance to go below zero, and returns the result accordingly.
