Here's the Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of integers as an argument. The function iterates through the input operations and checks if the balance of the account ever falls below zero. If it does, the function returns `True`, indicating that the account balance went below zero at least. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This code is self-contained and can be easily incorporated into other scripts as needed.
