```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance = balance + operation
    if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
``` 
This script provides a self-contained function below_zero that solves the problem you've described. It takes a goal of the function is to detect if the account balance ever falls below zero and returns True, otherwise it returns False. The function uses a balance variable to keep track of the current balance and loops through the operations in the operations list, adding each operation to the balance.

It first initializes balance to 0, and then iterates through each operation in the operations list, adding the operation to the balance. The function returns True if the balance falls below zero during the iteration. If the balance doesn't fall below zero, the function returns False, indicating that the balance never fell below zero.
