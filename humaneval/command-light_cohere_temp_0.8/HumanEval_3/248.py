Here is the Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
    return balance < 0
```
The function `below_zero` takes a list of operations `operations` and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance falls below zero at any point during the operations.
