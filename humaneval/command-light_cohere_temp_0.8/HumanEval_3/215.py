```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance -= op
    return balance < 0
``` 
This code implements the following problem in the function below_zero:
It takes a list of operations as input, where each operation is a deposit or withdrawal from the account balance. The function iterates over each operations and updates the balance accordingly. After processing all operations, it checks if the balance is less than zero, and if so, it returns True, indicating that the balance fell below zero. Otherwise, it returns False, indicating that the balance did not fall below zero.
