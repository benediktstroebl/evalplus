Here's the Python code:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of the account falls below zero, and at that point, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
    
    >>> operations = [1, 2, -4, 5]
    return balance < 0
``` 
The above code has a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests.
