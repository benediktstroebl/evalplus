Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance = balance + operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
The function below_zero takes a list of operations as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance of the account ever falls below zero. The function iterates through the empty balance, and for each operation, the balance is incremented. If at any point the time the balance becomes negative, the function immediately returns True, indicating that the balance has fallen below zero at least. If the loop completes without finding a negative balance, the function returns False, indicating that the balance has never been below zero.
