Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of the account falls below zero, and
    at that point function should return True. Otherwise, it should return False.
    >>> operations = [1, 2, -4, 5]
    """
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
The provided Python function, below_zero, is designed to determine whether the balance of a bank account falls below zero after considering a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. It does so by iteratively processing the operations, maintaining a running total of the balance, and ultimately comparing the total balance to zero. The function ultimately returns True if the balance becomes negative, indicating a negative balance, and False otherwise.
