Here's a self-contained Python script that defines a function `below_zero` that solves the problem you've outlined: 

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```

This script provides a solution to the problem, and the `below_zero` function takes a list of operations as input and returns `True` if any operation in the list would cause the balance to be less than zero, and returns `False` otherwise. 

It uses a loop to iterate through the operations and checks if the balance falls below zero. The loop then adds the balance by the value of the operation.
