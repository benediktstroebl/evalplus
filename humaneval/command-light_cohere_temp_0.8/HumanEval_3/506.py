```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance -= op
    return balance < 0
``` 
This script defines a function called below_zero, which takes a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance of the account falls below zero. 

The function initializes a balance variable to 0 and then iterates through each operation in the input list. 

During each iteration, the function subtracts the value of the operation from the balance variable. 

Finally, the function returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance is less than 0, which is equivalent to checking if the balance is negative.
