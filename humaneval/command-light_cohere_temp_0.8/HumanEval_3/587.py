```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
``` 
This function takes a list of operations, iterates over the list, and at each iteration, adds the operation to the balance. When the balance falls below 0, it returns True, otherwise, False. it a simple and efficient solution.

The above solution is quite clear, and easy to understand. It is self-contained, and follows the problem statement correctly. The function starts with an initial balance of 0, and at each iteration, adds the operation to the balance and checks if the balance falls below 0. If the balance falls below 0, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
