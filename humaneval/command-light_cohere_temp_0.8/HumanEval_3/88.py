Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """ You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fall below zero, and
    at that point function should return True. Otherwise, it should return False.
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
    False
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
    True
    >>> below_zero([0, -3, 2])
    False
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    True
    >>> below_zero([1,2, 3, -1])
    False
    """
    # Loop through the operations
    for i in operations:
        # Check if the balance goes below zero
        if i < 0:
            return True
    
    # If balance is not below zero, return False
    return False
```
The provided Python script showcases a function named `below_zero` that assesses whether a bank account's balance falls below zero, triggering a return value of `True`. The function accepts a single parameter, `operations`, which represents a list of operations encompassing deposits and withdrawals. The function implements this loop to evaluate each operation, and if any operation is negative, it signifies a withdrawal from the account that would reduce the balance below zero. If, in fact, all operations are positive, yielding a deposit or no change, the function returns `False`. This illustrates how the function effectively identifies and responds to scenarios where the balance might fall below zero.
