```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance = balance + operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
``` 
This above Python script provides a self-contained solution to the problem and passes all the corresponding tests.
