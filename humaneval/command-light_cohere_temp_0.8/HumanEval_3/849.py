Here's a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you provided: 
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """ 
    Check if any operation in operations will make the balance 
    go below zero.
    """
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance -= operation
        if balance < 0: 
            return True
    return False
``` 
This script defines a function `below_zero` that checks if the operations in an input list `operations` will cause the account balance to go below zero. 
It iterates through each operation in `operations` and checks if the current balance will become negative, if so, it returns `True`. If the loop completes without finding a negative balance, it returns `False`.
