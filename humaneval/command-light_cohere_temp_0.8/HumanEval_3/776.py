Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= operation
    return False
```
This script defines a function below_zero that takes a list of operations as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance of the account goes below zero. The function initializes a balance to zero and then iterates over the list of operations. It checks if the balance becomes negative, returns True. If the balance remains non-negative after processing all operations, the function returns False.

This script can be used as a standalone solution to the problem described in the prompt. It provides a quick and simple implementation of the algorithm without the need for external functions or libraries.
