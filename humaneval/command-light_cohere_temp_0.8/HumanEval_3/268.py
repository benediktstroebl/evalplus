Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```
This script defines a function below_zero that takes a list of integers representing deposit and withdrawal operations as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance of the account has fallen below zero. The script initializes the balance to 0 and iterates over each operation in the list. When it finds that the balance has fallen below zero, the function immediately returns True. Otherwise, it continues iterating through the operation and adds the amount to the balance. Finally, it returns False, indicating that the balance is still non-negative.
