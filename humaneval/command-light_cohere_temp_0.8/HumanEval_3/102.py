```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
``` 
This Python script contains a self-contained function called below_zero that detects whether the balance of a bank account starts with zero and falls below zero at any point in the operations provided. The function uses a unbalanced loop that goes through each operation and calculates the balance after each operation. It checks whether the numbers result in a negative sum and returns True if so. It then returns False if the account balance stays non-negative after all operations.
