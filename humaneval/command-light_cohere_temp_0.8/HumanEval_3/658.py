```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
``` 
This Python function below_zero takes a list of integers representing deposit and withdrawal operations as input, and it aims to detect if at any point the balance of the account falls below zero. The function initializes a balance to zero and then iterates through each operation in the list. If the balance becomes negative, it returns True, indicating the condition is met, otherwise, it continues to perform the deposit and withdrawal operations and returns False.
