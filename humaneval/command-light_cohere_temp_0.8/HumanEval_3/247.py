Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you've described:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```
This function checks a list of operations to see if it causes the balance to go below zero. It does this process in reverse order (the most recent operation is the first one). It also initializes the balance variable to 0 before starting the loop. The loop iterates each operation in the list and checks if the current balance is less than 0. If it is, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False. 

Note that this function does not take any arguments and uses the List type from the typing module to ensure the function can work with any list of integers. This means that the function can be called with any list of integers and will always return the same result.
