Here is a Python script that includes a self-contained function that solves the problem of checking if any operation on an account balance causes it to fall below zero:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """ You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fall below zero, and
    at that point function should return True. Otherwise, it should return False.
    >>> operations = [1, 2, -4, 5]
    return operations.islice(0, -1).
```

Let's break down the code step by step:

1. Function `below_zero` is defined, which takes a list of integers `operations` as an argument.
2. Inside the function, we define a helper function `islice` from the `typing` module. This function is takes a slice of `operations` from the index `0` to the index `-1`, effectively selecting the last element.
3. This function then use the he list comprehension to check if the selected `operations` element causes the balance to go below zero.
4 Finally the function return `True` if the condition is met (i.e., the element selected makes the balance go below zero), and `False` otherwise.

The code is self-contained, meaning it does not rely on any external modules or functions. It uses the list comprehension and the `typing` module to efficiently solve the problem of checking for negative balance in a bank account.
