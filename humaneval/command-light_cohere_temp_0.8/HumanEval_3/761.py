```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
    if balance < 0:
        return True
    return False
``` 
This code defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers as an argument. The function performs a `deposit and withdrawal operations on a simulated bank account balance`, starting from an initial balance of 0. The function iterates through each operation in the list, and adds the value of the operation to the current balance. If the balance falls below 0 at any point, the function returns `True`, indicating that the balance is below zero. Otherwise, the function returns `False`, indicating that the balance is not below zero.
