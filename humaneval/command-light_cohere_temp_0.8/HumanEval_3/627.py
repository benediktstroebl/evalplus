```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```
Here's a Python script that defines a function `below_zero` that checks whether the given operations will result in a balance below zero. 
The function initializes a balance variable to 0 and iterates over the list of operations. 
During the iteration, it checks whether the balance is less than zero, and if it is, the function returns `True`. If the balance becomes non-negative after the operation, the function returns `False`.
