Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you've described:
```Python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance += operation
    return False
```
You can use this below_zero function in a markdown code block to test its functionality and it will return 'True' if the balance ever falls below zero, and 'False' otherwise.
