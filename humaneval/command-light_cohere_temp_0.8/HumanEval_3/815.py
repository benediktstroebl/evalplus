```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
We've encapsulated the logic to check if the balance of the account ever falls below zero within the `below_zero` function. This function takes a balance as an starting point, and then iterates through the list of operations, adding each operation to the balance. Once we've traversed the he operations, we check if the balance has gone below zero, and if so, we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.
