Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This function takes a list of deposit and withdrawal operations for a bank account as input, and it starts with an initial balance of 0. It iterates through operations, accumulating their effects on the balance. If at any point, the balance falls below zero, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. 

Remember to ensure the function signature and input/output descriptions are accurate and clear.
