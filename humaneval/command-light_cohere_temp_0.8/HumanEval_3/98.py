```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
``` 
This above-mentioned Python code defines a function called below_zero that takes a list of operations as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance of the account falls below zero after processing all the operations. 

This function operates by initializing a balance variable to 0 and then iteratively processing each operation in the operations list. 
If at any point the balance of the account becomes negative, the function immediately returns True. Otherwise, it updates the balance with the value of the operation and returns False.
