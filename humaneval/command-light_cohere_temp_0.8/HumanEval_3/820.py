Here's the updated code:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```
This code defines a function below_zero that takes a list of operations and checks if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point in the list. The balance is initialized with 0, and the loop iterates over each operation. If the balance becomes negative, the function returns True, indicating that the account balance has fallen below zero. If the loop completes without any negative balance, the function returns False.
