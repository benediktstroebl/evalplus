Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
    return balance < 0
```
This code defines a function below_zero that takes a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value that indicates if the balance of the account falls below zero. The function initializes a balance to 0 and then iterates over the list of operations, adding each operation to the balance. When the balance becomes negative, the function returns True, indicating that the balance has fallen below zero. If the balance remains non-negative, the function returns False.
