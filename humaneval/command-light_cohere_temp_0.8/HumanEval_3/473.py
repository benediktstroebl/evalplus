```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """ 
    Determine if the account balance ever falls below zero given a list of operations. 
    Asserts operations as a list of positive and negative integers.
    >>> operations = [1, 2, -4, 5]
    >>> below_zero(operations)
    True
    """
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
    if balance < 0:
        return True
    return False
``` 
This approach uses a loop to add each operation to the balance, and returns True if the balance ever falls below zero, False otherwise. The function uses the balance to start with 0 and adds each operation.
