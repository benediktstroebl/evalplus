```  This Python code is a function called below_zero, designed to check if a given list of operations on a bank account will lead to a negative balance. The function takes a list of integers as input, representing operations involving deposits and withdrawals from the account. It iterates through the of operations and checks if any of them is negative, and if so, it returns True, indicating that the balance will fall below zero. Otherwise, it returns False.
