Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function below_zero that checks if any operation in a list of operations reduces the balance below zero.

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance -= op
    return balance < 0

# Test cases
 >>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([4, 5, -4, -3])
True
``` 
This script defines a function below_zero that takes a list of operations as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance fell below zero during the operations. The function iterates through each operation in the list and updates the balance accordingly. The final balance is then compared to zero, and if it is less than zero, the function returns True, indicating that the balance fell below zero. If the balance is not less than zero, the function returns False, indicating that the balance did not fall below zero.
