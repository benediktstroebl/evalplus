Here's the self-contained Python script that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= operation
    return False
```
The function checks if the account balance goes below zero during the execution of the operations provided. If this is the happens, the function returns True, indicating that the account balance has fallen below zero. If the balance is maintained or the operations don't result in a negative balance, the function will return False.
