Here's the complete Python script with a self-contained function `below_zero()`:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
    return balance < 0
```
The `below_zero` function takes a list of integers as input, representing deposit and withdrawal operations. It initializes a balance to 0, then iterates through each operation, adding its value to the balance. After iterating through operations, it checks if the balance is less than 0 and returns `True` if it is. Otherwise, it returns `False`.  The test cases are provided to verify the functionality of the function.
