Here's the corrected self-contained Python function that solves the problem you provided: 

```python
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= operation
    return False
```

This function takes a list of operations as an argument, where each operation is either a deposit or a withdrawal. It initializes the regular expression and loops over the operations, checking if the balance falls below zero. If it does, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
