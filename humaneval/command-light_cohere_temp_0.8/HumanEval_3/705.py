```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """ Checks if the account balance falls below zero.
    for x in operations:
        if x < 0:
            return True
    return False
``` 
This function, below_zero, takes a list of operations, tests each operation against the current balance, and returns True if any operation is negative, indicating that the balance is below zero. 

The function uses a loop to iterate over each operation in the list, and for each operation, it checks if the operation is negative. If the operation is negative, it returns True, indicating that the balance has fallen below zero. 

The function is well-contained and does not require any external functions or classes. It is self-contained and can be easily reused in other parts of code.
