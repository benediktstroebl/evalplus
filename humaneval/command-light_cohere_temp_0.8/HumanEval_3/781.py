Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem you have provided:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False

# Unit tests
tests = [
    [
        below_zero=[1, 2, -4, 5],
        below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5, 6]),
        below_zero([1, -4, 5, -6]),
        below_zero([100, -100, -2, -1])
    ]

for test_case in tests:
    print(test_case)
``` 
This script defines a function called below_zero, which takes a list of operations as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance of the account falls below zero. The function iterates through each operation in the list, and if the balance becomes negative, the function returns True. If the balance remains non-negative after processing all operations, the function returns False.

Finally, the script provides a set of unit tests that cover different scenarios, such as multiple operations, operations with equal magnitude, and operations with the same value but different signs. The script then iterates through each test case and prints the result, which helps to validate the correctness of the below_zero function.
