Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of the account falls below zero, and
    at that point function should return True. Otherwise, it should return False.
    
    Operations are list should be positive integers. If any operation results in a negative, it will be treated as a withdrawal.
    """
    return sum(operations) < 0
```
This function takes a list of operations and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance of the account falls below zero at any point in the operations. It is tested to be a withdrawal operation, and it treats negative numbers as withdrawals. 

Note: If the function is used with test cases, please add appropriate test cases to cover all edge cases and ensure the function behaves as expected.
