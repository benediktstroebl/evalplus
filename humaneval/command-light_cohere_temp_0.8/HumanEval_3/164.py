```Python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation > 0:
            balance += operation
        elif operation < 0:
            return True
    return False
``` 
This Python function, below_zero, takes a list of operations as input. It initializes a scenario with a balance of zero and then iterates through each operation in the list. If an operation is positive, it will increase the balance, and if the operation is negative, the function will detect a negative balance and return True.
