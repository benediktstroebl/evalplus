Here is a Python script that includes a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
    return balance < 0
```

This script defines a function below_zero that takes a list of operations (deposit and withdrawal) as an input and returns a boolean value. The function initializes a balance to zero and then iterates over each operation in the input list, adding the operation to the balance. The function returns True if the balance becomes negative, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at any point.
