    for op in operations:
        if op < 0:

```
This Python code defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers as an argument. It then iterates through the pointed by `operations` and checks if any of the operations is negative. The code accumulates the negative balance, if the current operation is less than zero, otherwise it breaks out of the loop and moves to the next operation.
