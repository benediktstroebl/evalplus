Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```
This code defines a function below_zero that takes a list of operations as input and determines if any operation will cause the balance of the account to be less than zero. 

To test the function, you can call it with a sample list of operations and verify the returned result.
