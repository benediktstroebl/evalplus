Here's the provided Python code with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
    return balance < 0
```
The `below_zero` function takes a list of integers `operations` as an argument. It initializes a the balance with 0, and then iterates through each operation in the list. If the balance exceeds 0, the function returns True, indicating that the balance fell below zero. Otherwise, it returns False.

The `balance` variable is used to keep track of the current balance. The function adds each operation to the balance, and checks if the balance is less than 0 at the end.
