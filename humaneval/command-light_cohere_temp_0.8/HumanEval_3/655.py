Here's the self-contained Python script that solves the problem you provided, which is to check if the balance of a given account ever falls below zero:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance += operation
    return False
```
This function iterates over each number in the list of operations, and for each number, it checks if the balance ever becomes negative and returns True. If the balance remains non-negative throughout the operation, the function will return False after processing all operations.
