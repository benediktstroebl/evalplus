```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
``` 
This Python script defines a function called `below_zero` that checks whether the balance of a bank account falls below zero after processing a list of operations. The function initializes a balance to 0 and then iterates through each operation in the operations list, checking if the balance falls below zero. If it does, the balance does go negative, the function returns True, indicating that the account balance has fallen below zero. If the balance remains non-negative after processing all operations, the function returns False.
