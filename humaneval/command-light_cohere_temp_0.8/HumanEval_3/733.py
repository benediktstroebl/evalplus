```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
    if balance < 0:
        return True
    return False
```

The function takes a list of operations as input and iterates through each operation, adding its value to the balance. The function returns True if at any point the balance becomes negative, indicating that the account balance has fallen below zero. Otherwise, it returns False. 

The provided code effectively solves the problem by checking if the balance ever becomes negative, and passes the test.
