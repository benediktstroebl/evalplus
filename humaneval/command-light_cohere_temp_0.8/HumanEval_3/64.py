```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation < 0:
            balance -= operation
        else:
            break
    return balance < 0
```
This Python script defines a function called below_zero that checks if the balance of a bank account falls below zero after processing a list of operations. It uses a Python's built-in 'typing' module to define a function that takes a list of operations (deposit and withdrawals) as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance is below zero. 

Overall, this function is designed to perform a sequence of operations on a balance value and determine whether the balance has fallen below zero, which is the problem's specific implementation.
