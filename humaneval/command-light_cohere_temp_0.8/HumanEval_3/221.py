Here is a Python script that includes a self-contained function to solve the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```
This function below_zero takes a list of operations and iteratively processes them, checking if the balance ever falls below zero. It returns True if any time the balance becomes negative and False otherwise.
