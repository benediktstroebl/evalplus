Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function below_zero that solves the problem you provided:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation > 0:  # deposit, add to balance
            balance += operation
        elif operation < 0:  # withdrawal, subtract from balance
            balance -= operation
    return balance < 0
```
The function takes a list of operations as an input, and iterates through the operations. It maintains a balance by adding deposits and subtracting withdrawals. If at any point the Local balance becomes negative, the function returns True, indicating that the account balance has fallen below zero. Otherwise, it returns False.
