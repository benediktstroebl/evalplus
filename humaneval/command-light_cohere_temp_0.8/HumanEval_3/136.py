```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance -= op
    return balance < 0
``` 
This Python function below_zero takes a list of integers as input, representing deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. The function aims to determine if at any point the balance of the account falls below zero, and returns True in such case, indicating that the account has negative balance. Otherwise, it returns False, indicating that the balance remains positive throughout the sequence of operations. 

The function initializes a balance variable to 0 and then iterates through each operation in the input list. It subtracts each operation from the balance variable, effectively simulating the impact of each operation on the account balance. 
During the iteration, if the balance becomes negative, the function returns True, indicating that the account has negative balance at some point. Otherwise, it continues iterating through the next operation and the balance remains non-negative.
