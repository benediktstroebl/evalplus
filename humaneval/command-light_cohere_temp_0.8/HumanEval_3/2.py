Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of checking if any deposit or withdrawal operation results in a balance below zero:
```python
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
    return balance < 0
```
The function takes a list of operations as input and iterates through each operation, adding its value to the balance. This accumulation of operations is stored in the balance variable. It returns True if the time, it reaches a point where the balance is less than zero, indicating that the account balance fell below zero at some point.
