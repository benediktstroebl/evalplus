Here is a Python script that includes a self-contained function `below_zero` that solves the problem you have provided:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """ You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fall is below zero, and
    at that point function should return True. Otherwise, it should return False.
    >>> operations
   
    balanced with zero and no negative operations, the account balance will
    never go below zero.
    >>> operations = [1, 2, -4, 5]
    False
    >>> operations = [-1, -100, -10, 5]
    True
    """

# Returns True if the operations can result in balance below zero, False otherwise
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    operations = [abs(op) for op in operations]
    return any(x < 0 for x in operations)
```
