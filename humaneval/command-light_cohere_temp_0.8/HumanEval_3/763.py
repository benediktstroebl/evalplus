Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
    return balance < 0
```
This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of integers as input, representing deposit and withdrawal operations for a bank account. It initializes the unique variable `balance` to 0. Then, for each operation in `operations` list, it increments the balance.  If end of operations is reached, the function checks if the balance is below 0. 
If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This function is self-contained and fully solves the problem of checking if the balance of a bank account falls below zero after a series of operations.
