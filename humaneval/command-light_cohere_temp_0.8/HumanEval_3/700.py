Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem you provided:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```

The code you provided defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of operations as an argument. The function initializes a balance to zero and iterates over the list of operations. It checks if the operation will a deposit and causes the balance to be less than zero, which triggers the function to return `True`. If the loop completes without any negative balance, the function will return `False`.
