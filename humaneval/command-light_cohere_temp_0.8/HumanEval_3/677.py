Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance = balance + operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
The function takes a list of operations as input and uses a loop to iterate through each operation. The function then adds the balance variable and checks if the balance falls below zero. If it does, the function returns True, indicating that the balance is below zero. If the balance remains positive, the function returns False.
