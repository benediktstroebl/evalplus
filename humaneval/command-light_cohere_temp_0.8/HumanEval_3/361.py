```Python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance += operation
    return False
``` 
This Python code defines a function called below_zero that takes a list of integers as an argument, representing deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. The function uses a balance variable to keep track of the account balance, starting with an initial balance of 0. The function then iterates through each operation in the list, checking if the balance falls below 0. If it finds a in the loop, it returns True to indicate that the account balance has indeed gone below zero. Otherwise, it continues iterating through the next operation, adding the operation to the balance. The function eventually returns False, which means that no operations caused the account balance to fall below zero.
