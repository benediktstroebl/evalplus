Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you've outlined and provides test cases to verify its functionality:

```python
def below_zero(operations):
    """
    Checks if the balance ever falls below zero in the sequence of operations.
    Parameters: List of integers, where each integer is a number
    representing a deposit or withdrawal operation
    """
    operations = [x for x in operations if x != 0]  
    
    # Check if the operations list has at least one non-zero value
    if not operations:
        return False
    
    # Initialize a flag to track balance below zero
    balance_below_zero = True
    
    # Iterate through each operation
    for operation in operations:
        # If the balance is already below zero, set the flag to True
        if balance_below_zero and operation < 0:
            balance_below_zero = True
        # If the balance becomes non-negative after an operation, set the flag to False
        elif balance_below_zero and operation > 0:
            balance_below_zero = False
    
    return balance_below_zero

# Test cases
# Test case 1
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Output: True

# Test case 2
print(below_zero([5, -3, -4]))  # Output: True

# Test case 3
print(below_zero([1, -2, 3, -1]))  # Output: False
```

This Python code defines a function below_zero that checks whether the balance of a bank account falls below zero during a sequence of deposit and withdrawal operations. It initializes a monitor whether all operations are non-zero, so it returns False. It then iterates through operations and checks whether the balance has fallen below zero at any point. If it has, it sets the balance_below_zero flag to True. Otherwise, it checks whether the balance became non-negative after an operation and, if it did, it sets the balance_below_zero flag to False. The function then returns the balance_below_zero flag, which indicates whether the balance ever fell below zero during the sequence of operations.
