```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation < 0:
            balance -= operation
        else:
            balance += operation
    return balance < 0
``` 
This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers as an argument, and returns a boolean indicating whether the balance of the account goes below zero after processing the operations. The script uses a specific logic to handle the operations and update the balance variable accordingly.
