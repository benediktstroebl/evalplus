```Python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance -= op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
``` 
The function below_zero takes a list of integers as an input, representing deposit and withdrawal operations from a bank account with an initial balance of 0. The function aims to detect if the balance of the account ever falls below zero during the execution of the operations. 

This is a sample solution that passes the test cases provided in the previous problem description.
