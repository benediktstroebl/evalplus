Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```
This function takes a list of operations, iterates through each operation, and checks if the balance ever falls below zero. It then returns True if this condition is met, and False otherwise.
