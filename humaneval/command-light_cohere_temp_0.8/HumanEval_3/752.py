Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you've described, along with tests to verify the functionality:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False

# Test cases
operations_test = [
    [1, 2, -4, 5],
    [-10, 20, 100],
    [0, 2, -1],
    [100, 0, -100]
]

for op in operations_test:
    result = below_zero(op)
    assert result == True

# Test passing negative balance
balance_test = -100
result = below_zero([100, 0, -100])
assert result == True
```
This code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations as input and determines whether the balance of the account falls below zero at any point in the operations. It iterates through balance variable, and in each iteration of the loop, the balance is increased by the value of the operation. The function returns `True` if the balance falls below zero at any point during the loop, indicating that the balance has become negative. 

Additionally, the code provides test cases to cover various scenarios, such as passing lists with different operations and a negative balance.  The tests are executed to verify the functionality of the `below_zero` function, and the results are expected to match the specified conditions.
