Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance = balance + operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
The provided code detects if the balance of the account ever falls below zero after processing a given list of deposit and withdrawal operations.
