Here's the Python script with the self-contained function `below_zero()` that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fall is
    below zero, and at that point function should return True. Otherwise, it should return False."""
    
    # Sort operations in ascending order to ensure we evaluate deposit operations before withdrawal.
    operations.sort(key=lambda op: op, -1)
    
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if op > 0:
            balance += op
        elif op < 0:
            return True
    
    return balance <= 0
```
The function uses a list of operations to determine whether the balance of the account falls below zero. The script also ensures that the operations are evaluated in the correct order, with deposits evaluated before withdrawals.
