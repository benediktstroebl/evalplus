Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem and passes the tests provided:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
# Test case 1
below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
# Test case 2
below_zero([1, 2, -3, -1])
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that checks if the operations in the given list will cause the balance of the account to fall below zero. The function uses a balance variable to keep track of the account balance and for each operation it checks if the balance will become negative.
