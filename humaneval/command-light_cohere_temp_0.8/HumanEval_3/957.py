Here's the self-contained Python script with a function below_zero() that solves the problem you provided:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```
This function takes a list of operations as an argument and uses a loop to iterate over each operation. It then updates the certain operation by subtracting the value of the operation from the balance. It checks for the certain that at any point if the balance falls below zero, the function returns True, otherwise, it continues to iterate through the operations and returns False.
