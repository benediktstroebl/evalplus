Here is the provided Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance -= op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This function takes a list of operations and iterates through each operation, subtracting the value from the balance. It then checks if the balance has fallen below zero and returns `True` if so, indicating that the balance is below zero. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating that the balance is not below zero.
