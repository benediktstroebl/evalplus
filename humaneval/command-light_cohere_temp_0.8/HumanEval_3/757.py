Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance += operation
    return False
```
This code defines a function below_zero that checks whether the account balance falls below zero or not, based on a list of operations (deposits and withdrawals). The balance is initialized to 0 and then updated accordingly with each operation. The function efficiently detects the wrong account balance condition and returns True.
