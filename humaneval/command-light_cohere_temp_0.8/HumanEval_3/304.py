Here is the provided Python script:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance += operation
    return False
```
This script defines a function `below_zero` that checks whether any operation in the given list of operations would cause the balance of the account to fall below zero. The script initializes the covered balance to zero and then iterates over the list of operations. If the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the balance has become negative and the function returns. If the balance is not negative at the end of the loop, the function returns `False`, indicating that the balance is within a valid range.
