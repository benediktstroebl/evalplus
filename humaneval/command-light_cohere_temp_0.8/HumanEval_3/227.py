Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:

```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= operation
    return False
```
The code defines a function `below_zero` that checks whether a list of operations can cause the balance of the account to go below zero. It initializes a
balance variable to 0 and iterates through each operation in the `operations` list. If any operation would causes a balance go below 0, the function immediately returns `True`. Otherwise, it subtracts the operation from the balance and returns `False` if the balance is no longer negative.
