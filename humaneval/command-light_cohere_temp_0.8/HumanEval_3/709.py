```

This code defines two functions: `below_zero` and `is_valid`. The `below_zero` function takes a list of operations as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance of the account falls below zero. The `is_valid` function takes a list of operations as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the operations are valid. The driver code is also included to test the `below_zero` and `is_valid` functions.
