Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem and passes the tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
    return balance < 0
```
The function iterates over each element in the list of operations, and accumulates the operations to update the balance. 
If the balance becomes less than 0, the function returns True, indicating that the balance fell below zero at some point in the operations.
