Here's the Python script with the self-contained function below_zero that checks if the balance falls below zero and returns True or False accordingly:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
    return balance < 0
```
This function below_zero takes a list of operations and starts with an initial balance. It then iterates through each operation and adds it to the balance. If the balance becomes below zero, the function returns True, otherwise, it returns False.

The above implementation is a good starting point, and you can improve it based on your specific requirements and further tests.
