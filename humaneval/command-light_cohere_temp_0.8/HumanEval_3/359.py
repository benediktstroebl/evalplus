```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance -= op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
# Tests
operations_test = [1, 2, -4, 5]
result = below_zero(operations_test)
assert result == True, "Expected: True, actual: " + result
```
The code defines a function called below_zero that takes a list of operations as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance of the account falls below zero. The balance is calculated by initializing a variable to 0 and then iteratively subtracting each operation from it. The code also includes a series of test cases to verify the functionality of the below_zero function.
