Here's a self-contained Python script that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= operation
    return False

# Test cases
tests = [
    [
        [1, 2, -4, 5],
    [-1, 2, -3, 5],
    [-10, 2, -8, 5],
    [0, 2, -5, 5],
]

for op, expected in tests:
    actual = below_zero(op)
    print(f"{op} is {actual} and should be {expected}")
```
This code defines a function below_zero that checks whether the account balance falls below zero after a sequence of operations are applied. It maintains a balance with 0 and updates it by the operations. The function then returns True if balance becomes negative, and False otherwise.
