Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False

# Test cases
# Test case 1
operations = [1, 2, -4, 5]
result = below_zero(operations)
print("Result:", result)

# Test case 2
operations = [0, 1, 2, -1]
result = below_zero(operations)
print("Result:", result)

# Test case 3
operations = [1, 2, -8, -6, 3]
result = below_zero(operations)
print("Result:", result)
```

The provided code addresses the task of detecting a sequence of bank account operations that can potentially cause the balance to go below zero. It employs a iterative approach, initially setting the balance to zero. The function then iterates over each operation in the input list, if the balance falls below zero, it returns True; otherwise, it updates the balance by subtracting the operation.

The test cases that follow are intended to verify the functionality of the below_zero function with various input scenarios. 

In this solution, the `below_zero` function accepts a list of integers as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance of the account falls below zero. The test cases aim to cover a range of scenarios, including scenarios where the balance starts with a positive value, operations are either positive or negative, and an invalid balance.
