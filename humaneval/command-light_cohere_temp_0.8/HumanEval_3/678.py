Here is the above-mentioned Python script:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of the account falls below zero, 
    and at that point, the function should return True. Otherwise, it should return False.
    >>> operations=[1, 2, 3]
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
    True
    >>> below_zero([0, -4, 5])
    False
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, -3, -4])
    True
    >>> below_zero([1, -100, -4])
    False
    >>> below_zero([1, -200, -4])
    True
    """
    operations.sort()
    def return_balance(account: int, operations: List[int]) -> bool:
        current = account
        for op in operations:
            current += op
            if current < 0: return True
        return False
    return return_balance

```

This script solves the problem of checking if the balance of a bank account falls below zero after a series of operations. The function takes a input of a list of operations, and a starting balance for the account. The function then iterates over each operation in the list, and adds the operation to the current balance. If at any point the would the balance of the account fall below zero, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.
