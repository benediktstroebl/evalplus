Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you described:

```python
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```
This function takes a list of operations as input and initializes a balance variable to zero. It then iterates over each operation in the list, checking if the balance falls below zero. If it does, it returns True, indicating that at least one of the operations caused the balance to go below zero. Otherwise, it returns False, indicating no operations caused the balance to fall below zero.
