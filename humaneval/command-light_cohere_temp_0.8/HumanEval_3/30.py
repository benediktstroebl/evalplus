```Python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
    return balance < 0
``` 
This Python function, below_zero, is designed to determine whether the starting balance of an account falls below zero after executing a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. The function accepts a specific operations, provided as a list of integers, and employs a loop to simulate the execution of these operations. It starts with an initial balance of 0 and, within the loop, adds each operation to the balance. When the balance falls below zero, the function immediately returns True, indicating that the balance has indeed fallen below zero. Otherwise, it continues executing the process, and if the balance ever exceeds or becomes equal to zero, the function will return False.
