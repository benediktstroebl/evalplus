Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem of checking for negative balance in a deposit and withdrawal operations list for a bank account:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```
This function takes a list of deposit and withdrawal operations as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance of the account falls below zero at any point in the operations. The function works by initializing a balance variable to zero and then iterating through each operation in the list. If the balance becomes negative, the function returns True, indicating that the account balance is below zero. If the balance does not become negative, the function returns False, indicating that the balance is not below zero.
