Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
The function takes a list of operations, adds them to the balance, and returns True if the balance fell below zero and False if it is still positive. The function tests pass with the given test cases, and it correctly identifies the conditions and returns the corresponding results.
