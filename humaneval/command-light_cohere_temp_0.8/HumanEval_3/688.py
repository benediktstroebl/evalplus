```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= operation
    return False
``` 
This code defines a function below_zero that takes a list of operations (deposit and withdrawal numbers) as input and determines whether any operation would cause the balance to fall below zero. 
The function initializes a balance to 0 and then iterates through each operation in the list. If at any point the watch the balance fall below zero, the function returns True. Otherwise, it continues to the next operation and returns False.
