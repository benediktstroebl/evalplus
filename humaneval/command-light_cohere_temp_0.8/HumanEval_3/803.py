Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """ You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fall below zero, and
    at that point function should return True. Otherwise, it should return False.
    >>> operations
    important [ operations: List[int]
    """
    operations.
    # Sort the difference in descending order.
    operations = sorted(operations)
    # Initialize balance as 0
    balance = 0
    # Initialize a flag to detect below-zero balance
    is_balance_below_zero = False
    # Iterate through operations
    for operation in operations:
        # Check if the balance is already below zero
        if balance < 0:
            # If balance is already below zero, return True
            is_balance_below_zero = True
        # Add the value of this operation to the balance
        balance += operation
        # If balance goes below zero, return True
        if balance < 0:
            is_balance_below_zero = True
    # If we reached the end of operations without going below zero, return False
    return is_balance_below_zero
```

The function takes a list of operations as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance went below zero at any point in the operations. The function sorts the operations in descending order and iterates through the operations. It checks if the balance is already below zero and if so, returns True. Otherwise, it adds the operations to the balance and checks if the balance goes below zero, in which case it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
