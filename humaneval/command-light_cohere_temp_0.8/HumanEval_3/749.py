```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
``` 
This code defines a function called below_zero, which takes a list of operations as input and returns a boolean value that indicates whether the balance of the account falls below zero at any point during the execution of the operations. 

The code initializes the balance to 0 and then goes through each operation, if the balance becomes negative, it returns True, otherwise it returns False. 

The function uses the balance variable to keep track of the account balance, and the loop iterates through each operation in the list. It subtracts the this operation from the balance and checks if the balance is negative. If so, it returns True, otherwise it returns False.
