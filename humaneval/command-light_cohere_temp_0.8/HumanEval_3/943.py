Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:

```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance = balance + operation
    if balance < 0:
        return True
    return False
```

This function checks if the balance of the account ever falls below zero. It iterates through operations and adds each operation to the current balance. If it ever goes into the negative territory, the function will return True. Otherwise, it will return False, indicating that the balance has never fallen below zero. 

The solution is self-contained and does not require any external functions or variables.
