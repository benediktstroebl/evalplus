```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
    if balance < 0:
        return True
    return False

# Test cases
operations = [1, 2, -4, 5]
result = below_zero(operations)
print(result)  # True

operations2 = [0, 1, 2, 3]
result2 = below_zero(operations2)
print(result2)  # False
```
This code defines a function called below_zero, which takes a list of operations as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance of the account falls below zero after applying all the operations. The balance is initialized to 0, and it accumulates the effects of each operation by adding them to the balance. The function returns True if the balance becomes negative, and False otherwise.
