Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the tests:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation < 0:
            balance -= operation
        else:
            balance += operation
    return balance < 0
```

This code defines a function `below_zero` that checks if the balance of a bank account falls below zero after applying a series of deposits and withdrawals. The function iterates through the balance, and for each operation, it checks if the operation is a withdrawal (`negative`) or a deposit (`positive`). If the operation is a withdrawal, it subtracts the amount from the balance. If the operation is a deposit, it adds the amount to the balance.
