Here's the Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
    return balance < 0
```
The above function takes a list of operations (deposit and withdrawal) as input and uses a loop to iterate over each operation. It then adds the operations to the balance and checks if the balance becomes less than zero, which means the account has gone below zero. If it meets this balance becomes negative, the function returns True, indicating that the balance went below zero at some point during the operations. If the balance remains non-negative throughout all operations, the function returns False, indicating that the balance never went below zero.
