```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance -= op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
``` 
This above code defines a function called below_zero that takes a list of operations and returns a boolean value that indicates if the balance of the account goes below zero. The function first initializes the the balance to 0 and then iterates through each operation in the operations list. If any operation causes a negative value, then the balance will be below 0, and the function will return True. Otherwise, the function will return False.
