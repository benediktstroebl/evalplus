Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you described:

```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
    return balance < 0
```

This script defines a function below_zero that takes a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value. The function initializes a balance with 0 and then iterates through each operation in the list, adding its value to the balance. After iterating through operations, the function returns whether the balance is less than 0, indicating that the account balance fell below zero.
