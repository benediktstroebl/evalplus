```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance = balance + operation
    if balance < 0:
        return True
    return False
```
We've created a Python function called below_zero, which takes a list of operations as input and determines whether the balance of the account falls below zero. It accomplishes this using a approach by starting with an initial balance of 0 and iteratively adding each operation to the balance. The function then checks if the balance becomes negative and returns True if so, indicating that the balance fell below zero. Otherwise, it returns False, indicating that the balance remained positive throughout the operations.

This function is self-contained and can be used to solve the problem of detecting negative balance in a bank account.
