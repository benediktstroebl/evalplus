Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation > 0:  # deposit operation
            balance += operation
        elif operation < 0:  # withdrawal operation
            if balance < 0:  # condition met
                return True
            balance -= operation
    return False
```
This function will return `True` if the balance falls below zero at any point during the loop, otherwise, it will return `False`.  This script is self-contained and does not import any other functions or modules.
