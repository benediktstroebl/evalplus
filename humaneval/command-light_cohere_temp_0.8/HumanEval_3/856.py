Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
# Test case
# Here is a test case that should return True.
 below operations = [1, 2, -4, 5]
result = below_zero(operations)
print(result)
``` 
The function below_zero takes a list of operations as input and initializes a balance variable to 0. It then iterates through operations, incrementing the balance variable by the value of each operation. If at any time, the balance falls below 0, the function returns True, indicating that the balance has fallen below zero. Otherwise, it returns False, indicating that the balance has not fallen below zero.
