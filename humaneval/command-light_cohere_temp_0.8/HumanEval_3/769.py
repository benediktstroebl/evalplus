Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function below_zero that checks if the balance of a bank account ever falls below zero. It uses a
type hint to specify the input types of the list of operations and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance ever fell below zero. 

```python
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Detects if the balance of account ever falls below zero,
    and returns True if it does. Otherwise, it returns False.
    """
    if any operation in operations is negative:
        return False
    """
    for operation in operations:
        if operation <= 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function is self-contained, and it takes a list of operations as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance of the account fell below zero at any point during the operations.
