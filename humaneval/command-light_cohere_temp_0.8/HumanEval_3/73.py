Here's the Python code that solves the problem and passes the tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```
This function takes a list of operations (deposit and withdrawal) and checks if the balance falls below zero at any point. It iterates through operations, and for each operation, it updates the balance by either subtracting a positive number (withdraw) or subtracting a negative number (deposit). If at any point the balance becomes negative, the function returns True, indicating that the balance has fallen below zero. Otherwise, it returns False.
