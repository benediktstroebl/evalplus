```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
    return balance < 0
``` 
This Python code defines a function `below_zero` that checks if the balance of an account falls below zero after applying a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. The function uses the example operations provided in the parameter `operations`, iterates through each operation, adding the value to the balance. This ensures that the balance will reflect the overall effect of the operations.

The function then returns `True` if the balance falls below zero, indicating that the account has gone into a negative balance state. The function returns `False` if the balance is non-negative, indicating that the account is still in a positive balance state.
