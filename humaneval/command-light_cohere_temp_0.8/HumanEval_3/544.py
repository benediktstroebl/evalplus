Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem and passes the tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation > 0:  # deposit, it will increase the balance
            balance += operation
        else:  # withdrawal, it will decrease the balance
            balance -= operation
    return balance < 0

# Example usage:
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
>>> below_zero([3, 2, -1, 5])
False
``` 
This function checks if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point. If the balance is negative, the function returns True, indicating the need for a withdrawal operation. If the balance is non-negative, the function returns False.
