Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance -= op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This code implements a function called below_zero that takes a list of operations and checks if any of these operations results in a balance below zero. The function iterates through each operation in the list and checks the balance after performing the operation. If the balance becomes negative, it returns True, otherwise, it returns False.
