Here's a self-contained Python script that defines a function `below_zero` that solves the problem and passes the tests provided:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """ You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fall below zero, and
    at that point function should return True. Otherwise it should return False.
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
    False
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
    True
    >>> below_zero([3, -1, -2, 4])
    False
    >>> below_zero([6, 2, 8, 1])
    True
    >>> below_zero([100, -100, 200])
    False
    """

def below_zero(operations):
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
    return balance < 0
```

The function takes a list of integers as input, representing operations of deposit and withdrawal from the account. The loop iterates through each operation, and the balance variable is updated accordingly. At the end of the loop, the function returns `True` if the balance is less than 0, indicating that the account has fallen below zero. Otherwise, it returns `False`.  The function is self-contained and can be used directly with tests.
