Here's the solution:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
    return balance < 0
```

This function takes a list of deposit and withdrawal operations as input and iteratively performs the operations on a balance variable. The function returns True if the balance falls below zero and False otherwise.

The solution is self-contained, it does not rely on any external functions or classes, and the logic is fully contained within the function.
