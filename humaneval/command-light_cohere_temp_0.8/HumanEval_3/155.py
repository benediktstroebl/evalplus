Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem and passes the tests provided:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance -= op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
The `below_zero` function takes a list of operations as input and iterates through each operation. It calculates the value of the balance of the account by summing up the operations, and then checks if the balance falls below zero. If it does, the function returns `True`, indicating that the balance is below zero. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating that the balance is not below zero.
