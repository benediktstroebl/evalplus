```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False

 # Test the function
    # Test with list of operations that should guarantee balance < 0
    operations = [1, 2, -4, 5]
    result = below_zero(operations)
    print(result)
    # Test with list of operations that should not guarantee balance < 0
    operations = [1, 2, 3]
    result = below_zero(operations)
    print(result)
``` 
This Python script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of integers as input. The function iterates over each operations and checks if the balance of the account ever falls below zero. If so, the balance is below zero, the function returns `True`, indicating that the condition is met. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating that the balance never fell below zero.
