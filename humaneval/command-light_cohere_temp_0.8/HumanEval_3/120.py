Here's a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you provided:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations):
    """
    You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of the account falls below zero, 
    and at that point, function should return True. Otherwise, it should return False.
    >>> operations = [1, 2, -4, 5]
    return operations[0] < 0
```
This function takes a list of operations and returns `True` if the opening operation is less than zero, indicating that the balance started at zero will go below zero during the operations. 

The function uses Python's List data structure to efficiently iterate over the operations and perform the comparison.
