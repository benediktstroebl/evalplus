```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
``` 
This script defines a function below_zero that checks if the balance of a bank account falls below zero after applying a series of deposits and withdrawals. The function uses the balance variable to keep track of the account balance and iterates over the list of operations. If the balance ever becomes negative, it returns True, otherwise, it returns False.
