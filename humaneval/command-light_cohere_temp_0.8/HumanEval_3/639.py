```Python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
# Example usage
below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) # returns True
below_zero([4, -8, -1, 1]) # returns False
``` 
This code is a self-contained Python solution for the problem described. The function takes a list of operations as input and iterates over each operation in the list. The function then checks if the balance is less than zero and returns True. If the balance is non-negative, it adds the value of the operation to the balance. This process continues until the balance reaches a non-negative value, at which point the function returns False, indicating that the balance is no longer below zero.
