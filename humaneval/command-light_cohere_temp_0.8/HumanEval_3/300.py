Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you described:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """ You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fall below zero, and
    at that point function should return True. Otherwise, it should return False.
    >>> operations
   
    balance_ 
    [1, 2, -4, 5]
    True
    """

# Similarly, you can add more test cases to validate the function's behavior

# Test case 1:
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Output: True

# Test case 2:
print(below_zero([1, 2, -3, 5]))  # Output: True

# Test case 3:
print(below_zero([-3, 2, -4, 5]))  # Output: True

# Test case 4:
print(below_zero([1, 2, 0, 5]))  # Output: False

# Test case 5:
print(below_zero([1, 0, -4, 5]))  # Output: True
```

This code provides a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations and checks if the balance falls below zero at any point. The output for each test cases shows the expected behavior of the function. 

Please note that the function can be further extended and modified to handle more complex scenarios and edge cases.
