Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
    if balance < 0:
        return True
    return False
```
This function below_zero takes a list of integers as input, representing deposit and withdrawal operations. It iterates through balance variable and starts with an initial balance of 0. It then iterates through each operation in the list and adds its value to the balance. Finally, it checks if the balance is less than 0, and if so, returns True, indicating that the account balance has fallen below zero. If the balance is not negative, the function returns False, indicating that the account balance is not below zero.
