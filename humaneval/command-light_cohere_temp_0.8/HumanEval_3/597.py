```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
    if balance < 0:
        return True
    return False
``` 
This function uses a loop to iterate over each element in the operations list, adding the value of each operation to the balance variable. The function will return True if the balance is less than zero, indicating that the account has fallen below zero. Otherwise, the function will return False, indicating that the balance has not fallen below zero yet.
