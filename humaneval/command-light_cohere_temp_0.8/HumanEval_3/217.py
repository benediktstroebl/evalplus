Here's the code that solves the problem you described:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation < 0:
            balance -= operation
        elif balance < 0 and operation == -balance:
            return True
    return False
```

This code takes a list of operations as input and iterates over the list. It starts with an initial balance of zero and checks if any operation would bring the balance below zero. If it finds such would either way (by the operation bringing the balance below zero or by an operation equal to the current balance), it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False, indicating that the balance never fell below zero.
