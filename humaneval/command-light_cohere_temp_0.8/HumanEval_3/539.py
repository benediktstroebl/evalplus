Here's the self-contained Python script with a function below_zero that solves the problem you've described:

```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= operation
    return False
```
The function takes a list of operations, which can be deposits or withdrawals, as input. It initializes the initial balance to zero, and then iterates over each operation in the list. When it encounters an operation that would decrease the balance, it returns True, otherwise, it subtracts the operation and checks if the balance is still non-negative, returning False.

In this way, the function effectively checks for operations that cause the balance to go below zero, and returns True in that case, indicating that the balance has fallen below zero.
