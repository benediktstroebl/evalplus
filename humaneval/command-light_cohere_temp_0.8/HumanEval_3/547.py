Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem you described:

```python
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
    return balance < 0
```
The function checks whether the account balance falls below zero at any point during the processing of a list of operations. The function uses a simple arithmetic to add the operations to the balance and checks whether it is negative, returning True if so, and False otherwise.
