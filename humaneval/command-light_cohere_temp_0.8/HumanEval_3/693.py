```Python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= operation
    return False
``` 
This script defines a function below_zero that takes a list of integers as input. It performs a balance calculation for each operation and returns True if the balance ever falls below zero, and False otherwise.
