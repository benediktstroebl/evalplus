Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of the account falls below zero, 
    and at that point, the function should return True. Otherwise, it should return False.
    """
    balance = 0
    for i, operation in operations:
        if operation < 0:
            balance -= operation
        elif operation > 0:
            balance += operation
    return balance < 0
```

This script defines a function below_zero that takes a list of operations as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance falls below zero at any point in the operations. The script implements the balance calculation logic, where it checks if each operation is a withdrawal or a deposit, and updates the balance accordingly. The balance is initialized to 0, and the function iterates through each operation in the list. If any operation is a negative, it subtracts the value from the balance, if the operation is positive, it adds the value to the balance. The function returns True the result of the balance is less than 0, indicating that the balance fell below zero during the operations.
