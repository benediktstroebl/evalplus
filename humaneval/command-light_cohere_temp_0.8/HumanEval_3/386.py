```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= operation
    return False
``` 
The code defines a function below_zero that takes a list of integers as input, representing operations on a bank account balance. It uses a technique to iterate through the operations, starting with an initial balance of 0. The function checks for negative balance operations and returns True if any of the operations would result in a balance below 0. Otherwise, it returns False.
