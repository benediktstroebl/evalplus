```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance -= op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
We've created a self-contained Python function below_zero that solves the problem of checking if the balance of a bank account ever falls below zero given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations. 

The function starts with an initial balance of 0 and iterates through each operation in the list. If at any time the still 0, the function will have decremented the balance below zero, and will return True.
