Here is a Python script that defines a function below_zero that checks if the balance of a given bank account starts with zero and subsequently undergoes series of deposit and withdrawal operations that could potentially make it negative:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fall below zero, and
    at that point function should return True. Otherwise it should return False.
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
    False
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
    True
    >>> below_zero([5, -1, 3, 2, -8, 1])
    False
    """
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation > 0:
            balance += operation
        elif operation < 0:
            balance -= operation
    return balance < 0
``` 
The function iterates through the list of operations and for each operation, it adds or subtracts the corresponding amount from the balance. The function returns True if the balance is less than zero, indicating that the account balance has fallen below zero. 

Note that this function assumes that all operations are either deposits or withdrawals, and it doesn't handle cases where the same operation is repeated or different operations are mixed.
