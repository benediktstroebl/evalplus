Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of checking for negative balances in a list of operations:
```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False

# Example usage
operations = [1, 2, -4, 5]
result = below_zero(operations)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

This script defines a function called below_zero that takes a list of integers as input. The function initializes a balance to zero and iterates through each operation in the list. If the balance falls below zero, the function returns True, indicating a negative balance. If the balance remains non-negative, the function returns False. The provided test code passes successfully and demonstrates the functionality of the below_zero function.
