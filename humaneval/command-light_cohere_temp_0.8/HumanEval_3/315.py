Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the tests provided:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """ You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fall below zero, and
    at that point function should return True. Otherwise, it should return False.
    >>> operations = [1, 2, -4, 5]
    >>> below_zero(operations)
    True
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
    True
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, 3, -4])
    False
    >>> below_zero([1, -2, -4, 5])
    True
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    False
    >>> below_zero([100, 101, 102])
    False
    """

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    # Initialize a flag to track balance below zero
    balance_below_zero = False
    
    # Loop through each operation
    for op in operations:
        if balance_below_zero and op > 0:
            # If balance is already below zero and the operation is positive, return True
            return True
        elif balance_below_zero and op < 0:
            # If balance is already below zero and the operation is negative, return True
            return True
        elif op == 0:
            # If the operation is zero, add it to the balance
            balance_below_zero = balance_below_zero + 1
            continue
        else:
            # If the operation is not zero or positive or negative, subtract it from the balance
            balance_below_zero = balance_below_zero - op
            continue
    
    # If the balance is still below zero after all operations, return True
    return balance_below_zero
```

This code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance of the account falls below zero. The function uses a loop through each operation and checks if the balance falls below zero at any point. The function returns `True` if the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise.
