Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```
This function uses a loop to iterate through each operation in the list. It starts with an initial balance of 0 and checks if the balance ever falls below zero. If it does, the function returns True, indicating that the balance fell below zero at some point in the operations. Otherwise, it returns False.
