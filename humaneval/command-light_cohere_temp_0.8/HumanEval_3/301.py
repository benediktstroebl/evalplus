Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of checking for operations that would cause a balance below zero:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    # Initialize a flag to track if balance falls below zero
    balance = 0
    is_below_zero = False

    # Iterate through each operation
    for operation in operations:
        # If the current operation is less than 0, set the flag and balance accordingly
        if operation < 0:
            balance -= operation
            is_below_zero = True
        # If the balance falls below zero, return True
        elif balance < 0:
            return True
        # If the balance is not negative, reset the flag and balance to 0
        balance += operation

    # If no operation caused the balance to be negative, return False
    return is_below_zero
```

This code defines a function below_zero that takes a list of operations as an argument. The function initializes a balance to 0 and a flag to track if the balance has fallen below zero. It then iterates through each operation and sets the flag and balance accordingly. If the balance falls below zero, it returns True. If the balance is not negative after all operations, it returns False.
