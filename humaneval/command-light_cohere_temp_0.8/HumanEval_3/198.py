Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you described: 

```python
from typing import List
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation > 0:
            balance += operation
        elif operation < 0:
            balance -= operation
    return balance < 0
```

The function `below_zero` takes a list of integers `operations` as input and returns a boolean value `True` if the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. 

To test the function, you can use the provided test cases in the prompt. 

This function implements a simple but efficient solution to the problem by iterating over the operations and updating the balance variable accordingly.
