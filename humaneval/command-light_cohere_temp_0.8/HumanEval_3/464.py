Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```

This script defines a function below_zero that takes a list of operations and checks if the balance of the account ever falls below zero.  If uses a process of iterating over the operations, if the balance ever becomes negative, the function will return True. If the balance is kept positive throughout the loop, the function will return False.
