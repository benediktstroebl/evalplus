Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you provided:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= operation
    return False
```
This function takes a list of operations (deposits and withdrawals) as input and returns a boolean value that indicates whether the balance fell below zero at any point during the operations. The function uses a approach of iterating through each operation and checking if the balance becomes negative. If the balance becomes negative, the function returns True, otherwise, it returns False.
