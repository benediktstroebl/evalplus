Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This code defines a function `below_zero` that checks whether the balance of a bank account falls below zero after applying a series of deposits and withdrawals. It iterates through balance variable to keep track of the account balance and iterates over the `operations` list. If at any time, the balance falls below zero, the function returns `True`, indicating that the balance is indeed below zero. Otherwise, it returns `False` to indicate that the balance is still positive after processing all operations.
