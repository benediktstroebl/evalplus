Here's the solution to the markdown code block you provided:

```python
def below_zero(operations):
    """
    You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fall below zero, 
    and at that point function should return True. Otherwise, it should return False.
    """
Here's a recursive function that solves the problem:
    If operations = []:
        return False
    elif len(operations) == 1:
        return operations[0] < 0
    else:
        return any(below_zero(operations[1:]))
``` 

This code is designed to determine if a bank account, starting with an initial balance of zero, will ever fall below zero after executing a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. It employs a recursive logic to assess this, with early exits for empty lists and operations of length 1. The primary logic is to determine if any operation is negative, which would result in a balance below zero. 

The function uses the any function to check the existence of negative values in the remaining operations if the length of operations is greater than one.
