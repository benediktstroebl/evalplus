Here is a Python script that implements the below_zero function, which solves the problem of checking for negative balances in a list of deposit and withdrawal operations:
```python
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fall below zero, and
    at that point function should return True. Otherwise, it should return False.
    >>> [1, 2, 3]
    False
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
    True
    >>> below_zero([4, -2, 3, -1])
    False
    >>> below_zero([9, -8, 6])
    True
    """
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
    return balance < 0
```
The script defines a function below_zero that takes a list of operations (integers) as an argument. It then initializes a balance to zero and iterates over each operation in the list. The script checks if the balance becomes negative. 

This function is self-contained and can be easily integrated into other scripts to solve the problem of checking negative balance in a bank account.
