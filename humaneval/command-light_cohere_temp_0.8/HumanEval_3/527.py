```Python
from typing import List
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
    return balance < 0
``` 
This code defines a function below_zero that takes a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value. It uses a balance variable to keep track of the current balance of the account. The loop iterates through operations in the list and adds each operation to the balance. 

The test returns True if the balance is less than 0, indicating that the account balance has fallen below zero, and False otherwise.
