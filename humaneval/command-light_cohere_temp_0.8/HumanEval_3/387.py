Here's a self-contained Python script that defines a function `below_zero` solving the problem you provided:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance = balance + operation
    if balance < 0:
        return True
    return False
```

This function uses a loop to process each integer in the operations list. It starts with an initial balance of 0, and for each operation, it adds the operation to the balance. Then, it checks if the balance is now negative, which would indicate that the account balance has fallen below zero, and if so, the function returns True. Otherwise, it continues processing the
