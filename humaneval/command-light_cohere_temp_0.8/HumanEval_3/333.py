```Python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
    return balance < 0
``` 
This code defines a function called below_zero, which takes a list of integers as its parameter. It initializes a balance with 0 and then iterates over each element in the operations list, adding each one to the balance. Finally, it checks if the balance is less than 0 and returns True if the balance is indeed negative, indicating that the markdown code was able to solve the problem.
