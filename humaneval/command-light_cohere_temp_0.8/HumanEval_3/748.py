Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance -= op
    return balance < 0
```
The function checks if the operations result in a balance that is less than zero, and returns True. If the balance remains non-negative, the function returns False.

Note that the function assumes that each operation in the list is a withdrawal operation, and it assumes that the account starts with zero balance. 
This approach is simple and straightforward, but it is not the most efficient. It could be improved by using a more sophisticated data structure to help optimize the process.
