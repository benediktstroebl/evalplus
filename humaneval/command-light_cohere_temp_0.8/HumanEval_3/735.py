```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False

 ``` 
This Python function below_zero takes a list of integers as input, representing a sequence of deposit and withdrawal operations for a bank account. It initializes a particular balance to 0, and then iterates through each operation in the list. If at any point the If balance falls below zero, the function will immediately return True, indicating the account balance has fallen below zero. Otherwise, it will proceed to the next operation, subtracting the current value of the balance by the operation value. This process continues until the the balance becomes greater than zero, in which case the function will return False, indicating no balance is below zero.
