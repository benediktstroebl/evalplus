Here's a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you described: 

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    # Your function definition goes here
    pass

# Test case goes here
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True
```

This Python script defines a function `below_zero` that checks whether the operations in a given list result in a negative balance for the bank account. The `List` function takes a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value `True` if the list contains operations that result in a negative balance and `False` otherwise.
