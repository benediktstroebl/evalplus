Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance = balance + operation
    if balance < 0:
        return True
    return False
```
This script defines a function called below_zero that takes a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance falls below zero. The function uses a loop to iterate through each element in the list, adding each operation to the balance. The function then checks if the balance is less than zero, and if so, returns True. If the balance is not less than zero, the function returns False.
