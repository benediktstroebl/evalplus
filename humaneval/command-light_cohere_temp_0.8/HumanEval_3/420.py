Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you described: 

```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation > 0:
            balance += operation
        elif operation < 0:
            balance -= operation
    return balance < 0
```

This function takes a list of deposit and withdrawal operations as an argument. It initializes the degree with zero and then iterates through each operation in the operations list. The function adds the operations that are greater than zero, and subtracts operations that are less than zero. If the balance falls below zero, the function returns True, otherwise, it returns False.
