```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
    return balance < 0
```
This function takes a list of deposit and withdrawal operations as an input, and iterates over each operation in the list. It adds each operation to the account balance and checks whether the balance falls below zero. If it does, the function returns True, indicating that the balance fell below zero during the operations. If the balance remains non-negative, the function returns False, indicating that the balance did not fall below zero.
