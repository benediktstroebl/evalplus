```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
``` 
This code defines a function called below_zero, which takes a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance of the account falls below zero after processing the operations. The balance variable is initialized to zero, and the loop iterates through each operation in the list. If at any point the value of balance goes negative, the function will return True, indicating that the balance of the account has fallen below zero. Otherwise, it will return False. The test case is also passed, which can be used to verify the correctness of the function.
