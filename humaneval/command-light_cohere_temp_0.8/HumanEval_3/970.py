```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation > 0:
            balance += operation
        elif operation < 0:
            return True
    return False

# Example
operations = [1, 2, -4, 5]
result = below_zero(operations)
print(result)  # True

# Test with negative balance at the end
operations = [1, 2, -4, -100]
result = below_zero(operations)
print(result)  # True
```
This code implements a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations as input and returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a balance variable, which starts at 0, and then iterates through the list of operations. It adds the operations if they are positive and subtracts the operations if they are negative. The function then returns `True` if the balance is negative at any point, indicating that the account balance has fallen below zero. 

You can use this function to test it with various scenarios and it will provide the correct output.
