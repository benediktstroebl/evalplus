Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation < 0:
            balance -= operation
        else:
            balance += operation
    return balance < 0
```
The `below_zero` function takes a list of integers as an argument, where each element represents a deposit or withdrawal operation. The function initializes a balance with 0, and then iterates through each operation in the list. When an operation is negative, the balance is decreased by that operation, otherwise, it is increased. The function returns True if the balance becomes negative, indicating that the account balance fell below zero, and False otherwise.
