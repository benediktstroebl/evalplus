Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """ You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fall below zero, and
    at that point function should return True. Otherwise it should return False.
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
    False
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
    True
    >>> below_zero([5, -1, -3])
    False
    >>> below_zero([0, 1, 2])
    False
    >>> below_zero([0, 0, 1])
    False
    >>> below_zero([100, 101, 102])
    True
    """
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
    return balance < 0
```
The function checks if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point during the loop, and returns True if it does. If the loop completes and the balance is still 0, it means the account never fell below zero and the function returns False.
