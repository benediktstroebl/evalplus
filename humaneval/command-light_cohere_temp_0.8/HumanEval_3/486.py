Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem and passes the tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
The function takes a list of operations as input and iterates over each operation. It updates the unique account balance in each iteration and checks if the balance ever falls below zero. If it finds such balance falls below zero, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

This function is fully self-contained and can be used to solve the problem and pass the tests you provided.
