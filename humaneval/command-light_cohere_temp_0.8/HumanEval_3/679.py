Here is the self-contained Python script that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= operation
    return False
```
The function takes a list of operations and checks if any of the operations would result in a balance below zero. It uses a the result in the operations is -4, the balance is set to -5, and the loop iterates over the operations. The balance is checked against 0, and if it becomes less than zero, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

This is a simple and straightforward implementation of the problem. It can easily be adapted and improved to be more efficient and more readable.
