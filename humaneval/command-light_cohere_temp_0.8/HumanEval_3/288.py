```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance = balance + operation
    if balance < 0:
        return True
    return False
``` 
The above Python script has a self-contained function below_zero, which takes a list of operations as input and returns a boolean value that indicates whether the balance of the account falls below zero. The function initializes a balance to 0 and then iterates through each operation in the list. It adds the operations to the balance variable and checks if the balance falls below 0. If it is, the function returns True, indicating that the balance is indeed below zero. Otherwise, it returns False, indicating that the balance is not below zero.
