Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance = balance + operation
    if balance < 0:
        return True
    return False
```

This script defines a function below_zero that takes a list of integers as an argument. The function initializes a balance with 0 and then loops through the operations, adding each operation to the balance. When it reaches an operation that would cause the balance to be less than 0, the function returns True, indicating that the balance has fallen below zero. Otherwise, it returns False.
