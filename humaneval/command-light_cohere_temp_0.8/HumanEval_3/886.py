Here's the Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```
This function takes a list of operations, where each element is an integer representing a deposit or withdrawal from the account. The function iterates through the balance and each operation, and checks if the balance goes below zero. If so, it returns True, indicating the account balance went below zero, and the function has successfully detected an invalid state. Otherwise, it returns False, indicating the account is in a valid state.
