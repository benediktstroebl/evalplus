Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you have described:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation < 0:
            balance -= operation
        else:
            break
    return balance < 0

# Test the function
operations = [1, 2, -4, 5]
result = below_zero(operations)
print(result)  # Output: True

# Test with starting balance
operations = [0, 1, 2, -4, 5]
balance = 0
result = below_zero(operations)
print(result)  # Output: False
```
This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance of the account falls below zero after processing the operations. 
The function iterates through each operation in the list and if an operation is negative, it will subtract it from the balance. If the balance is still non-negative after processing all operations, the loop breaks and the function returns `False`.  Otherwise, if the balance is zero, the function will return `True`.  This function is then tested with different inputs and the expected behavior is confirmed.
