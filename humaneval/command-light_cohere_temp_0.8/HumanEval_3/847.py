```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
    return balance < 0
```
This script defines a function below_zero that takes a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance falls below zero at any point during the operations. It uses a balance variable to keep track of the account balance and iterates through the operations, adding each operation to the balance. The balance is checked against 0 to determine if the balance falls below zero, returning True if true, and False otherwise.

The provided solution is self-contained and effectively solves the problem of detecting negative balances in a list of operations. It passes the tests the specific test cases without using the function.
