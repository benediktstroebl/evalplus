Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
    if balance < 0:
        return True
    return False
```
This script defines a function below_zero that checks if the balance of the account falls below zero.  It is process iterates through the list of operations (deposits and withdrawals) and adds each operation to the current balance. 

This function uses the typing module, which provides type hints and static type checking for Python code.
