```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fall below zero, and
    at that point function should return True. Otherwise it should return False.
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
    False
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
    True
    >>> below_zero([1,2,3,4])
    False
    >>> below_zero([0, 1, 2, 3])
    True
    >>> below_zero([9, -8, 1])
    False
    >>> below_zero([5, 10, -15])
    True
    """
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
    return balance < 0
``` 
The code defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations as an argument and checks whether the balance of the account falls below zero at any point. 
By iterating through the operations, the balance variable is updated, and if at any point, it becomes less than zero, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. 

This code demonstrates how to solve the given problem using a self-contained function with a clear and concise structure.
