```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= operation
    return False
```
This function takes a list of operations as input and uses a loop to iterate through each operation. The function starts with an initial balance of 0. It then checks if the balance becomes less than 0. If it is, the function returns True, indicating that the account balance has fallen below zero. Otherwise, the function returns False. The function uses the method of the loop to handle the operations, ensuring that the balance is updated correctly and the condition is met to return the correct result.
