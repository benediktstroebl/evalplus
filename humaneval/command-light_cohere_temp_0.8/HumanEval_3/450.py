Here is a Python script that includes a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:

```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= operation
    return False


# Test cases
operations = [1, 2, -4, 5]
result = below_zero(operations)
print(result)  # True

operations2 = [1, 2, 3, -5]
result2 = below_zero(operations2)
print(result2)  # False
```

This script defines a function below_zero that checks if any operation in a list of deposit and withdrawal operations would cause the balance to fall below zero. It uses a balance = 0 and for each operation, if the balance becomes negative, it returns True, otherwise, it continues iterating.

The script also includes test cases, and the function is called with two different lists of operations. The function returns True for operations containing a series of deposits and a withdrawal, and False for a series of deposits and a positive withdrawal.
