Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of integers `operations` as input. The function initializes a balance to zero and iterates through the list of operations. During the iteration, it checks if the balance falls below zero and returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The test code passes the test successfully because the balance does not fall below zero after the iterations.
