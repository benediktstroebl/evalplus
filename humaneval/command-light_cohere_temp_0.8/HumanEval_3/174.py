Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem and passes the tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with a zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of the account falls below zero, and at that point, function should return True. Otherwise, it should return False."""
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance -= op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
The function below_zero takes a list of operations, and checks if at any point the balance falls below zero. It then returns True if this balance is indeed less than zero, and False otherwise.
