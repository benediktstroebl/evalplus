Here's a self-contained Python script that solves the problem and passes the tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```
This script defines a function below_zero that takes a list of operations (integers) as input. It initializes a particular operations and starts iterating over the list. Then, it checks if the balance of the account goes below zero, and returns True. Otherwise, it updates the balance with the effect of each operation and returns False.
