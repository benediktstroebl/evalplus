```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= operation
    return False
``` 
The code defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of operations as input. It iterates through operations and starts with an initial balance of 0. The function checks if the operations cause the balance to fall below zero, and if so, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
