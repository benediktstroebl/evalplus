Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of checking if the balance of a bank account ever falls below zero, as described in your prompt:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance -= op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This script defines a function below_zero that takes a list of operations and returns a boolean value. The function iterates through each operation in the list, and if the balance of the account ever falls below zero, the function returns True. If the balance stays positive, the function returns False.
