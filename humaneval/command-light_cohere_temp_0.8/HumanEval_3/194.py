Here's the provided Python script:

```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= operation
    return False
```
This function `below_zero` takes a list of operations as an argument and iterates through the list. It keeps track of the balance, starting with 0, and for each operation, it checks if the balance goes below 0. If the balance falls below 0, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
