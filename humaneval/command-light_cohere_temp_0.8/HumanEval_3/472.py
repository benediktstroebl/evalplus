Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem of checking if the balance of a bank account ever falls below zero, as described in the markdown code block you provided:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations):
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
    return balance < 0
```
This function takes a list of operations as input and uses a loop to iterate through each operation, adding its value to the balance variable. The function returns True if the balance ever becomes less than zero, indicating that the account balance has fallen below zero at some point during the operations.
