Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """ 
    You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fall below zero, 
    and at that point function should return True. Otherwise, it should return False.
    >>> operations=[1, 2, 3]
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
    True
    >>> operations = [0, 2, -1, 1, 3, 4]
    >>> below_zero(operations)
    False
    >>> operations = [6, 2, -3]
    >>> below_zero(operations)
    True
    """

    for num in operations:
        if num < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This function takes a list of operations and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance of the account has fallen below zero. The function uses a loop through each operation in the list and checks if the operation is a negative number. If any negative number is detected, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
