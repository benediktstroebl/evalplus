```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```
This Python function, `below_zero`, takes a list of integers `operations` as input. The function aims to detect if the balance of a hypothetical account ever falls below zero, and returns `True` if this is the case, and `False` otherwise. 

The function initializes a balance to zero and then iterates over each operation in the input list. Each operation is adds its withdrawal from the balance (negative values decrease the balance), and a deposit adds to the balance (positive values increase the balance). 

After iterating over all operations, the function returns `False` if the balance is still non-negative, indicating that the account balance never fell below zero. 
If the balance is already negative, the function immediately returns `True`. 

This self-contained function demonstrates how to solve the problem of detecting account balances falling below zero in a single pass.
