```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance -= op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
``` 
This code defines a function below_zero that takes a list of operations as input. It iterates through operations and checks whether the balance falls below zero at any point. If it does, the function returns True, indicating that the balance is indeed below zero. Otherwise, it returns False. 

This function follows the logic of the above prompt.
