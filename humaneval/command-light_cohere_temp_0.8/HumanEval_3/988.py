Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you've described, along with a sample test case:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    # Function to check if the account balance ever falls below zero
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
    if balance < 0: return True
    return False
```
You can use this function with any list of deposit and withdrawal operations to determine if the account balance will ever go negative.
