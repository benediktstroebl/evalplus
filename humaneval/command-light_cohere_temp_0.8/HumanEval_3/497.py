```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
    if balance < 0:
        return True
    return False
``` 
This Python script defines a function `below_zero` that checks if the operations in an input list result in a balance below zero. It initializes a for the balance to 0 and iterates through each operation in `operations` and adds its value to the balance. If at any point the read value becomes negative, it does not reach the below-zero threshold, and the function returns `True`.
