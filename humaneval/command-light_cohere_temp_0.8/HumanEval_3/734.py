Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```

This function below_zero takes a list of operations as an input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance of the account falls below zero at any point in the loop. It uses a balance variable to keep track of the current balance and iterates through the operations. The function works by subtracting each operation from the balance, if the balance becomes negative, it returns True, indicating that the balance has fallen below zero. If the balance does not become negative, it returns False, indicating that the balance has not fallen below zero.
