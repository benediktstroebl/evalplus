```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= operation
    return False
```
This code defines a function below_zero that checks a list of deposit and withdrawal operations against a hypothetical account balance. It starts with an initial balance of 0 and iterates over each operation in the operations list. When the balance falls below zero during the operations, the function returns True. When the balance doesn't fall below zero and all operations are successfully processed, the function returns False.
