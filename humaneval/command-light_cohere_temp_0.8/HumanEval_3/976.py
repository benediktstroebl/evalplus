Here is the improved Python script with self-contained function below_zero, which accurately determines whether the balance falls below zero:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of the account falls below zero, and
    at that point function should return True. Otherwise, it should return False.
    # example usage
    actual implementation of the function
    """
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance += operation
    return False
```
The 'below_zero()' function takes a list of integers as input, which are the operations performed on the bank account. The function starts with an balance of 0 and iterates over the list of operations. It adds each operation to the balance and checks if the balance falls below 0. If it finds that the balance falls below zero, it returns True, indicating that the balance has indeed fallen below zero. Otherwise, it returns False, indicating that the balance has not fallen below zero.
