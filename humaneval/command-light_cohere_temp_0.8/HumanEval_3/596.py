Here's the improved solution with a function that checks if the balance falls below zero based on the operations provided: 
```python
from typing import List
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    # Sort operations in descending order to quickly reach balance zero
    operations.sort(operations, reverse=True)
    
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    
    return False

# Test cases
# Test 1: Should return True
below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])

# Test 2: Should return False
below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])

# Test 3: Should return False
below_zero([2, 3, 4, 5])

# Test 4: Should return False
below_zero([10, -5, -10, 20])
``` 
The script above includes a function called below_zero, which accepts a list of operations as an argument. It then sorts these operations in descending order, which allows the balance to be quickly reduced to zero. The function iterates over the operations, increasing the balance by each operation. If the balance becomes less than zero, it returns True, indicating that the balance fell below zero. If the loop completes without reaching zero, it returns False, indicating that the balance was not less than zero. 

This self-contained solution effectively checks if the balance falls below zero and returns the appropriate result based on the operations provided.
