Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the tests provided:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fall below zero, 
    and at that point function should return True. Otherwise, it should return False.
    >>> operations = [1, 2, -4, 5]
    """
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if op > 0:
            balance += op
        elif op < 0:
            return True
    return balance < 0
```

This code is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of checking if the balance of a bank account falls below zero. The function uses a `List` to pass parameters and uses a loop to iterate through the operations. It maintains track of the balance and uses the condition `if op > 0` to add the operation to the balance, and `elif op < 0` to check if the operation is a withdrawal and if it is, the balance is below zero, then the function returns `True`.
