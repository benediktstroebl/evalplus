```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
``` 
This script defines a function below_zero that takes a list of operations as an input and returns a boolean value that indicates whether the balance of the account falls below zero. The function initializes a balance to 0, and then iterates through the list of operations. It checks if the balance becomes negative and if so, returns True, indicating that the balance is below zero. Otherwise, it subtracts the operations from the balance and returns False if the balance is non-negative.
