Here's a self-contained Python script that implements the function `below_zero` from the prompt, which solves the problem of checking if the balance of the account falls below zero:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
    return balance < 0
```
This function takes a list of operations (deposit and withdrawal) as input and uses a loop to update the balance of the account after each operation. It returns `True` if the balance becomes negative and False otherwise.
