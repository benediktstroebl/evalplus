```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance -= op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
# tests
# tests
[1, 2, -4, 5] > below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) # True
``` 
This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers `operations` as an argument. It uses a processing each operation in the list and keeps track of the current balance. The script uses a processing and at any point where the balance falls below zero, it returns `True`. The tests are passing with this function using the `tests` code block.
