Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= operation
    return False
```

This script defines a function below_zero that takes a list of operations and determines if the balance falls below zero at any point. The loop iterates through the the operations and checks if the balance ever becomes negative. The function returns True if any of the operations result in a negative balance, and False otherwise.
