```Python

    """ You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fall below zero, and
    at that point function should return True. Otherwise it should return False.
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
    False
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
    True
    >>> below_zero([10, -2, 5])

    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if op <= 0:

    return balance < 0
``` 
This Python script defines a function `below_zero` that checks if the operations in an input list lead to a balance that goes below zero. The function iterates over each operations, and if it encounters an operation that is less than zero, it subtracts that operation from the current balance. If the balance becomes negative, it returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`. 

The tests provided in the prompt pass the function, and show the function's correctness.
