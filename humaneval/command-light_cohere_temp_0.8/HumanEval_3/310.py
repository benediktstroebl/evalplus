Here's a self-contained Python script that implements the `below_zero` function from the previous prompt: 

```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
``` 

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations, iterates over the operations, and checks if any of the operations causes the balance to go below zero. The function returns `True` if any of these operations result in a balance below zero, and `False` otherwise.
