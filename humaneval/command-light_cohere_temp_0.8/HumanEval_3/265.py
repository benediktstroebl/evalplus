    >>> operations = [1, 2, -4, 5]

``` 
The code defines a function `below_zero` that checks if the operations in an account start with a zero balance. It uses a Python's `type` to make sure the input `operations` list has integer elements. The loop iterates over each operation and checks if the operation is negative. The `return True` statement is executed if any operation is negative, indicating a falling balance below zero.
