Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem:
```python
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```

This function takes a list of deposit and withdrawal operations and checks if the balance ever falls below zero.  If simple loop iterates operations and check if the balance goes negative at any point, and return True. If not, it returns False.
