Here is the Python script that solves the problem and passes the tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
The `below_zero` function takes a list of integers `operations` as input and uses a loop to iterate over the list. It starts with an initial balance of 0 and checks if the balance falls below zero after adding each operation. If the balance becomes negative, the function returns `True`, indicating that the account balance fell below zero. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This function can be used to detect if the balance of a bank account falls below zero, which is the condition specified in the documentation you provided.
