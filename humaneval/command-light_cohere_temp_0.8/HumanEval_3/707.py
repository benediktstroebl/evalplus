Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem and passes the tests provided:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation < 0:
            balance -= operation
        else:
            balance += operation
    return balance < 0
```
The function takes a list of operations as input and iterates through each operation. During this process, it adds the operations to the balance if the operation is positive, and subtracts the operations from the balance if the operation is negative.
