```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
``` 
This Python script defines a function below_zero that takes a list of integers as input, representing deposit and withdrawal operations. It initializes a balance with 0, then iterates through each operation, checking if the balance falls below zero. If any operation causes a this condition, the function returns True. Otherwise, it continues with the next operation and returns False.
