Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```
The function checks if the balance falls below zero. If it does, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
