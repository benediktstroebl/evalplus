Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function that solves the problem and passes the tests provided:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """ You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fall below zero, and
    at that point function should return True. Otherwise it should return False.
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
    False
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
    True
    >>> below_zero([6, -10, 3])
    False
    >>> below_zero([0, 1, 1, -3])
    True
    """
    for num in operations:
        if num < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of integers as an argument. The function loops through the process all the integers in the list and returns a boolean value of True if any of the integers are less than zero, otherwise, it returns False.
