```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of the account falls below zero, and
    at that point function should return True. Otherwise, it should return False.

    precise, by returning the boolean value based on the balance condition.
    """

Here is a self-contained Python function that detects whether the value falls below zero:
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    for operation in operations:
        if operation < 0:
            return True
    return False
