```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
``` 
This code defines a function below_zero, that checks a list of operations for negative balance and returns a boolean value. 

Let's breakdown the code:
- The function takes a list of operations as an argument.
- A variable balance is initialized to zero.
- The loop iterates over the operations and performs the deposit and withdrawal operations.
- If condition if the balance falls below zero, the function immediately returns True.
- Otherwise, the balance is decreased by the operation and this operation is part of the loop.
- After the loop completes, the function returns False, which means that the balance is not below zero.
