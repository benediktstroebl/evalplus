```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
``` 
This code defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers as input, representing a sequence of deposit and withdrawal operations for a bank account. It uses a approach similar to the balance of the account, starting with zero, and iterates through each operation in the list. If the balance falls below zero at any point, the function returns `True`, indicating that the account balance has gone below zero. Otherwise, it continues the operations and returns `False`. 

You can use this function in your markdown code block to solve the problem.
