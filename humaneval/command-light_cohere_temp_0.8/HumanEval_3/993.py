Here's a Python script that solves the markdown code block problem:
```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """ You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fall below zero, and
    at that point function should return True. Otherwise, it should return False.
    >>> operations
    quick_depos: [1, 2, 3]
    >>> below_zero(quick_depos)
    True
    >>> operations_with_withdraw: [-4, 5, 1, -2, 3]
    >>> below_zero(operations_with_withdraw)
    False
    >>> operations_insufficient_zero: [10, 1, -20]
    >>> below_zero(operations_insufficient_zero)
    True
    """

# Your function to check if balance falls below zero
def is_balance_below_zero(balance: int, operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """ Check if the balance falls below zero.
    if balance < 0:
        return True
    elif all(operation <= 0 for operation in operations):
        return False
    else:
        return True
    """

# Test the function with sample inputs
test_balance = 10  # Starting balance
quick_depos = [1, 2,3]  # Operations to quick deposit

if is_balance_below_zero(test_balance, quick_depos):
    print("Balance is below zero")

operations_with_withdraw = [-4,5,1,-2,3]  # Operations with withdrawal

if is_balance_below_zero(test_balance, operations_with_withdraw):
    print("Balance is below zero")

operations_insufficient_zero = [10,1,-20]  # Operations that are less than zero

if is_balance_below_zero(test_balance, operations_insufficient_zero):
    print("Balance is below zero")
```

This script defines a function `is_balance_below_zero` that checks if the balance falls below zero based on a series of operations. The operations can include deposits and withdrawals, and the function returns `True` if any of the operations is less than zero, or if the starting balance is zero. The script also includes test cases to demonstrate the functionality of the function.
