Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you provided:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of integers as input. It iterates through operations on the balance, and if the balance ever falls below zero, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This self-contained function solves the problem without using any external imports.
