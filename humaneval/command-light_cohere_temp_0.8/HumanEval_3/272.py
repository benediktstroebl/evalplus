Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem and passes the tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
    return balance < 0
```

This script defines a function below_zero that takes a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value. It initializes a balance with 0 and then iterates through the list of operations, adding each operation to the balance. After iterating through operations, it checks if the balance is less than 0, and returns True if it is, indicating that the account balance fell below zero. Otherwise, it returns False, indicating that the account balance did not fall below zero.
