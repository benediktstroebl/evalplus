Here is a Python script that has a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
# Example usage
operations = [1, 2, -4, 5]
result = below_zero(operations)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

The above Python script provides a self-contained function called below_zero, which aims to solve the problem of checking whether the balance of a bank account falls below zero after processing a series of deposit and withdrawal operations. It uses a balancing operation and checks whether the balance falls below zero, and returns True in such a case, indicating the presence of an insufficient balance. The script is well-structured, with the function accepting a list of integers as input, performing the necessary calculations, and returning a boolean value indicating the result of the balance check.
