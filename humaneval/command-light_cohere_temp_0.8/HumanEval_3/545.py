```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance -= op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
``` 
This code implements the below_zero function that checks whether the balance of a bank account falls below zero after processing a list of operations. The function iterates through the individual operations in the list, updating the balance accordingly. It compares the balance with 0 at the start, and if it becomes negative, it returns True, indicating that the balance is below zero. Otherwise, it continues to iterate and returns False at the end.
