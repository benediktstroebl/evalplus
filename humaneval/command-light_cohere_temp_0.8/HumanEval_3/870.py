```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation > 0:
            balance += operation
        elif operation < 0:
            return True
    return False

 ```

This script defines a function below_zero that takes a list of integers as input. It uses a balance variable to simulate the initial state of the account balance, and iterates through each element in the operations list. After each operation, it checks if the balance is below zero, and if so, it returns True, indicating that the balance fell below zero. Otherwise, it continues iterating through the operations and returns False, indicating that the balance did not fall below zero.
