Here's the self-contained Python function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """ You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fall below zero, and
    at that point function should return True. Otherwise, it should return False.
    >>> operations
   
    balance < 0
    """

This function uses a simple conditional check to determine if the balance falls below zero. It uses the specific input validation to ensure the operations are valid.

Let's test the function with the markdown code block:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """ You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fall below zero, and
    at that point function should return True. Otherwise, it should return False.
    >>> operations = [1, 2, -4, 5]
    >>> below_zero(operations)
    True
    >>> operations = [-1, 2, -4, 5]
    >>> below_zero(operations)
    True
    >>> operations = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> below_zero(operations)
    False
    ```
