Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
    return balance < 0
```
The function below_zero takes a list of operations, and it initializes a balance variable to 0. The function then loops through each operation in the operations list, and adds the operation to the balance. The function returns True if the balance is less than 0, indicating that the account balance falls below zero.
