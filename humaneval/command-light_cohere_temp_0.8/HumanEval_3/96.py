Here's a Python script that does the job:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= operation
    return False
```
This script uses a function called `below_zero` which takes a list of operations and returns `True` if the balance falls below zero, otherwise returns `False`.  The script then provides test cases to check the correctness of the function.
