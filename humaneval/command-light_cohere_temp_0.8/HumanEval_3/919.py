Here's the solution to the markdown code block problem:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations):
    """
    Check if any operation in the list will cause the balance to go below zero.
    """
    operations: List[int].
    Returns: boolean indicating whether the balance will be below zero.
    """
example operations: [1, 2, -4, 5], returns True
    """
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
    return balance < 0
```
This script defines a function below_zero that takes a list of operations and checks if the balance will go below zero after applying all operations. 
The balance is initialized to 0 and then it iterates through each operation in the list.
