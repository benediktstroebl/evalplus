```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance -= op
    return balance < 0
``` 
The provided code is a Python script with a self-contained function called below_zero. The function takes a input as a list of integers and returns a boolean value. It initializes a balance to 0, and then iterates through each operation in the list, subtracting the operation from the balance. 

The function returns True if the balance falls below 0, indicating that the operations resulted in a negative balance, and False otherwise.
