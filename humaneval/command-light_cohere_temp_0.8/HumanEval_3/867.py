```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
``` 
This Python function below_zero takes a list of operations (List[int]) and returns a boolean value that is true if any operation in the list causes the balance of the account to go below zero, and false otherwise. The function uses a balance variable to keep track of the current balance and iterates over the operations, checking if the balance becomes negative.  If provides the constant for keeping track of the balance.
