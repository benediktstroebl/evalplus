Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance = balance + operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This function takes a list of deposit and withdrawal operations for a bank account as input, and it starts with an initial balance of 0. It then iterates through operations, updating the balance after each one. If at any point the traditional operations cause the balance to go below zero, the function returns True, indicating that the account balance has fallen below zero. Otherwise, it returns False, indicating that the balance was not below zero.
