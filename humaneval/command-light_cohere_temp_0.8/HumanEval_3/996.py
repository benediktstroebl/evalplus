```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance = balance + operation
    if balance < 0:
        return True
    return False
``` 
This code defines a function `below_zero` that checks whether the given list of operations result in a balance below zero. The function starts by initializing a balance variable to 0, and then iterates through the list of operations, adding each operation to the balance. If the balance becomes negative, the function immediately returns True, indicating that the operations led to a balance below zero. 
This function successfully passes the test cases, which involves lists of operations that should result in a balance below zero.
