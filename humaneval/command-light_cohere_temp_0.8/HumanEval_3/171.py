```Python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
    return balance < 0
```
This Python script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of integers as input and determines if any of the integers will cause the balance of a hypothetical account to go below zero. The function iterates through the all operations and calculates the balance, then it returns `True` if any of the balance becomes negative, and `False` otherwise.
