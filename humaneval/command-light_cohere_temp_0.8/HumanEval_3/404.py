```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= operation
    return False
```
This code has a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of operations and returns a boolean value that is `True` if the balance falls below zero at any point in the list and `False` otherwise. The function initializes the expected balance of zero.
