Here is a Python script that includes a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the tests provided:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```

This script defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers as input, representing deposit and withdrawal operations. It initializes a balance to 0 and then iterates over each operation in the input list. If the balance falls below zero, the function immediately returns `True`. Otherwise, it subtracts the operation from the balance and returns `False` if the balance is still non-negative, indicating that the operation did not cause the account balance to go below zero.
