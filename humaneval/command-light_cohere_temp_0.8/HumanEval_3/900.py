```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```
This function takes a list of operations and checks if the balance of the account ever falls below zero. The balance is calculated and updated as the operations are processed.
