Here's the code for the `below_zero` function:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """ Detects if the balance ever falls below zero in the operations given.
    for op in operations:
        if op < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The function iterates through the list of operations. If any operation is negative, the function immediately returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This function is designed to work with a list of operations, where the account balance starts from zero. It returns `True` if the is the case and the balance ever falls below zero. 

This self-contained function showcases a concise way to solve a specific problem, adhering to Python's principles of readability and functionality.
