Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance -= op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of integers as input and checks if any of the operations in the list would cause the balance of the account to fall below zero. The balance is initialized to 0, and the function uses a loop to go through each operation, deducting its value from the balance. The function returns `True` if any operation would cause the balance to be negative, and `False` otherwise.
