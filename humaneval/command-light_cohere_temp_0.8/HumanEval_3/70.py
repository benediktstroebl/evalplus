Here is the Python script that demonstrates the implementation of the above-zero function:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if balance < 0:
            return True
        balance -= op
    return False
```
The above-zero function takes a list of operations as an argument and iterates over the list. The function maintains a balance of the account and at each step, checks if the balance falls below zero. If the balance falls below zero, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False. 

This function is self-contained and does not require any additional imports or external functions to be called. The test cases can be added to the function to verify its correctness.
