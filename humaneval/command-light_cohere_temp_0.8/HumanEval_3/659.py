Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you described:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance -= op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This function takes a list of operations as input, where each operation is an integer indicating a deposit or withdrawal. It iterates through operations and checks if the balance of the account ever falls below zero. If it does, it returns True, indicating that the account balance has gone below zero at some point. Otherwise, it returns False, indicating that the balance has never fallen below zero.
