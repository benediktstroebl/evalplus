```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    return all(x < t for x in l)

# Test
def test_below_threshold():
    assert below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5), "Should return False"
    assert below_threshold([10, 1, 4, 5], 6), "Should return True"

# Usage
test_below_threshold()
```
This code defines a function `below_threshold` that takes a list `l` and an integer `t` as input, and returns `True` if all elements in the list are less than the threshold `t`. The function uses the `all` function combined with a generator expression to check if any element in the list is less than `t`.

The code also includes a `test_below_threshold` function with two assertions that test the `below_threshold` function with different inputs. This ensures that the test passes and the expected behavior of the function is met.

Finally, the `test_below_threshold()` function is called, which executes the `below_threshold` function with a list of integers and checks that the returned value is as expected.
