```python
def factorize(n):
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n //= 2
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, while n % i == 0:
        factors.append(i)
        n //= i
    factors.append(int(n))
    return factors

# Example test:
print(factorize(8))  # [2, 2, 2]
print(factorize(25))  # [5, 5]
print(factorize(70))  # [2, 5, 7]
```

This function is self-contained and provides a solution to the problem by finding the prime factors of a given number and returning them in order from the smallest to the largest.
