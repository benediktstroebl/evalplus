```python
def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n = n // 2
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, while n % i == 0:
        factors.append(i)
        n = n // i
    factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This function identifies and returns the list of prime factors of a given number, in descending order of their appearances in the factorization.
