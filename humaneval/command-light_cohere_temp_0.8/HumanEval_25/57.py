```python
def factorize(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return []
    
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n = n // 2
    
    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1,):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n = n // i
    
    if n > 2:
        factors.append(n)
    
    return factors
```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of prime factors of `n` in ascending order. It uses a iterative method to find the prime factors, and tests the output by checking if `n` is a prime number or not.  The function passes all the tests, including that it correctly handles the case where `n` is 1.
