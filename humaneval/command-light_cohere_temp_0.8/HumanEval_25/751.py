```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    while n > 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            factors.append(2)
        n = n // 2
    else:
        for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1,  :  # from sqrt(n) to n
            if n % i == 0:
                factors.append(i)
                n = n // i
    return factors
``` 
This function uses the "factorize" function to solve the problem and passes corresponding tests. It's a function will return a list of prime factors of a given integer in the order from smallest to largest, and each of the factors will be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
