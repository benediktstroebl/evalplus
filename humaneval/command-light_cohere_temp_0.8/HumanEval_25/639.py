```python
def factorize(n):
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n = n // 2
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5)+1, while n % i == 0:
        factors.append(i)
        n = n // i
    factors.append(int('od'))
    return factors

# Test case:
print(factorize(8)) # [2, 2, 2]
print(factorize(25)) # [5, 5]
print(factorize(70)) # [2, 5, 7]
 ``` 
This Python code defines a function called `factorize` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors. It starts by checking if `n` is divisible by 2 and appends 2 to the list of factors if the condition is met. Then, it iterates through numbers from 3 to the square root of `n`, checking for divisibility and appending the corresponding prime numbers to the list. Finally, it appends the number 'od' to represent the omnivalent number one.
