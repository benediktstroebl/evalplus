This function takes an integer n as input and returns a list of prime factors of n, ordered from smallest to largest. The function first ensures that the input is a power of 2, which makes the algorithm efficient. The function then iterates through the algorithm which, when n is not divisible by 2, adds the last factor found to the list of factors. If the number is divisible by 2, it adds the last factor found and divides n by it to find the next factor.
