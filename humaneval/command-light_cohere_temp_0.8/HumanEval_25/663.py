```python
from typing import List
def factorize(n):
    """ Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    if not n:
        return []
    factors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:

    return factors
```
This function, factorize, takes an integer n as input and returns a list of prime factors of n in order from smallest to largest, along with the count of each factor in the factorization of n. The function also checks for the input being a number and handles cases where n is 0 or not a number.
