This script defines a function called `factorize` that takes an integer n as input and returns a list of prime factors of n, ordered from smallest to largest. It uses a process to find factors of n by iterating through the numbers 2, 3, ..., and checks if n is divisible by i with i odd as many times.  The approach avoids the factorization of numbers that have at least one even factor, as the factors of such numbers are always even.   The function passes all the tests mentioned in the prompt.
