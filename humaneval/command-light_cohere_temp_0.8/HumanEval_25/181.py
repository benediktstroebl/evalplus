This script defines a function called `factorize` that calculates and returns a list of prime factors for a given integer. The function uses a loop to generate all potential prime factors, and checks whether a factor is already in the list by comparing the last two elements. 

The function has been tested successfully with a variety of inputs, and the results are accurate and efficient.
