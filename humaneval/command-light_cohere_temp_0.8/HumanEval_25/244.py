```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n //= 2
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, while n % i == 0:
        factors.append(i)
        n //= i
    factors.append(n)  # Last prime factor
    return factors
``` 
This function uses the list comprehension technique to efficiently find the prime factors of the given number, starting from the square of the number and then checking for divisibility by numbers up to the square root. The last element of the list is the final prime factor of the number, and all other elements are the factors. 

This function also has the advantage of not depending on any external functions and can be self-contained within the given script.
