```python
from typing import List
def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n = n // 2
    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1,):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n = n // i
    factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This function determines the prime factors of the provided integer n, then returns a list of those factors in ascending order, along with the number of times each factor appears in the factorization. The function handles all positive integers and handles cases where n is a prime number as well as cases where n is not a prime number.
