This script defines a function '**`factorize`**' that takes an integer '**`n`**' as input and returns a list of its prime factors. The function uses a while and a while loop, where it repeatedly divides '**`n`**' by 2 and adds the result to the list of factors if the division results in even. It also checks for other prime numbers using the formula **'**`n **‚Åµ5`** and adds the prime factor to the list of factors.
