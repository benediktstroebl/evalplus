```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    while n > 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            factors.append(2)
        n = n // 2
    else:
        for i in range(3, int(n**0.5)+1, while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n = n // i
    return factors
``` 
This Python code defines a function called `factorize` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors. The function uses a `while` loop, which iterates through the numbers 2 up to the square root of `n`, checking if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers. It then adds the loop iterates through these numbers and adds them to the `factors` list if `n` is divisible by them. The function returns the list of prime factors of `n` in the order from smallest to largest.

Here is a breakdown of the code:
- The function starts by creating an empty list called `factors` to store the prime factors of the input number `n`.
- It then enters a `while` loop, which continues until the input number `n` becomes 1.
- Inside first iteration, it checks if `n` is divisible by 2 using the modulo operator (`n % 2 == 0`). If it is, it appends 2 to the `factors` list.
- In the second iteration, it iterates through the numbers 3 to the square root of `n` (approximately `(int(n**0.5)`). It checks if `n` is divisible by `i` using the modulo operator (`n % i == 0`). If it is, it appends `i` to the `factors` list.
- After loop continues until the input number `n` becomes 1. The function returns the factors list.
