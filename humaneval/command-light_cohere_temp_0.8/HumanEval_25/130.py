This function factorsizes an input integer `n` by finding its prime factors. It starts with the by considering numbers 2 and the square numbers of integral divisors less than `n`. The function then iterates through these, and uses the sieve of Eratosthenes to efficiently skip multiples of these numbers. The function also handles the prime factors `n` and returns a list of the prime factors.
