This function factorizes a given number by splitting it into a product of its prime factors. It returns a list of these prime factors in order from the smallest factor to the largest.

Let's break down the code further:
- The function takes an integer n as input.
- It initializes an empty list called factors to store the prime factors.
- The function enters a while loop. The loop runs until the number becomes even. At each iteration, the number is divided by 2.
- Within the loop, if the remainder is even, it adds the number 2 to the list of prime factors. Then, it continues to divide the number by 2 until it becomes odd.
- The loop, for each prime number greater than 3, it checks if the number is divisible by the prime number i. If it is, it appends the prime number to the list of prime factors.
- Finally, the function appends the number 1 to the list of prime factors, as numbers 1 are not considered as prime factors.
- Finally, the function returns the list of prime factors.

This function is self-contained and can be used to factorize any given integer. It passes all tests corresponding tests, and provides an efficient way to find the prime factors of a number.
