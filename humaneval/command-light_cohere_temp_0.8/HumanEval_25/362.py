The provided Python function `factorize()` calculates and returns a list of prime factors for a given integer in a specific format. The function uses a modified version of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which is efficient and requires fewer steps compared to the original version of Sieve. The function handles the small test cases and provides a clear example to demonstrate its usage and functionality.
