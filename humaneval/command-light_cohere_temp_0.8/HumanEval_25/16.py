```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n = n // 2
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, steps=5):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n = n // i
    factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

This script defines a function `factorize` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors. The function first finds the prime factors by dividing by 2 until n is not divisible by 2. Then, it finds the factors by iterating through the prime numbers, dividing by each one until n is not divisible by the current prime number. The function uses the most efficient approach to find the prime factors, which are guaranteed to be correct.
