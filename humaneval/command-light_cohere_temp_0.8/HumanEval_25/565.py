```python
from typing import List
def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n = n // 2
    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1, step(n // i):
        factors.append(i)
    if n > 2:
            factors.append(n)
    return factors
def step(x: int) -> None:
    if x <= 1:
        return
    return step(x // 2) + step(x // 3)
```  The above Python script defines a function called `factorize` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors. The function uses a dynamic programming approach to factorize the number by dividing by 2 and its multiples until the number becomes 1.
