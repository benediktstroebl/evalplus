```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n = n // 2
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5 / 2) + 1, )):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n = n // i
    if n > 2:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code defines a function called `factorize` that calculates and returns a list of prime factors for a given integer `n`. The function works by first finding the factor of 2 (if it exists) and then iterating through other prime numbers, factoring them out as needed. The code handles cases where the large numbers efficiently by avoiding redundant computations and only factoring prime numbers.
