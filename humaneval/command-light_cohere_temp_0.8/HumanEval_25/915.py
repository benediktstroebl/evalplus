The function factors out the given number `n`. The function starts by checking if the number is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it returns an empty list. Then, it creates an empty list `factors` to store the prime factors. The function then starts a `while` loop, which iterates through all even numbers up to the square root of the number. The function then appends the number to the list `factors` if it is a prime number. The function then returns the list `factors` which contains all the prime factors of the number `n`. 

This self-contained Python function demonstrates how to factorize a given number and pass corresponding tests.
