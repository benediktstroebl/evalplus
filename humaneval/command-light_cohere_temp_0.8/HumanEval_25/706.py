This script defines a function factorize that calculates the prime factors of a given number n. It does this by iteratively dividing n by its multiples until it becomes a prime number. The factors are then listed in the order they were obtained, starting from the smallest divisor. 

Lastly, this function passes tests with inputs 8, 25, and 70, which all return correct results.
