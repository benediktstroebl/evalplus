This Python code defines a function called **factorize** that calculates and returns a list of prime factors for a given integer. The function iterates through all the factors of the number, starting from the smallest prime factor and moving towards the largest factor. The process involves checking for divisibility by 2 and progressively factoring in the largest prime number until it cannot be further divided by 2. The function then returns a list of prime factors, ordered from smallest to largest. The code also passes all these tests for the function, which demonstrate its correctness.
