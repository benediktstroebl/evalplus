```python
def factorize(n):
    if n < 2:
        return []
    
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n = n // 2
    while n > 1:
        if n % 3 == 0:
            factors.append(3)
        n = n // 3
    
    if n > 2:
        factors.append(n)
    
    return factors
```
The function `factorize` calculates and returns the list of prime factors of a given integer `n`. It uses a simple algorithm to find the prime factors and their respective counts in the factorization of `n`. 

Let's break down how the function works:
- It handles the base case where `n` is 1 or 0, returning an empty list.
- It then starts with `n` even and checks for the first odd number, which is 2.
- It then uses the progression to find subsequent odd numbers that divide `n` evenly.
- If then starts checking for the first odd number, 3. If 3 divides `n` evenly, it adds 3 to the list of factors. 
- The process continues by dividing `n` by 3 and checking for subsequent odd numbers until the next even number is reached. 
- If `n` is odd after the last even number, it is treated as a prime factor of `n`.
- The function returns the list of prime factors found.
