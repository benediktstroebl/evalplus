This Python code defines a function called `factorize` which takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of prime factors of `n` in the order of increasing magnitude. It uses a approach to determine the prime factors by first adding 1 to the list of factors, then looking for lower and higher divisors of `n` until a division is found.
