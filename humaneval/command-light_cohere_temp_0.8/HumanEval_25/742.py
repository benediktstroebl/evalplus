```python
from typing import List
def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n //= 2
    i = 3
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
        i += 2
    factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This Python code defines a function factorize that calculates and returns a list of prime factors for a given positive integer n. The function iterates through pairs of numbers (starting from 2 and increasing with square increment), checking for divisibility with n, and appending any factors that are not divisible. This effectively computes the general prime factorization for n and presents it in a list organized by decreasing factor size.
