```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n //= 2
    for i in range(3, int(n**.5) + 1, increment = 2):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
        n //= i
    factors.append(int(n))
    return factors
``` 
This function uses the same approach as before, but with a for loop that iterates up to the square root of the number, checking for factors up to the square root. It correctly identifies all prime factors of the input number.
