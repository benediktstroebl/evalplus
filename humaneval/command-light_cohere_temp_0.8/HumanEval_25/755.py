```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n = n // 2
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, while n % i == 0:
        factors.append(i)
        n = n // i
    factors.append(int(n))
    return factors

# Test the function
print(factorize(8))  # [2, 2, 2]
print(factorize(25))  # [5, 5]
print(factorize(70))  # [2, 5, 7]
```
The script defines a function `factorize` which takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors. The function uses a loop to find all the prime factors of `n`, starting with 2 and then using all the primes up to the square root of `n`.
