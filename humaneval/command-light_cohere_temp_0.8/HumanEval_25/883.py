```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n = n // 2
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1,):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n = n // i
    factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This function determines the prime factors of the provided integer in descending order, while accounting for factorization and ensuring that each factor is listed in the order of its corresponding occurrence in the factorization.
