This script defines a function called `factorize` that takes an integer n as input and returns a list of its prime factors. The function uses a `while` loop to find factors of the number until it becomes even. It then uses another loop to find all the prime factors of the number. 

The function is self-contained, and it passes all the tests. It is a efficient and effective way to solve the problem of finding prime factors in a large number.
