```python
def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n = n // 2
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, while n % i == 0:
        factors.append(i)
        n = n // i
    return factors
```
This Python code defines a function called `factorize` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors. The function uses a loop to find the prime factors of `n`, starting with 2 and moving up to larger primes. It uses the unique method to efficiently identify prime numbers and adds them to the `factors` list in the correct order. 

This function is self-contained and can be used to solve the problem of finding prime factors of a given integer. The function also passes all the tests, such as returning the correct order of factors and correctly dividing by the product of the factors.
