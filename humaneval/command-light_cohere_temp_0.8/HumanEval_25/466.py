This Python code defines a function called `factorize` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors. The function starts by checking for the existence of a factor of 2 by dividing `n` by 2 and appending it to the `factors` list. It then iterates through powers of numbers from 3 up, checking for divisibility, and if a number divides `n`, it's added to the `factors` list. The function continues until `n` is no longer divisible by any number in the range.
