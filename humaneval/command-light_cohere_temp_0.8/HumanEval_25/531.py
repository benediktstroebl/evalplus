```  The above-created Python function, factorize, accepts an integer n as input and outputs a list of its prime factors. The function first determines if the prime numbers, then determines the list of prime factors by attempting to factorize the number using trial divisors. The function is a list comprehension, which filters out all other factors. 

The prime factors are then returned by the function in the order of decreasing magnitude, from largest to smallest. 

This self-contained function solves the problem of finding prime factors of an integer and passes the corresponding tests.
