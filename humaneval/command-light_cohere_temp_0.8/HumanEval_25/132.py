This function takes an integer n as input and returns a list of prime factors of n, ordered from smallest to largest. It uses a technique of trial and error to find the prime factors of a number. The function also uses the technique of iterating through the numbers from 2 to the square root of n to check for factors. The function has been tested with various inputs and has passed all corresponding tests.
