```python
def incr_list(lst):
    """Return list with elements incremented by 1."""
    lst[:] = [lst[-1] + 1]
    return lst

# Test the function with some sample inputs/outputs
test_incr_list = lambda: [1, 2, 3] == incr_list([1, 2, 3]) and \
                [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123] == incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    assert test_incr_list()
    print("Test passed!")
```
I've encapsulated the function and included test cases to ensure its correctness. This approach adheres to the consistent coding practices and makes the function easier to comprehend and maintain.
