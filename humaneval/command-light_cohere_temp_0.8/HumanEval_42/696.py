```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    """Return list with elements incremented by 1."""
    new_list = [x + 1 for x in l]
    return new_list

# Test function to verify correctness of incr_list function
def test_incr_list():
    try:
        lst = [1, 2, 3]
        result = incr_list(lst)
        assert len(result) == 6
        assert all(result >= lst) and all(result <= lst + 1)
        return True
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return False
``` 
This code defines a function incr_list that takes a list l as input and returns a new list with elements incremented by 1. The test_incr_list function contains a try block that attempts to create a list, run the incr_list function, and assert that the resulting list has the correct content and length.
