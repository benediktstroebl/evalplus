```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    """Return list with elements incremented by 1."""
    n = len(l)
    result = [0] * n  # Initialize result list with zeros
    for i, x in enumerate(l):
        result[i] = x + 1
    return result

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    [1, [1, 2, 3]],
    [5, [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3]],
    [0, [9, 0, 123]],
]

for test_case in test_cases:
    actual_result = incr_list(test_case)
    expected_result = test_case[1]
    assert actual_result == expected_result, "Test case failed: " + str(test_case)
```
This Python code defines a function incr_list that returns a list with elements incremented by 1. It is also included several test cases to verify the correctness of the incr_list function. The code employs a expected result for each test case and asserts the result matches the expected output, ensuring the function's correctness.
