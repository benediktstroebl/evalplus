This script defines the `incr_list` function, which takes a list as input and returns a new list with elements incremented by 1. It also includes three test cases, `test_incr_list`, `test_incr_list2`, and `test_incr_list3`, which pass corresponding assertions and verify the correctness of the `incr_list` function.  The scripts pass all test cases, demonstrating the functionality of the `incr_list` function and confirming its correctness.
