```python
def incr_list(lst):
    """Return list with elements incremented by 1."""
    lst[:] = [lst[-1] + 1]
    return lst

# Test the function
def test_incr_list():
    assert incr_list([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 3, 4]
    assert incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) == [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
    assert not incr_list([]) == []
```
This code defines a function `incr_list` that takes a list as input and returns a new list with elements incremented by 1. The `test_incr_list` function tests the `incr_list` function by passing various lists and asserting that the output is correct.
