The function `incr_list` takes a list as input and returns a new list with the elements incremented by 1. It is then start with the first element of the input list and then add 1 to each subsequent element. 

You can test this function using the `test_incr_list` function with test cases that cover a variety of scenarios. 

The test cases include passing `None`, empty lists, and lists with different elements and orders.
