```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    """Return list with elements incremented by 1"""
    l.append(1)
    return l + [1]
```
We just added a single element with a value of 1 to the original list using the `append` method, and returned the result.

The updated Python script defines a function incr_list that takes a list l as input and returns a new list with elements incremented by 1. The function uses the basic Python operations to modify the input list and create the desired output.
