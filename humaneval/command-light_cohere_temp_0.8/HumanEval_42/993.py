```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    """Return list with elements incremented by 1."""
    n = len(l)
    result = [x + 1 for x in l] + [n]
    return result

# Test case 1
def test_incr_list():
    assert incr_list([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 3, 4]

# Test case 2
def test_incr_list2():
    assert incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) == [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
```
This script defines a function incr_list that adds 1 to each element in a given list and tests it with two test cases.  The test_incr_list function uses the assert statement to check if the result of calling the incr_list function with the given input list is equal to the expected output. 

This script is self-contained and provides a simple solution to the problem of incrementing elements in a list by 1.
