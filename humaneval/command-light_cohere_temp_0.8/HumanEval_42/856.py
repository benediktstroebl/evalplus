```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    """Return list with elements incremented by 1."""
    n = len(l)
    l = [i+1 for i in l]
    return l

# Test case 1
def test1():
    assert incr_list([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 3, 4]

# Test case 2
def test2():
    assert incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) == [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]

# This would cause an error before, now it passes
def test3():
    assert incr_list([-1, 2, 3]) == [0, 3, 4]
```
This Python script defines a function `incr_list` that efficiently increments a given list by 1, and includes three test cases to verify its correctness. The function takes a list as an argument and creates a new list with the same elements but incremented by 1. The test cases use the basic assert statements to check if the `incr_list` function produces the correct output for the given inputs.
