This script defines a function `incr_list` that returns a list with elements incremented by 1, and a test function `test_incr_list` that verifies if the `incr_list` function produces the correct output for a given input.  The test_incr_list` function uses the `zip` built-in function to compare the actual output with the expected output for a list of numbers. The script passes the test and the `assert` assertion is passed to check if the test was successful.
