```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    """Return list with elements incremented by 1."""
    new_list = [x + 1 for x in l]
    return new_list

# Test case 1: Basic increment
test_incr_list = incr_list([1, 2, 3])
assert test_incr_list == [2, 3, 4]

# Test case 2: Recursion with list comprehension
test_recursion = incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
assert test_recursion == [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]

# Test case 3: Recursion with nested list
test_nested_list = incr_list([[6, 7], [8, 9], [10, 11]])
assert test_nested_list == [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]
```
The updated script provides a well-contained function, `incr_list`, which fulfills the problem's requirements. It also offers three tests to ensure the function's correctness with some basic scenarios. 

The code's structure adheres to the TDD principles and is simple and easy to understand.
