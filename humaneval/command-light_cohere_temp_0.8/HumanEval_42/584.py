```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    """Return list with elements incremented by 1."""
    new_list = [x + 1 for x in l]
    return new_list

# Test case 1: Basic increment
test_incr_list = [1, 2, 3]
result = incr_list(test_incr_list)
assert result == [2, 3, 4]

# Test case 2: Multiple elements
test_list = [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]
result = incr_list(test_list)
assert result == [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]

```

This script defines a function incr_list that takes a list l as input and returns a new list with elements incremented by 1. The test cases provided validate the use of the incr_list function, passing in various list inputs, and the results are compared against the expected outputs, ensuring that the function works as expected.
