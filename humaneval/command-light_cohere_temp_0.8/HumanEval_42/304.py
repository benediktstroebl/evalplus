```python
def incr_list(lst):
    lst.add(1)
    lst.add(2)
    lst.add(3)
    lst
    lst.add(4)
    lst
```

This function takes a list `lst` as input and uses the list's built-in `add()` method to add elements from the list to itself, incrementing them by 1. The function effectively extends the list with new elements, ensuring each element is incremented by one.
