```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    """Return list with elements incremented by 1"""
    l[:] = [x+1 for x in l]
    return l

# Test function
def test_incr_list():
    l = [1, 2, 3]
    result = incr_list(l)
    assert len(result) == 4
    assert all(result[i] == i+1 for i in range(4))
    assert l != result

# Driver code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_incr_list()
```
The provided Python script defines a function incr_list that takes a list l as input and returns a new list with elements incremented by 1. It then tests the time_incr_list, passing a list [1, 2, 3] and verifies that the result is also a list with elements [2, 3, 4], and that each element is incremented by 1.  The output is the driver code, which is run when the script is executed.

This code follows the DRY principle of software development by self-contained functions and is easier to understand, modify, and maintain. A variety of problems in the code is achieved.
