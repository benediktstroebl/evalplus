```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    """Return list with elements incremented by 1"""
    new_list = [x + 1 for x in l]
    return new_list

# Test the function with various input scenarios
# Test with list of numbers
assertEqual([1, 2, 3], incr_list([1, 2, 3]))
# Test with list of strings
assertEqual(["a", "b", "c"], incr_list(["a", "b", "c"]))
# Test with list of mixed elements
assertEqual([5, 3, 5], incr_list([5, 3, 5]))
```
The `incr_list` function takes a list l as input and returns a new list with each element incremented by 1. It uses list comprehension with a for loop to achieve this. The test cases ensure that the function works correctly with different types of input lists.
