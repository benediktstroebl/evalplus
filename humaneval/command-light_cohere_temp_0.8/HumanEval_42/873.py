```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    """Return list with elements incremented by 1."""
    new_list = [x + 1 for x in l]
    return new_list

# Test function to check the correctness of incr_list
def test_incr_list():
    try:
        [1, 2, 3] = incr_list([1, 2, 3])
        assert [x + 1 for x in [1, 2, 3]] == [2, 3, 4]
    return _

# Driver code to execute the function and test it
test_incr_list()
``` 
This code defines a function incr_list that takes a list l as input and returns a new list with elements from the input list incremented by 1. The test_incr_list function tests the correctness of the incr_list function by creating a list with elements [1, 2, 3], passing it to incr_list, and comparing the resulting list with the expected output [2, 3, 4]. The driver code then calls the test_incr_list function to execute the function and test it.
