```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    """Return list with elements incremented by 1."""
    new_list = [x + 1 for x in l]
    return new_list

# Test function
def test_incr_list():
    """Return list with elements decremented by 1."""
    l = [1, 2, 3]
    result = incr_list(l)
    expected = [0, 1, 2]
    assert list(result) == expected, "Test failed: " + str(result) + " != " + str(expected)

# Driver code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_incr_list()
```

This Python script defines a function `incr_list` that adds 1 to each element of the input list, and tests it successfully with a test function `test_incr_list`.  It also ensures that the driver code, when executed, will call this function and verify the results against the expected output.
