        assert test_item == expected_item, f"Test {i+1}: failed"

    main()
```
The function `incr_list` returns a list with elements incremented by 1. The `test_incr_list` test suite ensures that the function operates as expected by comparing the output with the expected result. The `main` function is executed when the script is run directly, thereby executing the test suite and providing the expected output.
