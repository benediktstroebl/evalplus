This code defines the function fib4 that calculates the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using the recurrence relation formula. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. 

This function uses the base case to handle the edge cases of n being 0, 1, or 2, returning 0 for those cases. The else block calculates the result by summing the previous four elements from the sequence using the recurrence relation formula. 

This function is then tested with test_fib4, passing the test cases (5, 6, and 7) and verifying the output for those inputs matches the expected result.
