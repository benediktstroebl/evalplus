```python

        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    else:
        return fib4(n - 1) + fib4(n - 2) + fib4(n - 3) + fib4(n - 4)

def test_fib4():

```
This Python script defines a function called `fib4` that computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence without recursion. The `test_fib4` function contains a test case that calculates the n-th element for n = 5 and passes the test with the `assert` statement. This script effectively demonstrates the * Fibonacci sequence without recursion, and the test confirms its correctness.
