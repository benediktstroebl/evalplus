The provided code defines a Fibonacci sequence generator function, `fib4`, which uses a simple iterative approach to calculate Fibonacci numbers. It utilizes an `assert` statement to verify the function's output for specific input values. 

This script provides a self-contained way to generate and test the Fibonacci sequence using a defined function, making it more organized and readable.
