```python
def fib4(n: int):
    """The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and the next number is the sum of the previous two numbers.

    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    else:
        return fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(fib4(5))  # Output: 4
    print(fib4(6))  # Output: 8
    print(fib4(7))  # Output: 14
```
The function `fib4` computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence using an iterative approach, avoiding the pitfalls of recursion.
