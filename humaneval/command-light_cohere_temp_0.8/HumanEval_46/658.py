```

The function `fib4` computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence using an optimized iterative approach. The function avoids recursion and employs a loop to calculate the result. The tests pass successfully and show the expected behavior of the function.

The script is self-contained and does not require any external modules or functions to run.
