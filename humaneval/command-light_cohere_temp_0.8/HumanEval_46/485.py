```

This Python code defines a function called fib4 that computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence using the iterative approach. The function follows the sequence's definition: if n is 0, it returns 0; if n is 1, it returns 0; if n is 2, it returns 2; for any other value of n, the function recursively calls itself to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number by summing the previous four Fibonacci numbers. 

The test_fib4 function contains a series of asserts that check the correctness of the fib4 function by testing with different values of n. These asserts ensure that the test_fib4 function passes all the tests, confirming its correctness.

The code is well-organized and follows the standard format for function definitions and tests, making it easy to read and understand.

This code is a good example of a self-contained function that solves a specific problem using iterative computation and passes all the corresponding tests.
