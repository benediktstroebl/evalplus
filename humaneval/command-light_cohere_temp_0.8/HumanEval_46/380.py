```python
def fib4(n: int):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    else:
        return fib4(n - 1) + fib4(n - 2) + fib4(n - 3) + fib4(n - 4)

def test_fib4():
    assert fib4(5) == 4
    assert fib4(6) == 8
    assert fib4(7) == 14

The provided code is designed to calculate the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using a loop-free approach. It defines a method fib4(n), which calculates the Fibonacci number using a series of conditional statements. The base cases for n = 0, 1, and 2 are defined, returning 0, 0, and 2 respectively. The code also includes a test_fib4 function that checks the correctness of the fib4 function by passing different values of n and asserting that the calculated result matches the expected output.
