This code defines a function called fib4 that computes the nth Fibonacci number using the iterative method. It also contains a test_fib4() function, which verifies the correctness of the fib4 function using various input values. The script passes all the test cases successfully, demonstrating that the fib4 function produces the correct Fibonacci numbers.
