Here's a self-contained Python function that computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence using the iterative method, without recursion:
```python
def fib4(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    else:
        return fib4(n - 1) + fib4(n - 2)

```

This function uses an iterative approach to calculate the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence, avoiding recursion altogether. It utilizes a useful for avoiding excessive function call stack for large inputs.
