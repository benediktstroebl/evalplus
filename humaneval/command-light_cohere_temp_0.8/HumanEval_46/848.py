Here is the Python code with a self-contained function that solves the Fibonacci sequence problem:
```python
def fib4(n: int):
    """The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
    fib4 = [0, 1]
    while n > 0:
        fib[n] = fib[n-1] + fib[n-2]
        n -= 1
    return fib

def test_fib4():
    n = 7
    assert fib4(n) == fib[n] == 14

print("All tests passed!")
```

The code defines a function called `fib4` that computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence using a loop. It uses a an simple formula to calculate each number, and the sequence is initialized with [0,1]. The function then tests its own output by calling it with the value 7 and checking that the result is indeed 14, which is the 7th element in the Fibonacci sequence. Finally, it prints a "All tests passed" message.
