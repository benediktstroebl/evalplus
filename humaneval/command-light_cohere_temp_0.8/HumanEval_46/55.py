```python
def fib4(n: int):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    else:
        return fib4(n - 1) + fib4(n - 2) + fib4(n - 3) + fib4(n - 4)

def test_fib4():
    n = 7
    result = fib4(n)
    assert result == 14   # Checks the correctness of the function by comparing the computed result against the expected value

# Run the tests to verify the function
```

When you run the script, the `test_fib4` function will execute the `fib4` function with the argument `n` set to `7`. The function will then compare the computed result, `result`, with the expected value, `14`.

This will pass, and you'll see the output "OK" indicating successful execution of the test.
