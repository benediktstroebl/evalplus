The provided Python script defines a function called fib4 that computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence without recursion. The function uses a combination of a base case and a recursive call to calculate the Fibonacci number. 

The test_fib4 function contains a set of test cases that validate the correctness of the fib4 function using various input values. The script also includes a main function, which serves as the entry point for the script. 

The code is well-structured and follows good practices. It efficiently calculates Fibonacci numbers without recursion, which is a common technique in solving such problems. 

Note: The code uses the assert statement to validate the results of the fib4 function, and the assert_equals function to check if two variables are equal.
