The Fibonacci sequence is a famous sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence begins with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The Fibonacci sequence has many applications in mathematics, computer science, and other fields.

In this code, we have defined a function called `fib4()` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the n-th Fibonacci number in the sequence. We have used a process through a simple case for the first few numbers: if `n` is 0 or 1, the function returns 0. If `n` is 2, the function returns 2. If `n` is 3, the function returns 0. If `n` is 4, the function returns the sum of the previous three numbers: `fib4(n - 1) + fib4(n - 2) + fib4(n - 3) + fib4(n - 4)`.

The Fibonacci sequence is a well-known mathematical sequence that has been studied for centuries. It is a sequence that is defined by the sum of the two preceding numbers in the sequence.

The Fibonacci sequence is also known for its properties and relationships. It has been used to solve many problems in mathematics and computer science, and has also been used to create many algorithms and data structures.

This code defines a function that efficiently computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence without recursion. It is a use of a simple case for the first few numbers and the `fib4()` function to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number in the sequence.
