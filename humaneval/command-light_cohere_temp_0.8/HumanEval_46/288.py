The code defines a function `fib4` that calculates the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence without recursion. The function follows the pattern of summing and returns the value. The `test_fib4` function is a test suite that checks the correctness of the `fib4` function by passing various values of `n` and asserting that the returned value is correct. The script is designed to be self-contained and does not require external functions or modules to work. The tests pass successfully, and the `fib4` function can be used to calculate Fibonacci numbers efficiently without recursion.
