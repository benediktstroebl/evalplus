The code defines a Fibonacci sequence function `fib4` using a simple iterative approach. It then includes unit tests to ensure the function's correctness. Finally, the code runs the tests using `test_fib4()` and prints the results.

This code provides a self-contained solution and test for the Fibonacci sequence problem.
