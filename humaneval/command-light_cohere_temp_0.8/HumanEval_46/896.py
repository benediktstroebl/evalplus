```
This code defines a Python function called fib4, which computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence. The function follows the pattern of calculating the nth element using the recurrence relation of the Fibonacci sequence, which is a mathematical formula. The function then uses the Python test library (pytest) to perform unit tests on the correctness of the function. The tests include checking the Fibonacci sequence values up to 7, and verify that the function produces the correct results.

The function is designed to be efficient and not use any recursive calls, which means it will run quickly and produce the correct Fibonacci sequence element without any unnecessary computations. 

This is a self-contained solution that can be used to compute Fibonacci sequence elements in a variety of situations. The function can be easily imported and used in other Python scripts, or it can be called directly from the script above.
