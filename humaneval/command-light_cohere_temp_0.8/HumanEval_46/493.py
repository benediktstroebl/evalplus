The `fib4` function computes the n-th Fibonacci number using the formula `fib4(n) = fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)`. The `test_fib4` function contains a series of tests that check the correctness of the `fib4` function for various input values. The `assert_interfaces` function is a helper function that asserts the `interface` argument is a valid interface type. 
When the script is run, it will run the test suite and display the results. The test suite includes a series of test cases that validate the correctness of the `fib4` function.
