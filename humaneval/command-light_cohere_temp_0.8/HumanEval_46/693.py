```
The provided code defines a function `fib4` that computes the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using a method that does not use recursion. The function uses a `assert` statements to test its functionality, which passes all the tests. The code is functional and efficient and does not rely on recursion, which can be slower and require more memory.
