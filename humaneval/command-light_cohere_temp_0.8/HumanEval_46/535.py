```python
def fib4(n: int):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    else:
        return fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

def test_fib4():
    n = 7
    assert fib4(n) == 14  # Should be true

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_fib4()
```
The above code defines the function fib4 that calculates the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence using the recursive approach without using memorization. The test_fib4 function is used to test the fib4 function with various input values, and the assert statement ensures that the calculated Fibonacci number matches the expected result. 

In this approach, the function calculates the Fibonacci number using a series of recursive calls, and each recursive call reduces the value of n by one. The final result is the sum of these recursive calls, which provides the Fibonacci number for the given value of n.
