```python
def fib4(n: int):
    """The Fibonacci sequence without recursion.
    fib_sequence = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0]
    return fib_sequence[n]

# Test case
test_fib = {
    assert fib4(5) == 4
    assert fib4(6) == 8
    assert fib4(7) == 14
})
```
This script defines a function called fib4 that calculates the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence without recursion. It uses an array of numbers [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0] which are the initial values of the Fibonacci sequence and returns the nth element from this array based on the index n.

Additionally, the script provides a test case with assertions that validate the correctness of the fib4 function by checking its output against the expected values for specific input values. 

This approach eliminates the need for additional variables and calls to other functions, making the code self-contained and more concise.
