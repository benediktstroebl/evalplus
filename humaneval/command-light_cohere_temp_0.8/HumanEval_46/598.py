    elif n < 2:

``` 
The code defines a function `fib4` that computes the nth Fibonacci number in O(1) using the formula `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`. The test function `test_fibonacci` is then used to check the correctness of the `fib4` function. The script also includes a main function where the `test_fibonacci` function is called with an argument of `n = 7`, which is the seventh Fibonacci number. 

This self-contained Python script demonstrates how to efficiently compute Fibonacci numbers without recursion and passes corresponding tests.
