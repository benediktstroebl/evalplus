This Python script defines the `fib4` function which calculates the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using the provided formula. The function checks for valid input and returns the appropriate value. The `test_fib4` function contains unit tests to ensure the `fib4` function behaves correctly for various inputs. The script can be executed to run the code and verify the function's correctness.
