The Python code defines the `fib4` function that computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence using an optimized approach. It achieves this by recursively building the sequence based on the rules: `fib4(0) -> 0`, `fib4(1) -> 0`, `fib4(2) -> 2`, and `fib4(3) -> 0`. The function handles any input `n` value by returning the sum of the preceding four elements of the sequence, which are the basic building blocks for the Fibonacci sequence. 

The `test_fib4` function tests the `fib4` function by asserting that the result of the function call with various input values is correct. The test function verifies that the expected behavior of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring the `fib4` function produces the correct results.
