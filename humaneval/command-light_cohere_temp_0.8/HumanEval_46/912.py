```python
def fib4(n: int):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    else:
        return fib4(n - 1) + fib4(n - 2) + fib4(n - 3) + fib4(n - 4)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(fib4(5))  # Output: 4
    print(fib4(6))  # Output: 8
    print(fib4(7))  # Output: 14
```
This code defines a `fib4` function that computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence without using recursion. The function uses a specific conditions to identify the base cases (0, 1, and 2) and returns the corresponding values. For inputs greater than n, the function recursively calculates the sum of the previous four numbers in the sequence, which follows the definition of Fibonacci numbers.

This code is designed to be efficient and avoid the use of recursion, which can be slower due to function call overhead. Instead, it uses a specific formula and a loop to compute the Fibonacci numbers. The code is self-contained and does not rely on any external functions or modules.
