This code defines a function `fib4` that computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence using a technique that avoids recursion. The function uses a series of conditional checks to determine the Fibonacci value and returns the result. It also includes a series of unit tests using `pytest` to verify the correctness of the `fib4` function. The output of these tests will print the function's behavior for different inputs.
