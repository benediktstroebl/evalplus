```python
def fib4(n: int):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    else:
        return fib4(n - 1) + fib4(n - 2) + fib4(n - 3) + fib4(n - 4)

def test_fib4():
    assert fib4(5) == 4
    assert fib4(6) == 8
    assert fib4(7) == 14
```

The function `fib4` calculates the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence without recursion. It uses a pattern of `if-else` statements to check for base cases and then uses the previously computed values to compute the next numbers in the sequence. The test_fib4 function tests the function by asserting that its output for different inputs matches the expected results.
