The provided Python code defines a Fibonacci sequence function using a specific formula and tests its correctness with various input values. It employs a mathematical definition of the Fibonacci sequence and provides a clear separation between the function definition and the test code. The test suite covers a range of input values and ensures the correctness of the Fibonacci function's behavior across different scenarios. This code follows PEP 803 and adheres to clear and concise function and variable names, which enhance the readability and maintainability of the code.
