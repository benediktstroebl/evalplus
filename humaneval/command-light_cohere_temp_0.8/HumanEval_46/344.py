This Python code defines a function called `fib4` that computes the n-th Fibonacci number using a dynamic programming approach. It uses an if-else structure to check for base cases (n = 0, 1, 2), and then recursively computes the Fibonacci number for other values of n by summing intermediate terms. The `test_fib4` function tests the `fib4` function with various input values and asserts that the results are correct. The code employs a:
- A dynamic programming approach to computing Fibonacci numbers, which is more efficient than recursion.
- A test suite that ensures the correctness of the `fib4` function.
- Clear documentation and comments that explain the purpose, usage, and behavior of the functions.
- Proper function naming and formatting that adhere to Python conventions, make the code readable and maintainable.

These practices enhance the code's understandability, maintainability, and reliability.
