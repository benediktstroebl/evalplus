```python
def fib4(n: int):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    else:
        return fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

def test_fib4():
    assert fib4(5) == 4
    assert fib4(6) == 8
    assert fib4(7) == 14

# Main function to execute the above function and tests
def fib4_main():
    test_fib4()

# Main execution of the program
fib4_main()()
```
The provided Python code defines a function called `fib4` that computes the n-th Fibonacci number using a mathematical formula. The function is implemented without recursion, relying on a specific formula to achieve the desired result. 

The `test_fib4` function is used to validate the `fib4` function's output for various input values. The `fib4_main` function serves as the entry point, orchestrating the execution of the `fib4` function and associated tests. 

This self-contained approach efficiently computes Fibonacci numbers and offers a straightforward and organized solution for the problem.
