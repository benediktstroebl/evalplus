Here's the code to solve the Fibonacci sequence problem without using recursion:
```python
def fib4(n: int):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    else:
        return fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

```
This code defines a Python function called `fib4` that calculates the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence without using recursion. The function uses a specific conditions to determine the base cases for the sequence (where n is 0, 1, or 2), and then uses an iterative approach to calculate the next numbers in the sequence by summing the previous three Fibonacci numbers. This approach avoids the   the recursive function calls, making it more efficient and avoiding excessive function call stacks.
