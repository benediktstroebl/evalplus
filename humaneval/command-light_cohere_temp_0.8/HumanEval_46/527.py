```

The `fib4` function calculates the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using the mathematical definition. It uses a the `test_fib4` function to test the function with different inputs and verify that the output is correct. The code is organized and efficient, and it provides a self-contained solution to the problem.

Note: You can modify the `test_fib4` function and add more test cases to cover various scenarios.
