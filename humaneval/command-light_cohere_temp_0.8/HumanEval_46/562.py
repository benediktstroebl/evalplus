```python
def fib4(n: int):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    else:
        return fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(fib4(5))
    print(fib4(6))
    print(fib4(7))
```

This Python script defines a function called `fib4` that computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence using a formula-based approach instead of recursion. The function returns the basic cases of 0, 1, and 2, and uses the provided formula for Fibonacci numbers to calculate subsequent terms when n is greater than 2. The script includes a test case that checks the function's output against the values of the 5th element of the Fibonacci sequence. The test case verifies that the function correctly computes the n-th Fibonacci number.
