The provided Python script defines a function called `fib4` that calculates the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using an iterative approach. It adheres to the well-known definition of the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The test cases at the have been added to demonstrate the functionality of the `fib4` function, which successfully computes the 7th element of the Fibonacci sequence.
