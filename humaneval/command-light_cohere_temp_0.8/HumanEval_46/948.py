    elif n == 1:

    try:
        assert fib4(5) == 4
        assert fib4(6) == 8
        assert fib4(7) == 14
        assert fib4(8) == 26

test_fib4()
```
The Python script provided defines a function `fib4` that computes the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using a loop-based approach. 

The `test_fib4` function contains assertions that check the correctness of the `fib4` function by testing its output against the expected results for specific inputs. 

This self-contained solution demonstrates the computation of Fibonacci numbers without relying on recursive calls.
