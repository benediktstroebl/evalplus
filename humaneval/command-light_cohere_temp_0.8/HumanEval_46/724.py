This code defines a function called fib4 that computes the n-th Fibonacci number using a simple formula. The function returns the the previous two terms of the sequence without the current number. The test function tests the result of the fib4 function, and asserts that the function's output matches the expected output. The code will be run, and the test will pass successfully.
