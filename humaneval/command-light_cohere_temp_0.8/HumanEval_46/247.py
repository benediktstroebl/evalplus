```python
def fib4(n: int):
    """The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers.

    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    else:
        return fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

```

The code above defines a function called `fib4` that computes the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using a formula-based approach. The function handles the` `n` as input, and returns the corresponding Fibonacci number. The code is written in a way that it can be easily executed and run without requiring any additional code or external libraries.
