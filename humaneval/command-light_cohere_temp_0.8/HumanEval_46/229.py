```
The provided code demonstrates the definition of a function called `fib4` that computes the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using a technique that avoids recursion. The function achieves this result by utilizing a conditional chain of if-elif statements, where each condition checks for specific values of `n` and returns the corresponding Fibonacci value. The test function `test_fib4` verifies the correctness of the `fib4` function by asserting that its output values match the expected results for specific input values.

This code is self-contained and does not require external dependencies to function correctly.
