This code implements a function called fib4 that computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1 and then each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The function uses a recursion to compute the Fibonacci numbers. The tests pass the example values to the function and print the results, which match the expected outputs.
