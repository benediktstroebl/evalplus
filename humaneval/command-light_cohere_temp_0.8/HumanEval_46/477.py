The provided Python script defines a function called fib4 which computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence without recursion. The function uses a basic if-else statement to handle different cases of the input n: it returns 0 if n is 0, 1 if n is 1, and 2 if n is 2. If n is greater than 3, the function recursively calls itself with the input (n-1) and (n-2) and then adds the results together to get the n-th Fibonacci number. The test function test_fib4 is a test function that calls fib4 with various input values and asserts that the returned values are correct. The test function passes all the test, demonstrating that the fib4 function works as expected.
