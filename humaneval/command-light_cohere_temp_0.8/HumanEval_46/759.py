The code provided is a Python script that defines a function called `fib4` which computes the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a mathematical sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The code also provides a `test_fib4` function that prompts the user to enter a number and then prints out the corresponding Fibonacci number. The code is self-contained and does not use recursion.
