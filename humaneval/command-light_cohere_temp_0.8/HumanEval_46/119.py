This code defines a function called `fib4` that computes the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using a loop-based approach. The function first checks if the input `n` is less than or equal to 0, in which case it returns 0. If `n` is greater than 0, the function recursively calls itself to compute the Fibonacci value of `n-1` and then adds the Fibonacci values of `(n-2)` and `(n-3)` to get the Fibonacci value of `(n-4)`.

The function is then tested using the `test_fib4` function, which asserts that the function works correctly for various input values.

Finally, the `test_fib4()` function is called to run the tests. The function passes all the tests successfully, and it can be used to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently.
