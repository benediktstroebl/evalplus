The function **fib4** calculates the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence using a loop. It returns the value of n. The function then the code structure ensures readability and makes it easier to understand the logic and structure of the code.

The test_fib4 function contains several test cases that verify the function's correctness. The test_fib4 function uses assertions to check if the function **fib4** returns the expected values for the given input. If any assertion fails, an error is raised, and the error message provides information about which test case failed.

This Python script efficiently computes Fibonacci numbers without using recursion, making it more memory-efficient and faster. It demonstrates a concept of self-containment, which is an important programming principle that allows code to be written and maintained without relying on external functions or modules.
