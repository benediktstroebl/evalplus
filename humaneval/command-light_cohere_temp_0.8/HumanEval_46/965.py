```
The function `fib4` takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the nth Fibonacci number in the Fibonacci sequence. The function uses an iterative approach to calculate the Fibonacci number, where it iterates from 0 to `n-2` using a loop and updates the values of `a` and `b` using the addition of the last two values. 
In each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` are updated using the addition of the previous values.  The function then returns the value of `b`, which represents the nth Fibonacci number in the sequence.
