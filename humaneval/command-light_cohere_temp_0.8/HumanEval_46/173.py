This Python code defines a function called `fib4` that computes the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using an efficient approach that avoids recursion. The `test_fibonacci` function serves as a test driver, ensuring that the `fib4` function produces the correct results for different input values. 

The `__main__` block concludes by running the test driver function with a higher input value, demonstrating the function's correctness and efficiency.
