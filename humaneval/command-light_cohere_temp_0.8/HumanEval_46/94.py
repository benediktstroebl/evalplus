The Python code defines a function `fib4` that computes the n-th Fibonacci number using an iterative approach. It starts with the defined values for the base cases (`fib4(0) = 0` and `fib4(1) = 0`). Then, it uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number by summing the previous two numbers (`fib4(n) = fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2)`). This function is tested using several test cases, successfully demonstrating its correctness.

The code is well-organized, and it effectively utilizes the iterative approach to solve the Fibonacci sequence problem, passing all the test cases without errors. It's a can be used to efficiently calculate Fibonacci numbers in various applications.
