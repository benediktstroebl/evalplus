The provided code defines a Python function called fib4 that computes the n-th value of the Fibonacci sequence using the iterative method. It implements a test and asserts its correctness against the expected results for the given inputs. The function uses a concept of memoization, which involves storing previously computed values to avoid redundant calculations. The test_fib4 function validates the correctness of the fib4 function using asserts. The main function is the entry point of the script and runs the test_fib4 function to check the correctness of the Fibonacci sequence calculation.
