Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the Fibonacci sequence problem:
```python
def fib4(n: int):
    """The Fibonacci sequence problem, implemented without recursion.
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    else:
        return fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)
```
The function uses a loop to compute the n-th Fibonacci number in O(n) time complexity.
