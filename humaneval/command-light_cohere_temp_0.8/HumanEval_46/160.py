# Example usage

```
The provided Python script defines a function `fib4` that computes the n-th Fibonacci number in O(1) using an efficient method that does not rely on recursion. The function follows the optimized algorithm provided by Binet and Van Menger's Theorem (BvM). The function then passes unit tests to ensure its correctness. In the example usage section, the `test_fib4` function is called to execute these tests.

The code provides a simple and efficient solution for computing Fibonacci numbers without recursion, which can be useful in various applications involving Fibonacci sequences.
