This code defines a function called fib4 that computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence without recursion. It uses a certain logic to compute the sequence:
1. The function first checks if the input n is less than or equal to 0. If true, it returns 0.
2. If the input is 1, it returns 0 (base case for a single element).
3. If the input is 2, it returns 1 (base case for a single element).
4. If the input is 3, it returns 1 (base case for a single element).
5. If the input is 4, it returns 2 (base case for a single element).
6. If the input n is greater than 5, it calls itself recursively with the argument (n - 1) and then adds the results of the previous two recursive calls. 

This function is then tested with the test_fib4 function, which asserts that all the calls to fib4 with different input values return the expected results.
