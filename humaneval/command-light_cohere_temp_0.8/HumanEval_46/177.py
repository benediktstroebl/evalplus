```python
def fib4(n: int):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    else:
        return fib4(n - 1) + fib4(n - 2) + fib4(n - 3) + fib4(n - 4)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Fibonacci numbers:")
    for i in range(0, 10):
        print(fib4(i), end=' ')
``` 
This Python code defines a Fibonacci sequence, similar to the classic Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. This sequence follows a pattern with each number calculated as a sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. 
The code then defines a function fib4 that calculates the nth Fibonacci number in the sequence. 
The function uses a simple if-elif structure to determine which Fibonacci number to calculate based on the value of n. 
The function then uses recursion to calculate the Fibonacci number for n = 0, n = 1, and n = 2. 
Finally, the code runs a series of tests to print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.
