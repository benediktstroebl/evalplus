The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The Fibonacci sequence is closely related to the golden ratio and is often used in various mathematical and scientific applications. The code provided above is a Python function that computes the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using a simple iterative approach. It avoids recursion and provides an efficient and straightforward solution.
