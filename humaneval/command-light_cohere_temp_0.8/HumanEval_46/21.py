The code defines a Python function `fib4` that computes the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using an optimized method. It then tests this assert statements to ensure the function's correctness. The code is organized into a clear structure with comments explaining each section's purpose.

This Python code is designed to compute the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using a loop-based approach instead of recursion. The function `fib4` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the corresponding Fibonacci number. The tests `test_fib4` verify the function's correctness by checking if `fib4` returns the expected values for specific inputs. The code is also designed to handle potential division-by-zero errors using `assert_raises`.
