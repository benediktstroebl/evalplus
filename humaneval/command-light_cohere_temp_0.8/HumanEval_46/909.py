This code implements a function called fib4 that calculates the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using a recursive approach. The function takes an integer n as input and returns the corresponding Fibonacci number. The function utilizes a simple logic to check the base cases (n==0, n==1, n==2) and then recursively calls itself to calculate the next number by summing the previous two numbers. The function is self-contained and does not rely on any external functions or modules.
