# Example usage:
print("The nth Fibonacci number for n = 5 is: " + fibonacci(5)")
``` 
The code defines a function called `fib4` that calculates the nth Fibonacci number in an efficient manner without using recursion. The `test_fibonacci` function tests the `fib4` function with various input values and asserts that the results are correct. The example usage demonstrates the output of the function with a specific value of n.

The code is well-organized, and the function and tests are self-contained, which is essential for maintainability and reliability in larger codebases.
