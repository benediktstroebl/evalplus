``` 
The script defines the function fib4 that computes the n-th Fibonacci number using a non-recursive approach. The test_fib4 function tests the function by taking user input for n and verifying if the computed Fibonacci number matches the value returned by the fib4 function. The test loop runs five times, and the results are printed.
