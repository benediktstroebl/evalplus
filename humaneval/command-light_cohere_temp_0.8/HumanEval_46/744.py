        return 0
    else:
        return fib4(n - 1) + fib4(n - 2) + fib4(n - 3) + fib4(n - 4)

This code defines a function called `fib4` which computes the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using the recursive definition. The function returns the The base cases (n=0, 1) return 0, and for n=2 it returns 2. For larger n values, the function recursively calls itself and sums the previous four Fibonacci numbers. The tests ensure that function works correctly for the specified range of input.

This code is self-contained, and does not require any additional functions or modules. It is a way to solve the Fibonacci sequence problem.
