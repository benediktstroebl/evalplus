```
The Fibonacci sequence 4 is a sequence that's similar to the Fibonacci sequence, except that each element is the sum of the four preceding elements. The function computes the particular sequence using a mathematical approach that does not rely on recursion, which makes it more efficient and reliable than other standard recursive approaches. The tests verify that correctness of the function.
