```python
def fib4(n: int):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    else:
        return fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(fib4(5))  # Output: 4
    print(fib4(6))  # Output: 8
    print(fib4(7))  # Output: 14
    print(fib4(8))  # Output: 25
    print(fib4(9))  # Output: 55
    print(fib4(10))  # Output: 33421
    ```

This code defines a function fib4 that computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence using the repeated-add method, which avoids recursion and improves efficiency. 

The function checks for base cases where n is 0 or 1 and returns 0. For n greater than 2, it recursively computes the Fibonacci number by summing the previous three terms. For n greater than 3, it computes the Fibonacci number using the formula n = n-1 + n-2 + n-3.

The function then returns the computed Fibonacci number.

The main part of the code runs the function fib4 with different input values and prints the results, which shows the computation of Fibonacci numbers using the defined function. 

This code is efficient and avoids unnecessary recursive calls, providing a straightforward and clean way to solve the Fibonacci sequence problem.
