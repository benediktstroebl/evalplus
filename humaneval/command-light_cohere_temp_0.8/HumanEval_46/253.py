```python

        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    else:
        return fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

```
This code defines a function `fib4` that computes the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using the given formula. The function has a test_fib4 function, which passes assertions to check if the function's output is correct for the given input values. 
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence begins with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. The sequence continues indefinitely, with each new number being the sum of the two preceding ones. The Fibonacci sequence is a popular mathematical sequence that has many applications in computer science, mathematics, and other fields.
