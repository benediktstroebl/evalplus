```
The code defines the Fibonacci sequence using the Fibonacci sequence formula. The n-th element of the sequence is computed using a simple loop that recursively calculates the sum of the previous four elements. The code also includes a test suite with test cases to verify the correctness of the `fib4` function. The test suite passes all test cases, indicating that the function is working as expected.
