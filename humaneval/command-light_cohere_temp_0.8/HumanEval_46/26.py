```python
def fib4(n: int):
    """The Fibonacci sequence without recursion. 
    a = [0, 1]
    b = [0] * (n - 1) 
    for _ in range(n): 
        a, b = b, a + b[()-1] 
    return b

# Test the function
test_fib4 = fib4
test_fib4(7)
print(test_fib4)

```
This Python code defines a function fib4 that calculates the Fibonacci sequence without recursion. The function initializes two arrays, a and b, where a holds the current Fibonacci value and b holds the values of the previous four Fibonacci numbers. Then, it uses a for loop to iterate up to the given n, updating a and b values accordingly. Finally, it returns the value of b, which holds the nth Fibonacci number in the sequence.

This code is designed to efficiently calculate Fibonacci numbers without using recursion, which can be slower and resource-intensive. The function is straightforward and easy to understand, making it a clean and readable way to implement the Fibonacci sequence in Python.
