```
The Python code provided defines a function called fib4 that computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence. It uses a basic control flow and does not use recursion. 

The code then defines a series of tests for the function fib4. It ensures that the function correctly computes the Fibonacci numbers and passes all the test cases. 

Note that the code is self-contained and does not require any additional functions or external dependencies.
