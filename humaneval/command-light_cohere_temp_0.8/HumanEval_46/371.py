        return fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

    try:
        assert fib4(5) == 4

```
The code defines a Fibonacci sequence generator function called fib4, which uses an iterative approach instead of recursion to calculate the nth element of the sequence. It also includes a test_fib4 function with test cases and assert statements to verify the correctness of the fib4 function's output for different input values. The code successfully passes all tests, demonstrating that the fib4 function produces the correct Fibonacci sequence values.
