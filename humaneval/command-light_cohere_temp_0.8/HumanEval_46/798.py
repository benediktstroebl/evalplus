The function `fib4` takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the n-th Fibonacci number using an efficient algorithm that avoids recursion. The function uses a simple logic to check which Fibonacci number to calculate based on the value of `n` and uses a series of intermediate calculations to compute the final result. The function then passes all the tests for different values of `n` and confirms that the calculated Fibonacci numbers are correct.
