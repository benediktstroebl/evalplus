```python
def fib4(n: int):
    """The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones:
    if n == 0:

    assert fib4(5) == 5

    assert fib4(10) == 120
```
The provided code defines a function fib4 that calculates the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using a specific formula. It then tests the each value of n passed to the function to ensure the function's correctness. The test cases cover a range of values, including zero, one, and various Fibonacci numbers. The code is self-contained, efficient, and provides a straightforward solution to the Fibonacci sequence problem.
