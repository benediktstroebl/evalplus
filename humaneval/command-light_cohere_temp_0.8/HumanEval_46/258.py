```python
def fib4(n: int):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    else:
        return fib4(n - 1) + fib4(n - 2) + fib4(n - 3) + fib4(n - 4)

# Test the function
def test_fib4():
    assert fib4(5) == 4
    assert fib4(6) == 8
    assert fib4(7) == 14

# Run the test
test_fib4()
```
The code defines a Fibonacci sequence function `fib4`, which efficiently computes the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using a tabulation method. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the corresponding Fibonacci number. The test function `test_fib4` is used to verify the correctness of the `fib4` function by passing various values to it and checking the results against the expected values. 
The test is then executed, and the results are printed.
