The code defines the Fibonacci sequence formula and computes the nth number in the sequence for a given value of n. The test_fib4 function tests the fib4 function with different input values and ensures the correctness of the function's output. 

Please note that you can use this code to calculate Fibonacci numbers efficiently without using recursion, which may lead to less complex and more optimized code.
