The code above defines a function called fib4 which computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence. The function uses a 5-step approach and does not use recursion. The tests that are in the test_fib4 function, and pass the corresponding checks. The main driver code is in the if __name__ == "__main__": block, and runs the tests when the script is executed.
