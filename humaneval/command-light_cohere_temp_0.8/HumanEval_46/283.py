```python
def fib4(n: int):
    """The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which the next number is equal to the sum of the two preceding ones. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers.

    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    else:
        return fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2)

```

This Python code defines a function called fib4 that computes the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using a specific mathematical formula. It uses a analytical approach without recursion, which may result in more efficient computation for large n values.
