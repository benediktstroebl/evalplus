The code defines a function called fib4, which computes the n-th Fibonacci number using a technique that avoids recursion, which is more efficient and avoids stack overflow problems. The function returns the tested using the assert statements to ensure that the function produces the correct results for various input values. The tests pass successfully, confirming the correctness of the fib4 function.
