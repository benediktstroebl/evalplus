```python
def fib4(n: int):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    else:
        return fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

def test_fib4():
    assert fib4(5) == 4
    assert fib4(6) == 8
    assert fib4(7) == 14
    assert fib4(8) == 26
    assert fib4(9) == 84

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_fib4()
```
The code defines a function fib4 that calculates the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence without recursion. It employs an iterative approach using a conditional stack to determine the sequence.

The test_fib4 function includes a series of tests that verify the correctness of the fib4 function. The tests input various values and assert that the calculated Fibonacci numbers match the expected results. The code is well-structured and efficient, using a simple and straightforward formula to generate Fibonacci numbers.
