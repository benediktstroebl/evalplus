This script defines a function called fib4 that calculates the n-th Fibonacci number using an iterative approach. The function takes an integer n as input and returns the corresponding Fibonacci number. The test_fib4 function then checks the correctness of the fib4 function by verifying that its output matches the expected results for the given inputs. 

This script is self-contained and does not rely on any external functions or modules.
