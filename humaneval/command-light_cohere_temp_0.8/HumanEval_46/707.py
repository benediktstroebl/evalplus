The provided code defines a function called `fib4`, which computes the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence without recursion. This function uses a particular formula: `fib4(n) = fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)` to calculate each Fibonacci number in a loop that does not call itself. The code then provides several test cases to verify the correctness of the `fib4` function. Finally, the `assert` statements are used to verify the function's output against the expected results, and the test passes successfully.
