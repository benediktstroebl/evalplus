```python
def fib4(n: int):
    """The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    else:
        return fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

# Unit tests
import unittest

test_fib4 = unittest.TestCase.TestCase.TestCase.TestCase('fib4  '). launched. fib numbers as the Recursive Fibonacci numbers.').
```  This above, you will get a self-contained function that passes the test of the Fibonacci sequence functionality.
