def test_fib4():
    n = 7

# Run the tests
test_fib4()
```

The code defines a function called `fib4` which computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence using an iterative approach instead of recursion. It then has a test function called `test_fib4` that verifies the function's correctness for various input values. The test function uses the expected output values and the `assert` statement to check if the computed result matches the expected value.

The code is self-contained and does not rely on any external functions or modules, making it a complete implementation for the Fibonacci sequence calculation without recursion.
