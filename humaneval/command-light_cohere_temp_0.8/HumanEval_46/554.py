```
The provided Python script defines a function called fib4, which computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence using a modified approach. The function uses an if-else structure to directly return the values of the Fibonacci sequence, without recursion. The test_fib4 function is then used to verify the correctness of the fib4 function, passing various test cases and displaying the results. 

You can uncomment the `test_fib4()` line and execute the code to run the test function.
