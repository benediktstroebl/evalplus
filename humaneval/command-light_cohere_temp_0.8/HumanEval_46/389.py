This Python code defines a function called `fib4` that computes the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using a mathematical formula. The function implements the approach by recursively computing the sequence, avoiding the use of excessive recursive calls and manual summing. The tests `test_fib4` verify the function's correctness by checking if the result of `fib4` for specific input values is correct. 

This code provides a simple, efficient, and self-contained solution to the Fibonacci sequence problem without relying on external libraries or excessive computation.
