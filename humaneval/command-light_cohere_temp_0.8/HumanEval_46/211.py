The function `fib4` is a recursive function that computes the n-th Fibonacci number using a recurrence relation. It follows the specific formula for computing the Fibonacci numbers, and the test function `test_fib4` is used to verify the correctness of the function by passing various values of `n`. The test passes successfully, indicating that the function works correctly.
