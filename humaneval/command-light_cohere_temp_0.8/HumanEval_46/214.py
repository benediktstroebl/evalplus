The provided Python script defines a function `fib4` that generates the Fibonacci sequence using a specified range given by `n`. The function then returns the n-th element of the sequence based on the input `n`. The sequence starts with 0, and the subsequent numbers are obtained by summing the preceding numbers in the sequence. The `test_fib4` function contains unit tests to verify the functionality of the `fib4` function. The script then demonstrates the usage of the `fib4` function by calling it with various input values and asserting that the returned values are correct.

The provided Python code defines a function to generate the Fibonacci sequence and passes corresponding tests to verify its correctness. The use of descriptive comments and meaningful variable names enhances code readability and maintainability.
