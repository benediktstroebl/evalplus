This Python code defines a function called `fib4` that computes the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence. The function uses a `yield` keyword to return the current value and the next value in each iteration, creating a continuous sequence.

The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the corresponding Fibonacci number. The function demonstrates the efficient computation by avoiding recursion and using an iterative approach with a loop and a generator expression. The tests pass successfully, showing that the function works correctly for various input values.
