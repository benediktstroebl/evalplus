This script defines a function `fib4` that computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence using a loop-free approach. It uses a fact that the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous three numbers in the sequence to get the next number. The function is tested with various inputs, and the test cases assert the function's output matches the expected result.

This code uses a simple mathematical property to achieve the loop-free solution, and the whole process is contained within the function, making it self-contained and efficient.
