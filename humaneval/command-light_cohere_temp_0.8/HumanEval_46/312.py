```

This code defines a function `fib4` that computes the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using the iterative approach. The function starts with base cases for n equal to 0, 1, and 2, and then uses the recursive approach to compute other elements. The tests are also included to ensure the correctness of the `fib4` function.
