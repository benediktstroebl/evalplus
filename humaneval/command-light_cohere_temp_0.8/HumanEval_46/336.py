```python
def fib4(n: int):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    else:
        return fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

def test_fib4():
    assert fib4(5) == 4
    assert fib4(6) == 8
    assert fib4(7) == 14
    assert fib4(8) == 24
    assert fib4(9) == 45
    assert fib4(10) == 55
```
The code defines a function called fib4 that computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence using the recursive approach without using repeated values. The test_fib4 function contains several tests to ensure the correctness of the fib4 function, passing various inputs to the function and checking the results against the expected Fibonacci sequence values.
