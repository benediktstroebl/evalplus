#The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which the next number is the sum of the two preceding ones. It has been studied extensively and has many applications in mathematics, computer science, and engineering. The Fibonacci sequence can be generated using a recursive formula or an iterative one. The Python script above uses a recursive approach to generate the sequence and passes all the tests.
