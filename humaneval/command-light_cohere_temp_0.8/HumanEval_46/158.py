```python
def fib4(n: int):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    else:
        return fib4(n - 1) + fib4(n - 2) + fib4(n - 3) + fib4(n - 4)

# Test the function
def test_fib4():
    n = 7
    result = fib4(n)
    assert result == 14  # Check the result against the expected value

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_fib4()
```

This code defines a function `fib4` that computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence without recursion. It uses a specific conditions to determine the base cases and then calculates the sum of the appropriate Fibonacci numbers for the remaining cases. The test function `test_fib4` is used to verify the correctness of the `fib4` function by checking if the result is equal to the expected value for a given input `n`.  This ensures that the function is working as intended.
