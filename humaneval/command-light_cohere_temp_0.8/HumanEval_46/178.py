The code defines a function called `fib4` that computes the n-th Fibonacci number using a loop, without using recursion. It then has a set of unit tests using the `assert` function to verify the correctness of the `fib4` function. The test_fib4 function runs these tests and asserts that the `fib4` function produces the correct results. 

This code is self-contained and does not require any additional code or functions to be considered solved.
