```
The above code defines a function called fib4 which computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence using a formula and returns the result. The function is then tested using the test_fib4 function, which passes the test by calling the fib4 function with different input values and comparing the returned values to the expected results from the Fibonacci sequence.
