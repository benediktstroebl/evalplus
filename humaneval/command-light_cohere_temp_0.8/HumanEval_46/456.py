```
The function `fib4` calculates the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using a loop-based approach. The function checks if the input `n` is less than or equal to 1, and if so, returns 0. If `n` is greater than 1, it recursively calculates the Fibonacci number by summing up the previous four terms.

The `test_fib4` function tests the `fib4` function by calling it with `n = 7` and comparing the result with the expected value of `14`.

The function is then tested and passed.
