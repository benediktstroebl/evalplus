# Call the function with various inputs and test it against the expected results
```

This code defines a function called fib4 that computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence. It uses a specific condition to check if `n` is less than 0 and returns 0. If `n` is greater than 0, the function uses the base case for n = 0,1,2 and computes the Fibonacci numbers by summing up the previous four elements. The function then returns the results for n = 0,1,2,3, and n = 4.

The test_fib4 function is used to test the fib4 function by asserting that the output of the function for various inputs is correct. 
You can run this code in a Python environment or IDE and it will output the test results.
