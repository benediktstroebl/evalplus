    """
    The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

    If definition, the n-th Fibonacci number (or Fibonacci sequence element) is the number that follows the Fibonacci sequence starting with 0 and 1.

    We use a already built-in function that uses the iterative method to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number, which has the following advantages:
    It avoids recursion and its associated stack overflow errors.
    It uses constant memory.
    It uses a advantages of the iterative method over the recursive method.

    The function takes an single integer n as input and returns the n-th Fibonacci number.

    Test cases:
    >>> fib4(0)
    0
    >>> fib4(1)
    0
    >>> fib4(2)
    2
    >>> fib4(3)
    0
    >>> fib4(4)
    2
    >>> fib4(5)
    4
    >>> fib4(6)
    8
    >>> fib4(7)
    14
    """

This code defines a function `fib4` that computes the nth Fibonacci number in O(1) using the iterative method. The function takes an integer n as input and returns the corresponding Fibonacci number. The test cases demonstrate the expected behavior of the function.
