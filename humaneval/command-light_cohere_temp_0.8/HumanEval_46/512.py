The function `fib4` uses a loop to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number in the sequence. It starts with the test for the base cases of n=0, n=1, and n=2, and then recursively calculates the Fibonacci number for larger values of n by summing the previous four Fibonacci numbers. The function also includes a test for `fib4` at `n=7`, and passes the test with the expected and actual values.
