```
The provided Python script defines a function `fib4` that computes the n-th Fibonacci number in O(1) using an efficient algorithm that avoids recursion. The function utilizes a sum function to calculate the sum of the preceding four numbers in the Fibonacci sequence for each value of n.

The `test_fib4` function serves as a test case to verify the correctness of the `fib4` function. It calls the `fib4` with the argument 5, and the result should be 4, which matches the expected output.

The code is well-structured and efficiently calculates Fibonacci numbers without relying on recursion, providing a clear and concise solution to the problem.

Note: The code above is a self-contained solution to the problem of computing the n-th Fibonacci number using a non-recursive approach.  It uses the simple formula and efficient calculations to achieve a solution. 

Also, feel free to modify and use the code for your specific use cases.
