```python
def fib4(n: int):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    else:
        return fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

def test_fib4():
    n = 7
    expected = 14
    actual = fib4(n)
    assert expected == actual, f"Test failed with n={n} expected={expected}, actual={actual}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_fib4()
```

This code defines a function called `fib4` that computes the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using a loop-free approach. It uses a basic arithmetic to calculate the sum of the four previous numbers in the sequence, which is the definition of the Fibonacci sequence. 

The `test_fib4` function contains a test case for the `fib4` function, where it computes the 7th element of the Fibonacci sequence and compares the result against the expected value of 14.

This code is self-contained and does not require any additional modules or external functions. It provides a simple and efficient computation of Fibonacci numbers without the use of recursion.
