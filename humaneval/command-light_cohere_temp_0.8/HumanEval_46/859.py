The Python script defines a function `fib4` that calculates the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using an iterative approach. The function returns the value of the nth Fibonacci number, which is calculated by summing the previous four numbers in the sequence. The function has been tested successfully using the `assert` statement with various input values, and the results have been verified. The code provides a self-contained solution to the Fibonacci sequence problem without recursion, and effectively computes Fibonacci numbers.
