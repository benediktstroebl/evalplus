```python
def fib4(n: int):
    """The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each subsequent number is equal to the sum of the two preceding ones.

    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    else:
        return fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

```

This Python code defines a function called fib4, which computes the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using a technique that avoids recursion. It returns the general formula for computing the nth Fibonacci number: 
- If n is less than or equal to 0, it returns 0.
- If n is 1, it returns 0.
- If n is 2, it returns 2.
- For n is greater than 2, it recursively calls fib4(n-1) and adds the result to itself, followed by fib4(n-2), fib4(n-3), and fib4(n-4). 
This function can be used to efficiently calculate the nth Fibonacci number for any given integer n.
