This code defines a function fib4 that computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence using a loop-based approach. The function follows the basic strategy of breaking the problem down into smaller subproblems and solving each subproblem recursively until the base case is reached. The test_fib4 function tests the fib4 function using various input values and asserts that the results are correct. The code is self-contained and does not require external functions or modules to be defined.
