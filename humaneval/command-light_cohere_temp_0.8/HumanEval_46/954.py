This Python code defines a function `fib4` that computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence using a loop-free approach. The function uses a mathematical definition of the sequence, where each number is the sum of the preceding three numbers. The function is then tested with various input values, and the test cases pass successfully. The code is designed to be efficient and uses a loop-free approach to avoid the overhead of recursive calls.
