The Python script defines the `fib4` function that calculates the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using a non-recursive approach. The `test_fib4` function is used to test the `fib4` function with different input values. The program takes user input for the number of term (n) and then prints the corresponding Fibonacci term.
