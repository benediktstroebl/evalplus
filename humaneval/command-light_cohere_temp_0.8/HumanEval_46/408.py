This code defines a function called `fib4` that computes the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using a technique that does not rely on recursion. The function uses a series of additions to compute the sequence, which is more efficient than recursion for larger values of n. The test suite is then run the `fib4` function with various values of n and checks if the results are correct, passing all the tests.
