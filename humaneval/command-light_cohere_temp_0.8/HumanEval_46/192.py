The provided code defines a Python function called `fib4`, which computes the nth value of the Fibonacci sequence using an optimized algorithm that avoids recursion. It also has a test suite that verifies the correctness of the `fib4` function. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ensures that the test suite is run only when the script is executed directly, not when it's imported as a module.
