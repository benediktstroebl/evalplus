This Python code defines a function called fib4 that computes the n-th Fibonacci number using the recursive method, avoiding the use of recursion. It also includes test cases to validate the function's behavior for different input values. The code demonstrates the example of a self-contained function that efficiently computes Fibonacci numbers without relying on external recursion.
