The Python script defines a function `fib4` that computes the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence without recursion. The function employs a basic control flow with conditional statements to determine the sequence. The function is tested using the `test_fib4` function, which includes various input validation assertions. The script is structured using meaningful variable and function names, adheres to the Python conventions and best practices.
