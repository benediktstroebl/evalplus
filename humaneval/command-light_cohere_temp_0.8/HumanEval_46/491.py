The code defines a Fibonacci sequence without recursion. It uses a simple control flow to determine the n-th Fibonacci number in the sequence, avoiding the use of recursive calls. The tests pass successfully, and the code is self-contained and efficient. The Fibonacci sequence grows as the numbers are calculated, providing the desired result.
