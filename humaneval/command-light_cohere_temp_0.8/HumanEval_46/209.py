This code defines a function called `fib4` that computes the nth Fibonacci number in a loop using the formula for the nth Fibonacci number. The function then has a test suite to ensure its correctness. 

The `test_fib4` function tests the `fib4` function with various input values and asserts that the function's output is correct. 
Lastly, the `test_fib4` function is called to run the test suite and verify the `fib4` function's correctness.
