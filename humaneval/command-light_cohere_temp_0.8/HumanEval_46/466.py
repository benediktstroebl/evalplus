The Fibonacci sequence is a mathematical sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The sequence begins with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers. The function above uses an iterative approach to calculate the Fibonacci sequence without recursion.
