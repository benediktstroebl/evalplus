```python
def fib4(n: int):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    else:
        return fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

def test_fib4():
    n = 7
    expected = 14
    actual = fib4(n)
    assert expected == actual, f"Incorrect result: {expected}, got {actual}"

test_fib4()
```

This Python code defines a function `fib4` that computes the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using an efficient, non-recursive approach. The function first checks for base cases (where n is 0, 1, and 2), returning 0, and then uses a loop to recursively calculate the rest of the sequence. The function is then tested by a function `test_fib4` that creates an instance of `fib4` with n=7, and compares the result with the expected value of 14.

This is an efficient way to calculate Fibonacci numbers without the overhead of recursion.
