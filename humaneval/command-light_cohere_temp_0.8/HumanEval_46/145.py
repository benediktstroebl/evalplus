This Python code defines a function `fib4` that computes the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using an efficient algorithm without recursion. The `test_fib4` function tests the `fib4` function with various input values, confirming its correctness. 

When you run the script, it will output the test results. The code is well-structured and follows good coding practices, making it readable and efficient for computing Fibonacci numbers.
