This Python code defines a function `fib4` that computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence using the recurrence relation and tests it with various inputs. It uses the code for better readability and encapsulation, making the logic self-contained and easier to understand. The `test_fib4` function provides unit tests to ensure the correctness of the `fib4` function. 

This approach is more organized and easier to maintain, as the logic is contained within the function, and the tests verify its correctness.
