This Python code defines a function called `fib4` that computes the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using an efficient recursive approach that avoids recursion. It then has a function `test_fib4` that accepts user input for n, and verifies if the Fibonacci number for that n exists. The code effectively demonstrates the method of calculating Fibonacci numbers without recursion and provides a means to check if the result is correct.
