The function `fib4` computes the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence, which is a series of numbers in which each subsequent term is a fraction of the sum of the two preceding terms. The function uses a optimized approach to calculate the Fibonacci sequence without recursion, which helps to avoid the risk of stack overflow. The test function `test_fibonacci` is used to check if the `fib4` function can compute the Fibonacci sequence correctly for different input values.
