The provided code defines a function called fib4 that computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence using the recursion-free technique. The function works by checking the base cases for n=0,1, and 2, and then using the previously computed values to calculate the next Fibonacci numbers by summing up the previous four values. The function is then tested with test_fib4() to ensure its correctness.

The output of the function is the n-th Fibonacci number in the sequence. The test_fib4() function tests the function by calling it with different values of n and printing the results.
