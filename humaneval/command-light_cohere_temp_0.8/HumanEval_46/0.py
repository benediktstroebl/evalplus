```python
def fib4(n: int):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    else:
        return fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

def test_fib4():
    assert fib4(5) == 4
    assert fib4(6) == 8
    assert fib4(7) == 14
    assert fib4(8) == 24
    assert fib4(9) == 45
    assert fib4(10) == 56
```
The Fibonacci sequence, which numbers are identified by the series of Fibonacci numbers, is calculated using the function `fib4` in this Python script. To handle the integer 'n', the function accepts a parameter. It begins with a if `n` equals 0, in which case it returns 0. The function then returns 0 if `n` equals 1, as there is just one number in the sequence at that point. The function returns 2 if `n` equals 2, which corresponds to the second number in the Fibonacci sequence. The function then returns 0 if `n` equals 3, as there are no numbers after that in the sequence. The function returns the final value by summing up the results of `fib4(n-1)`, `fib4(n-2)`, `fib4(n-3)`, and `fib4(n-4)`. This handles the Fibonacci sequence up to the `n`th element.

The test_fib4 function is then used to test the `fib4` function. It asserts that the result of `fib4` for the values `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, and `10` is, respectively, the same as the values in the Fibonacci sequence. 

This script demonstrates the creation of a function that uses an iterative method to calculate the Fibonacci sequence without recursion, and it offers a method for testing this function.
