This code defines a function `fib4` that computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence using the formula `fib4(n) = fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)`. It also includes a test function, `test_fibonacci4`, which validates the correctness of the `fib4` function with various input values. The code is self-contained and does not rely on external functions or modules for its implementation. 

This is the code's desired functionality. It provides a specific and self-contained solution to the problem.
