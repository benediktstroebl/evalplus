```
The function `fib4` calculates the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using the recurrence relation formula. It is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The test function `test_fib4` is used to check the correctness of the `fib4` function. The code is self-contained and provides a simple implementation of the Fibonacci sequence and passes the corresponding tests.
