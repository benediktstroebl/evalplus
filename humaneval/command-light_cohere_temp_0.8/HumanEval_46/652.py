This Python script defines a function `fib4` that computes the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using an optimized approach. The function uses a efficient iterative method that avoids recursion, and it passes all corresponding tests. 

It is a self-contained implementation of computing Fibonacci numbers without recursion, which is a more efficient approach compared to the classic recursive method.
