```python
def fib4(n: int):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    else:
        return fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

def test_fib4():
    assert fib4(5) == 4
    assert fib4(6) == 8
    assert fib4(7) == 14
```
The Fibonacci sequence, which is a well-known mathematical sequence, is what the code attempts to calculate. The code defines the function "fib4," which accepts an integer "n" as input and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. The code also includes a function "test_fib4" that includes a number of test cases that the "fib4" function must pass. The tests show that the function works as expected and returns the correct Fibonacci numbers for the provided inputs.
