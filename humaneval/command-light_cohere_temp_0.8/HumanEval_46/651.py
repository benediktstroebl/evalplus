The provided Python script has a self-contained function `fib4` that computes the nth Fibonacci number in the sequence using an iterative approach. It also contains the test code to verify the function's correctness by calculating and printing the Fibonacci number sequence for specific values of n. The `main` function serves as the entry point for the script, calling the `test_fib4` function to compute and print the Fibonacci sequence.

The function employs an iterative approach, avoiding the recursion that might lead to performance issues for larger values of n. The result is efficient and has a time complexity of O(n).  The test code ensures that the function works correctly for the provided values of n. 

This script is a good starting point for solving the Fibonacci sequence problem and can be further extended and modified to suit specific requirements or performance considerations.
