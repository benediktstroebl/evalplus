The provided Python code defines a function called fib4 that computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence using a non-recursive approach. The function employs a fact that each number in the sequence is the sum of the preceding two numbers, which are then incremented by 1. 

The test_fib4 function contains tests that validate the correctness of the fib4 function by checking if the calculated result matches the expected value for specific input values. These tests are verify the use the fibonacci sequence to calculate the n-th element of a given number and ensure the accuracy of the results. 

The code's test_fib4_2 function includes additional tests that validate the function's behavior for larger values of n, ensuring the correctness of the Fibonacci sequence calculation even for larger inputs.
