```
The provided code defines a function called `fib4`, which computes and returns the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence. The function utilizes a recursive approach to calculate the sequence, starting with the base cases (for n = 0, 1, 2) and then summing the previous three numbers to compute the next value.

The function includes input validation to ensure that the input n is a positive integer. It also includes an return statement to indicate that the Fibonacci sequence does not exist for negative numbers.
