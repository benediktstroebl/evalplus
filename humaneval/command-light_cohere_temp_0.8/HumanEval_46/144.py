```python
def fib4(n: int):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    else:
        return fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

def test_fib4():
    n = 7
    assert fib4(n) == 14  # Expected result: Fibonacci number at position n

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_fib4()
```
This Python script defines the `fib4` function, which computes the n-th Fibonacci number using a specific sequence computation, and passes the test using the `test_fib4` function. The `fib4` function returns `None` if `n` is 0, 1, or 2, as these are the base cases for the Fibonacci sequence. If `n` is equal to 3, it returns 0. Otherwise, it recursively computes the n-th Fibonacci number by summing up the previous four values in the sequence. The `test_fib4` function sets the variable `n` to 7, which should produce the desired result, a Fibonacci number at position 7. The test passes successfully, so this code seems to be correct.
