The provided Python code defines a function called fib4 that calculates the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using a specific mathematical formula. The function follows the recursive approach to compute the Fibonacci numbers and provides the result for various input values. The code also includes unit tests to verify the correctness of the fib4 function. The tests pass successfully, confirming the functionality of the code.

The code structure and organization are clear and efficient, with the function and tests separated into distinct blocks. This approach helps the notable and follows good software engineering practices.
