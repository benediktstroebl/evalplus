    assert fib4(5) == 4, "Assertion failed: fib(5) != 4"
    assert fib4(6) == 8, "Assertion failed: fib4(6) != 8"

# Run the function and tests
test_fib4()
```
The code defines a function fib4 that computes the n-th Fibonacci number using a loop, avoiding recursion. The test_fib4 function contains assertions to validate the correctness of the fib4 function by comparing the returned values with the expected values.  The test_fib4 function is then run, which executes the fib4 and test_fib4 functions and prints the test results.

In this version of the code, the fib4 function is fully self-contained, and it doesn't rely on any external functions or modules. The test_fib4 function provides a simple test suite to ensure the correctness of the fib4 function.
