This Python code defines a function called fib4 that computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each successive number is the sum of the two preceding ones. 

This function follows the defined pattern and computes the Fibonacci number using the sum of the last four numbers. The test_fib4 function tests the function with n = 7 and ensures the function output is correct. 

This code is self-contained and does not require any external functions or modules. It can be used as a starting point to solve Fibonacci sequence problems efficiently.
