```python
def fib4(n: int):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    else:
        return fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

def test_fib4():
    n = 5
    assert fib4(n) == 4
    n = 6
    assert fib4(n) == 8
    n = 7
    assert fib4(n) == 14

def main():
    test_fib4()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
The code defines a function called fib4, which computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence without recursion. The test_fib4 function then calls fib4 with different values of n and asserts that the result is equal to the expected value. The code is well-structured, and the function and tests are self-contained, demonstrating the capability to calculate Fibonacci numbers efficiently without relying on external recursion.
