Here is the code:
```python
def fib4(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    else:
        return fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(fib4(5))
    print(fib4(6))
    print(fib4(7))
```
This code defines a function fib4 that computes the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence. It uses a a strategy of calculating Fibonacci numbers by summing the previous three numbers in the sequence, which avoids the need for recursion and improves efficiency.
