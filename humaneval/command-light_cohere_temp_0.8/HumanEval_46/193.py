```python
def fib4(n: int):
    """The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which the next number is equal to the sum of the two preceding ones:
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    else:
        return fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2)

# Testing the function
def test_fib4():

Do you want help with anything else?
