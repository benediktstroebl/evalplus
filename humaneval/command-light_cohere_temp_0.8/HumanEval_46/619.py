The code provides a solution for calculating Fibonacci numbers using a loop-based approach. The function `fib4(n: int)` takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the nth Fibonacci number using a series of nested loops. The function then returns the number.

The `__main__` block then calls the `fib4` function for various input values and prints out the results. The output will be the series of Fibonacci numbers.

The script is self-contained, and does not require any external functions or modules. It is a way to solve the problem and pass the tests. 

The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the input number. The space complexity is O(n) due to the loop. The solution is efficient for large input values.
