```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return n == 4 * 2
    else:
        return False
```

This Python function, `is_equal_to_sum_even`, determines whether a given number `n` can be represented as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers. It does this by assessing whether `n` is even and, if so, matches the value to 4 * 2, which is the equivalent representation of the sum of four even integers. If the number is not even even, it returns `False`. This function is designed to be efficient and self-contained, with no external dependencies or functions called. It can be easily tested for a range of integers and quickly determine whether the sum of four positive even numbers equals `n`.
