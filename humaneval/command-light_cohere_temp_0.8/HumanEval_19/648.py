Your Python script contains a function `sort_numbers` which sorts a string of numbers in ascending order. The function uses a `numbers.make_set` function to ensure that only numbers are in the string. It uses the `numbers.isdigit()` method to convert the input string to a list of numbers. Then, it uses the `set` function to filter out all non-numeric characters from the list and converts the rest to a set of numbers. The final sorted list is then converted back to a string and returned.

The function is also well-tested using the `unittest` module, with a test case that passes the test and a corresponding expected result. The test case uses the test_sort_numbers` function and the `run` method from `unittest. Expected test results` to check that the output of the function is the correct sorted version of the input string.
