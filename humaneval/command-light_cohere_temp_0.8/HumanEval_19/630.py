Here's the solution:
```python
from typing import List
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    # Convert input string into a list of integers
    numbers_list = [int(num) for num in numbers.
    # Sort the
         numbers_list = sorted(numbers_list)
    # Join the sorted numbers into a string
    return ''.join(). specific test cases. 
For example:
numbers = 'three one five'
result = sort_numbers(numbers)
assert result == 'one threefive'

numbers = 'zero one two three four five six seven eight nine'
result = sort_numbers(numbers)
assert result == 'zero onesix seven eight nine'
```
This solution creates a function called sort_numbers that takes a string of numbers and returns a sorted version of that string. The function uses Python's built-in sort function to sort the list of numbers and then returns the sorted string. The test cases demonstrate the expected behavior for different inputs.
