This Python code defines a function `sort_numbers` that sorts a given string of numbers and passes all corresponding tests. The `test_sort_numbers` list contains test cases with strings representing pairs of numbers, which are passed to the `sort_numbers` function to sort. The `test` function runs unit tests to verify if the `sort_numbers` function is working correctly, and checks if the actual result matches the expected output for each test case. 
Finally, the `test_negative_numbers` and `test_mixed_numbers` functions run additional tests to cover negative and mixed number cases.
