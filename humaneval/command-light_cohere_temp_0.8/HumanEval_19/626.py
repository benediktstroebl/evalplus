Here's a self-contained Python function that sorts and cleans up a string of numbers:
```python
import re
from typing import List

def clean_and_sort_numbers(input_str: str) -> str:
    # Remove non-numeric characters and keep only digits
    cleaned_numbers = re.sub('[^,@]+', '', input_str)
    numbers = list(cleaned_numbers)  # Convert string to list of digits

    # Remove duplicates and sort
    unique_numbers = list(set(numbers))
    sorted_numbers = sorted(unique_numbers)

    return ' '.join(sorted_numbers)
```
The provided Python function, `clean_and_sort_numbers`, takes an input string containing a collection of numbers and performs several operations to clean and sort the numbers. This function utilizes the unique approach that ensures both the cleaning and sorting processes are self-contained within the function, reducing the need for external functions or modules.
