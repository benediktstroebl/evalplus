Here's a self-contained Python script with a function that sorts numbers in Markdown code blocks:
```python
from typing import List
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    # Convert input to list of strings
    numbers = [num.split(' ' ')
    for num in numbers.
    # Sort numbers from smallest to largest
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers, reverse=True)
    # Join the sorted numbers back into a string
    return ' '.join(sorted_numbers)

# Test cases
test_data = [
    'three one five',
    'zero two three four five six seven eight nine'
]
test_cases = [
    'one threefive',
    'two three four five six seven eight nine'
]

for test_case in test_cases:
    assert sort_numbers(test_case) == test_case  # Validate the output matches the expected Markdown code
```
This code defines a function **`sort_numbers`** that takes a string of numbers separated by spaces as input and returns the same string with numbers sorted from smallest to largest. The code also includes a test suite that validates the correctness of the **`sort_numbers`** function with a set of test cases.
