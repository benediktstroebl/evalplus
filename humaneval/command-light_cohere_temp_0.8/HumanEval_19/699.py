```python
from typing import List

def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    return numbers. "three one five"
```

def test_sort_numbers():
    assert sort_numbers("three one five") == "one three five", "First and second arguments must be strings with numbers separated by spaces"

Here is the test function that checks if the function is working as expected. This can be used as a way to ensure the function's correctness and reliability.
