```python
from typing import List
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    return numbers.
    # Choices are valid:
    # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
    valid_choices = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine']
    if not any(n in valid_choices for n in numbers):
        raise ValueError("Invalid input. Input should only contain digits from 0 to 9.")
    return numbers.
    else:
        return numbers.  # Round numbers to the specific order.  # Creation of the simplest sorting algorithm that works by comparing the current character with the next one and moving them accordingly. 
```

Here, we use a string testing framework to test if the input is a valid number. We can add additional tests to test for a variety of inputs, including strings that contain non-numeric characters or digits outside the range of 0 to 9.
