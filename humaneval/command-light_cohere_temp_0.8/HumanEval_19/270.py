```python
from typing import List
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    return numbers.ortsorted()
stringsorted()

numbers = """three one five"""

print(sort_numbers(numbers))
```
The above Python script defines a function named sort_numbers that sorts a given string of numbers in ascending order and returns the sorted string.

The function takes a string of numbers and uses the sorted() method from the string module to sort the numbers into ascending order. The sorted numbers are then converted back to a string using the str.

The test cases are also included in the script. It is a example string with numbers that are passed to the function and the expected output is printed.
