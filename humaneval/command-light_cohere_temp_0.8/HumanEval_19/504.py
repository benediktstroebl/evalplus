```python
from typing import List
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    return numbers.

def test_sort_numbers() -> None:
    assert sort_numbers('three one five') == 'one three five'
    assert sort_numbers('zero one two three four five six seven eight nine') == 'zero one two three four five six seven eight nine'
    assert sort_numbers(' Ten Analogy ') == ' ten analogy '
    assert sort_numbers(' 10 ) == ' 10'
    assert sort_numbers('-123.456') == '-123.456'
    graphics.
```  The main function in the script, sort_numbers, is a self-contained Python function that sorts a given string of numbers. It takes a string of numbers and returns a sorted string. The function works by using the input string numbers and the sorting algorithm to sort the numbers from smallest to largest.
