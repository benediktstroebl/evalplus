```python
from typing import List
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    return numbers. Test cases can be passed to sort_numbers with the correct expected output.

# Example case: Sorting numbers from smallest to largest
numbers = 'three one five eight six seven nine'
print(sort_numbers(numbers))  # Output: 'one threefive eight six seven nine'

# Example case: Sorting strings with numbers (should sort as characters)
numbers = 'banana 23123 apple'
print(sort_numbers(numbers))  # Output: 'apple 23123 banana'

# Test case with invalid input
numbers = 'zero four five six'
print(sort_numbers(numbers))  # Error: type error: 'str' object has no attribute 'sort'
