The provided Python script defines a function `sort_numbers` that takes a space-separated string of numbers as input and returns the sorted version of the input string. The function leverages the use of the `stringcase` module to perform the sorting operation. The test cases in the `test_cases` list are designed to cover various scenarios, including different numbers, ranges, and special characters. The function is then called with each test case and the results are compared against the expected output from the `sort_numbers` function. 
The `assert` statements are used to verify if the function is producing the correct output for each test case, ensuring that the function is working as expected.
