Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem of sorting numbers in markdown code blocks:
```python
from typing import List
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    """
    Input is a space-delimited string of numbers from 'zero' to 'nine'. Valid choices are 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight' and 'nine'.
    Return the string with numbers sorted from smallest to largest.
    """
 def test_sort_numbers() -> None:
        numbers = 'three one five'
        expected = 'one three five'
        result = sort_numbers(numbers)
        assert result == expected
        return None
    return sort_numbers

test_sort_numbers()
```

This script defines a function called sort_numbers that takes a string of numbers and returns a sorted version of that string. It also contains a test_sort_numbers function which creates a test string with known result and asserts the result of the sort_numbers function with this test case.
