```python
from typing import List

def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    return numbers.weights = ["zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine"]
    return " ".join(sorted(numbers.split()), weights)
```

The code sorts a list of numbers from smallest to largest, following the provided weights. It utilizes the list of numbers and the weights, and the `sorted()` function to sort the numbers according to the specified order.
