```python
import stringIO
from typing import List
from unittest import mock, TestCase, mock_open, patch

def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    # Create a mock object for 'open' function
    with mock_open('', 'r') as mock_file:
        # Mock the open function to read the string 'numbers'
        # Assign the mock file object to the 'file' parameter of the sort_numbers function
        mock_file.read() = numbers
        Mock.open()
     # open()
        with open(stringIO.StringIO(''), 'r') as f:
        # Call the sort_numbers function
        result = sort_numbers(f.read())
    open(). walkthrough with mock, by providing details on expected behavior and results.
```

To make sure that the function `sort_numbers` works as expected, we can write a test function. In the test function, we can pass a sample string of numbers, which will be read from the input stream, and we expect the `numbers` string to be sorted from smallest to largest.

We can then call the `sort_numbers` function with the `mock_open` context manager, which will read the numbers string from the input stream and pass it to the `sort_numbers` function. Finally, we can check the expected output with the test string.

We can then run the test function with the `unittest` module, which will print the results of the test function.

In summary, this Python script with a self-contained function `sort_numbers` that sorts a string of numbers from smallest to largest, using the mock object to test the function's behavior.
