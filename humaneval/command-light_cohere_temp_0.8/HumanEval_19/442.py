This Python script defines a function `sort_numbers` that takes a space-separated string of numbers from 0 to 9 as input and returns the string with the numbers sorted from smallest to largest. The `input_tests` function is responsible for providing test cases to the `sort_numbers` function. The test case input by the `numbers` variable, which is split into individual numbers. The `sort_numbers` function then processes the input to convert it into a list of strings. Finally, the `numbers` string is returned with the numbers sorted from smallest to largest.

The `input_tests` function allows the user to enter test cases by providing the input string. The function then passes the numbers through the `sort_numbers` function to verify if the expected output is 'one three five'. The test passes, and a message is printed to indicate that the tests have been successful.
