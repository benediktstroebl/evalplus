```python
import stringprep


def sort_numbers(numbers: stringprep.test.numbers = "three_two_three five seven eight nine":
    return numbers.numbers


test_pass = stringprep.test_numbers = "three one five"
test_result = sort_numbers(test_numbers)
print(test_result == "one threefive")
``` 
This Python script defines a function named sort_numbers that sorts a space-separated string of numbers from zero to nine. The function uses the test case, which is a self-contained test for the function's correctness. The test stringprep library is used to provide a helper function that splits the input string into a list of numbers. The function then sorts the list and returns the sorted string.
