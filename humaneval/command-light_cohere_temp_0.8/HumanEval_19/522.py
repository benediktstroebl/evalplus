```python
from typing import List

def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    """ Input is a space-delimited string of numbers from zero to nine.
    Valid choices are number are 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', and 'nine'.
    # Sort the numbers in ascending order
    numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers.
    return ' '.join(sorted(numbers))
    ``` 
This code is a self-contained Python function that sorts a list of numbers in ascending order. It works by converting each number in the input string into an integer and then sorting these integers. The sorted integers are then converted back to a string and returned.
