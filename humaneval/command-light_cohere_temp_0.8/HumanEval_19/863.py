```python
from typing import List

def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    return numbers.

# Unit tests
def test_sort_numbers():
    numbers = "three one five"
    expected = "one three five"
    assert numbers == sort_numbers(numbers)
    assert expected == "".join_strings(sorted(numbers.split()))
```

This Python script defines a function `sort_numbers` that sorts a space-separated string of numbers from 'zero' to 'nine'. The function takes a string as input and returns the sorted string. It also includes a unit tests using the `assert` statement, which checks if the function's output matches the expected output.
