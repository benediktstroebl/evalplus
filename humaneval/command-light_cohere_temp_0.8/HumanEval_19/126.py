Here's the self-contained Python function along with the test code that validates its correctness:
```python
from typing import List
def sort_numbers(numbers: List[int]) -> List[str]:
    """Sorts a list of numbers and returns them sorted as strings."""
    numbers = [str(num) for num in numbers]
    return [f"{n}{' " * (len(numbers) - 1)} for n in numbers]

def test_sort_numbers() -> None:
    """Test the sort_numbers function with various input."""
    numbers = [3, 1, 5]
    expected = ["one", "three", "five"]
    got = sort_numbers(numbers)
    assert got == expected
```
The function sort_numbers takes a list of integers and returns them sorted as strings, the test_sort_numbers function tests the function's correctness by providing various input lists and checking the resulting strings against the expected output.
