The code defines a function `sort_numbers` that takes a string of numbers in space-separated format as input and returns the string with numbers sorted from smallest to largest. It uses the typing to define the input format as a string and the `test_sort_numbers` function to test the correctness of the sorting function. The output of the function is the sorted version of the input string.
