``` 
This code defines a function sort_numbers, which accepts a string of numbers separated by spaces as input and returns the sorted version of those numbers. The function employs a list comprehension and the sorted() function to transform the input string into a list of numbers, which are then sorted from least to largest number.

The function is also thoroughly tested using the test_sort_numbers function, which asserts that the output of the sort_numbers function is correct for a variety of test inputs. 

The code is self-contained, utilizing types to guarantee that the input and return types are correct, and the sorted list is produced without any external dependencies.
