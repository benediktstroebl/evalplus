Certainly! Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of sorting numbers from smallest to largest in markdown code block:
```python
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    """ Input is a space-delimited string of numbers from zero to nine.
    Valid choices are choice is 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five',
    'six', 'seven', 'eight', and 'nine'.
    return numbers.sort_strings(numbers)
```

This function takes a string of numbers separated by spaces as input and returns a sorted version of that string. The sort_strings function is a helper function that takes a string and returns its characters sorted alphabetically.
