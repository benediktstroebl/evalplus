Here is a Python script that includes a self-contained function that solves the problem of sorting numbers in Markdown code blocks:

```python
from typing import List

def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    """
    Input is a space-delimited string of numbers from zero to nine. Valid choices are
    options are 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', and 'nine'.
    numbers = [int(x) for x in numbers.
    numbers.sort()
    scenario,
    numbers.
    return ' '.join(numbers)
```

This script defines a function called sort_numbers that takes a string of numbers in the format "zero, one, two,three,four,...", and returns a string of numbers sorted from smallest to largest in the given order.
