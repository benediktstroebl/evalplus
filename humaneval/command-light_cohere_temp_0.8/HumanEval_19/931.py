Certainly! Here's the Python script with the function `sort_numbers` that sorts a list of numbers in a markdown code block:
```python
# Function to sort a list of numbers in ascending order
from typing import List


def sort_numbers(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Sorts the list of numbers in ascending order
    >>> sort_numbers([1,3,5])
    [1,3,5]
    """
    return sorted(numbers)
```
The code defines a function `sort_numbers` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a sorted list of integers. The function uses the sort() function from the list module to sort the numbers in ascending order and returns the sorted list.
