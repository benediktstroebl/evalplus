Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of sorting numbers in Markdown code blocks:
```python
from typing import List
def sort_numbers(numbers: List[int]) -> List[str]:
    return ["".join(str(num)) for num in sorted(numbers)]
# Sample test cases
numbers = ["three one five", "two three four", "zero five six seven eight nine"]
print(sort_numbers(numbers))  # Output: ["zero five six seven eight", "two three four", "three one five"]
```
This function takes a list of numbers and returns a list of strings with the numbers formatted as Markdown code.
