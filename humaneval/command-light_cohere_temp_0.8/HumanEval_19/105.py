```python
from typing import List
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    return numbers.lists = [numbers.split(' ')
    fact: int
    numbers = [str for str in numbers.must split()]
    important: numbers
    return ''.join(sorted(numbers, reverse=True))
```
This function takes a string of numbers, split by spaces, and converts them into lists of integers. The numbers are sorted from smallest to largest, and the sorted string is returned.
