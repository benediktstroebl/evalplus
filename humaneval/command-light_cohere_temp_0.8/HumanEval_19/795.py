 ```

The code contains a function that sorts a list of numbers in descending order, and a test function that checks the correctness of the sorting. The test function creates a list of numbers and passes it to the sort_numbers function, which sorts the numbers and returns the result as a string. The string is compared to the expected result, and the test passes.
