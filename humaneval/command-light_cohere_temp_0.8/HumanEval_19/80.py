Here's the self-contained Python function that sorts and returns a string with numbers from the smallest to largest, using the valid numbers from the provided prompt:
```python
from typing import List
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    """
    Input is a space-delimited string of numbers from zero to nine.
    Valid choices are string containing only digits from zero to nine.
    Return the string with numbers sorted from smallest to largest
    """
    numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers.sort()
   
    array.fromstring(numbers)
   
    return ''.join(array)
```

This function is self-contained and efficiently sorts the input numbers from smallest to largest, using Python's built-in array sorting functionality.
