```python
from typing import List

def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    return numbers. Given a string of numbers separated by spaces, returns its value sorted from smallest to largest.
    >>> sorted_numbers("three one five") == 'one three five'
    >>> sorted_numbers(" zero twelve three ") == 'zero twelve three'
    >>> sorted_numbers(" nine eight seven six five ") == 'nine eight seven six five'
    >>> sorted_numbers("99 eight 77 six 55 ") == '99 eight 77 six 55'
