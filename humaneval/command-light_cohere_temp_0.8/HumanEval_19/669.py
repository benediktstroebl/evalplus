This code is a good implementation of the function `sort_numbers`. It uses the numpy library to perform the sort operation on the array of numbers, which makes it a clean and efficient solution. The test function is well-structured and follows good coding practices. It also uses the test and passes the test cases with the `np.atools` library.
