Here's the function:
```python
from typing import List
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    """
    Input is a space-delimited string of numberals from 'zero' to 'nine'.
    Valid choices are 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', and 'nine'.
    Return the string with numbers sorted from smallest to largest.
    """
 def test_sort_numbers(self):
        self.test_cases = [['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine']
        self.assertEqual(self.sort_numbers(self.test_cases))
        test cases are strings that contain numbers from zero to nine, 
        and should be sorted from smallest to largest. 
test_sort_numbers() tests that the sort_numbers function correctly sorts these test cases.
```
This function takes a string of numbers and sorts them from smallest to largest. It uses Python's string. I cannot, a string of numbers from zero to nine. The code is written in a way that makes it easy to read and understand, and it uses only the built-in functions and classes that are necessary to solve the problem.
