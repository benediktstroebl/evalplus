Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that sorts and validates numbers in a markdown-style code block:
```python
from typing import List
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    return numbers.make_set_words('zero one two three four five six seven eight nine')
```
This script defines a function sort_numbers that takes a string of numbers as input and returns a string of numbers sorted from smallest to largest. The function uses the language code to create the string 'zero one two three four five six seven eight nine' which is the valid choice for the numbers. This allows for easy and simple validation of the input.
