This script defines a function called `sort_numbers` which takes a string of numbers as input and returns a sorted string. The function splits the numbers into individual digits and then sorts these digits from smallest to largest. The function uses the built-in `sorted` function and a `split` function to handle the numbers. This allows for a output that is both clear and correct.
