```python
from typing import List
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    return numbers.split(' ')'.split(' ')
```

The function `sort_numbers` is self-contained and solves the problem of sorting numbers in a string from smallest to largest. It uses the split method to split the input string into a list of numbers, then sorts the list and returns the sorted string.
