This Python code defines a function called sort_numbers that sorts a list of numbers in descending order, using the numbers themselves as the sorting key. The function takes a input as a string containing a list of numbers, and returns the string representation of the sorted numbers. It uses the typing module to provide type hints for the input and return values. The test cases section contains a list of test cases, and uses the assert statement to check if the function returns the expected output for each test case. 

This code demonstrates a self-contained way of sorting numbers in descending order and passing corresponding tests.
