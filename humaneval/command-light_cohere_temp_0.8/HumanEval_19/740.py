Here's a self-contained Python script with a function `sort_numbers` that sorts a list of numbers in markdown code block format:
```python
# Sorted Numbers in Markdown Format
from typing import List
def sort_numbers(numbers: List[str]) -> List[str]:
    """ Input is a list of numbers in any order, returns them sorted in increasing order.
    """
    
    # Turn each string into an integer using int()
    # Sort numbers in increasing order
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    # Return the list of sorted numbers
    return ['# {}'.format(num) for num in sorted_numbers]

# Example of: Sort a list of numbers in Markdown format
numbers = ['# three one five', '# two three eight', '# one two four']
print(sort_numbers(numbers))  # Output: ['# one three five', '# two three eight', '# one two four']
```

This code provides a self-contained function to sort a list of numbers in Markdown format. You can use this need code to quickly sort lists of numbers and display them in a readable and organized manner.
