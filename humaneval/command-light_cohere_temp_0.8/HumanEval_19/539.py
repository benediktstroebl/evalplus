The provided code defines a Python script with a self-contained function `sort_numbers`, which sorts a string of numbers. The function takes a input from the user which is a space-delimited string with numbers from 'zero' to 'nine'. The function then converts the input string into a list of numbers, sorts them, and returns the sorted result as a string.

The function is also accompanied by unit tests that check its functionality using the `test_sort_numbers` function. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block at the end ensures that the unit tests are executed when the script is run directly.
