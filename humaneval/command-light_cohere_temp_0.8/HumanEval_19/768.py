```python
from typing import List

def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    return numbers. 

def test_sort_numbers() -> None:
    tests = [
        "three one five",
        "zero two three",
        "five six seven eight nine"
    ]

    expected = [
        "one three five",
        "zero two three",
        "five six seven eight nine"
    ]

    for test, expected_result in zip(tests, expected):
        actual_result = sort_numbers(test)
        print(f"Test: {test}, Expected: {expected_result}, Actual: {actual_result})
        assert actual_result == expected_result

test_sort_numbers()
```  The provided code includes a function called sort_numbers, which accepts a string of numbers separated by spaces as input and returns the string with the numbers sorted from smallest to largest. The test_sort_numbers function contains several test cases with different input strings and expected results. The code then executes these function and compares the actual and expected results for each test case.
