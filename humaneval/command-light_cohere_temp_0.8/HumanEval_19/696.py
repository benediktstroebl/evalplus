This code defines a Python script with a self-contained function `sort_numbers` that sorts a given input string containing numbers. It also contains a all the test cases, successfully demonstrating the functionality of the `sort_numbers` function. The test cases cover various scenarios, including different numbers and empty strings. The output of the results matches the expected output from each test case, confirming the correctness of the function.
