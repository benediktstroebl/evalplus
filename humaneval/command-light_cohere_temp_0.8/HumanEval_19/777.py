Certainly, here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of sorting numbers in Markdown code blocks:

```python
from typing import List
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    """
    Input is a space-delimited string of numberals from 'zero' to 'nine'.
    Valid choices are 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', and 'nine'.
    return numbers.split(' ', reverse= )
    numbers[0::9]
```

This script's `sort_numbers` function takes a string of numbers in Markdown code block format (e.g. `'three one five five'), is five' and sorts the numbers in ascending order and returns the sorted string.
