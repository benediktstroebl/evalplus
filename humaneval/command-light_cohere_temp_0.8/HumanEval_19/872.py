```python
from typing import List
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers.
    return ' '.join(sorted(numbers))
# Tests
def test_sort_numbers():
    assert sort_numbers('three one five') == 'one three five'
def test_sort_numbers_error():
    assert sort_numbers('five one three') == 'five one three'
``` 
This script defines a function sort_numbers that takes a space-delimited string of numbers and returns a sorted version of that string. It then provides two test functions: test_sort_numbers that checks the function's output for a known correct result, and test_sort_numbers_error that checks the function's behavior when an incorrect input is passed.
