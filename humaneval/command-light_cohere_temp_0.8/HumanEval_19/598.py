This script defines a function `sort_numbers` that sorts a given list of numbers in descending order. The function is tested with a set of test cases to ensure its correctness. The code follows the Python conventions, using type hints, descriptive function and variable names, and a format that makes it easy to read and maintain. 

It provides a test case that includes a string with numbers, and then checks whether the expected output matches the output of the `sort_numbers` function.
