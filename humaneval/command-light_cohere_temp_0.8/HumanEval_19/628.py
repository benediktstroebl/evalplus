```python
from typing import List
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    """ Input is a space-delimited string of numbers from zero to nine.
    Valid choices are specific numbers: zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine.
    numbers = list(numbers.split(' '))
    sorted(numbers)
    return ' '.join(numbers)
    numbers = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine']
    return sort_numbers(' '.join(numbers))
```
The function takes a string of numbers in the format 'three one five' and returns the sorted numbers in the format 'one three five'. The function uses the split method to split the input string into a list of strings, and the list method to convert the list of strings into a list of numbers. Then, the sort method is applied to the list of numbers to sort them from smallest to largest. Finally, the join method is used to join the sorted numbers into a string.

This function is self-contained and can be used to solve the problem of sorting numbers in a markdown code block.
