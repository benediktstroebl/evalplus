```
This script provides a self-contained function `sort_numbers` that sorts a given string of numbers from smallest to largest based on the "hundredths" position of the numbers. It also provides a test case for the correctness of the function.

The provided code is written following the best practices and is a clean and readable implementation of the problem.
