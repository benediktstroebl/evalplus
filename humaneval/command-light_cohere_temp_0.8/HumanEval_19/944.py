Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of sorting numbers in a markdown code block:
```python
from typing import List
import math


def sort_numbers(numbers: List[int]) -> List[str]:
    """ Input is a list of numbers, sorts them and returns a string with numbers in sorted order.
    """ Valid choices are number from 0 to 9.
    numbers = sorted(numbers)
    return [str(num) for num in numbers if str(num) == '9' or str(num) == 'zero']
```

This code defines a function `sort_numbers` that sorts the numbers in a list and returns the sorted numbers as a string. The function first sorts the numbers in a list, and then returns the string with numbers in sorted order.
