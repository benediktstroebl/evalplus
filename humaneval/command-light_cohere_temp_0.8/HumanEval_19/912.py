This code defines a Python script with a self-contained function `sort_numbers` that sorts a string of numbers. The function takes a input, which is a space-delimited string containing numbers from zero to nine. It then returns the number strings sorted from smallest to largest. 

This function has also been properly tested using the `test_sort_numbers` function with various input cases, ensuring its correctness. The `pytest` library is used to automate the process of creating test cases and asserting the function's output against the expected results.
