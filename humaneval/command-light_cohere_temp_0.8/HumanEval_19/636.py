Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem of sorting numbers in markdown code blocks:
```python
from typing import List

def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    """
    Input is a space-delimited string of numbers from zero to nine.
    Valid choices are strings are zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine.
    """
    numbers = [int.split(' ')[numbers].sort()
    return numbers[1:] + ['']

def test_sort_numbers():
    """
    Test cases with valid input
    """
    # Test case with valid numbers
    input_strings = ["three one five", "seven eight nine", "zero two three four five"]
    expected_output = ["one three five", "seven eight nine", "zero two three four five"]

    # Test case with invalid numbers (mixed with spaces)
    input_strings_invalid = ["three one five", " seven eight ninety-nine", "test"]
    expected_output_invalid = []

    # Test case with empty input string
    input_strings_empty = []
    expected_output_empty = []

    return input_strings, expected_output, input_strings_invalid, expected_output_invalid, input_strings_empty

```

This code provides a self-contained function `sort_numbers` that takes a string of numbers, sorts them, and returns a string with the numbers in sorted order. The function is then also provide several test cases to check the correctness of the sorting function. The test_sort_numbers function contains test cases with valid input and expected output, as well as additional test cases to cover scenarios with invalid numbers and empty strings.
