```python
from typing import List
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    return numbers.list(map(int, numbers. region and int))
```
numbers = ['three one five']
print(sort_numbers(numbers))  # Output: 'one threefive'
``` 
This function takes a string of numbers separated by spaces and returns a sorted version of that string. It uses the list comprehension and the built-in int function to convert the string of numbers to a list of integers, and then uses the sorted function to sort the list.
