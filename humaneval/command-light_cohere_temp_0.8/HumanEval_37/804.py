```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    return sorted(l, key=lambda x: int(x[0] + '0'[len(x) - 1]))

# Test cases
tests = [
    [list[:]] = [1, 2, 3],
    [5, 6, 3, 4],
    [10, 20, 30],
    [100, 200, 300]
]

for test_case in tests:
    # Function call
    result = sort_even(test_case)
    print(result)
```
This Python code defines a function named `sort_even` that takes a list `l` as input and sorts its elements in- The sorting is based on the even indices of the list, where the values at those indices are identical to the values of the corresponding even indices in `l`, and the remaining elements are sorted as usual. The function uses the pattern of using the built-in function `sorted` with a custom key lambda function to achieve this sorting behavior. The code also provides several test cases, each containing a list, which are passed to the `sort_even` function to verify its correctness. The output for each of the test cases is printed.
