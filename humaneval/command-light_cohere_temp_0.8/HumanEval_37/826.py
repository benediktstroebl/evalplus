```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd index, while its values at the even index are equal to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.

    :param list l:
    The list to be sorted with even indicies.
    :return sorted(l, key=lambda x: (-x[0], x[1]))
```
We define a function called sort_even that takes a list l as input and returns a sorted list l'. The function uses the sorted function with a custom key function that sorts the list by the odd index first, and then sorts the even index items last. The list l is passed as an argument to the sorted function. The key argument to the sorted function is a lambda function that takes two elements x and returns -x[0], x[1]. This lambda function ensures that the odd index elements of the list are sorted first, and the even index elements are sorted last. The sorted function then sorts the list in place and returns the sorted list.
