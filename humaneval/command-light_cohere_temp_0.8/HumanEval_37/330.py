```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd indic, while its values at the even indicies are equal to the values of the even indic of l, but sorted."""
    return sorted(l, key=lambda x: x if x % 2 else x +1)
