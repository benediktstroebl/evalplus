    for i in range(len(lst)):

```

This Python function, `sort_even`, accepts a list `lst` as an argument. It divides the plain old, without any sorting, to make two separate lists: `even` and `odd`, depending on whether their elements' parity is even or odd. These two lists are then to be sorted, in order to create the final sorted list, lst. The function returns a lst, which contains the sorted list.
