```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the odd index, while its values at the even index are equal to the values of the even index of l, but sorted."""
    l = [1, 2, 3]
    l.sort_even(l)
    assert l == [1, 2, 3]

l = [5, 6, 3, 4]
l.sort_even(l)
assert l == [3, 6, 5, 4]
```

This Python function `sort_even` takes a list `l` as input and creates a new list `l'` such that elements at odd indices are identical to the elements at the corresponding odd indices of `l`, but sorted. The elements at even indices of `l` are equal to the corresponding elements of `l`, but sorted. The returned list `l'` is then printed to the console. The function's test is then passed to the `assert` statement with the original list `l` and the new list `l` to verify the correctness of the function.
