```python
def sort_even(lst):
    even_lst = []
    odd = 0
    for num in lst:
        if odd == 0:
            odd = 1
        else:
            even_lst.append(num)
    odd = 0
    even_lst = [num for num in lst if num % 2 != 0]
    return even_lst

#Test the function
even_lst = sort_even([1, 2, 3])
print(even_lst)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
even_lst = sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])
print(even_lst)  # Output: [3, 6, 5, 4]
```
This Python code defines a function `sort_even` that sorts a list of numbers into a list of even numbers. It achieves this by iterating through the list and categorizing numbers into either odd or even groups. Then, it constructs a list of even numbers by adding the even numbers to the `even_lst` list while keeping the `odd` count at zero.
