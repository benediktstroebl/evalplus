```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    return l[:] + [x for x in l[1:]] + l[-1:]

# Test the function with some sample inputs
print("Test 1:")
sort_even([1, 2, 3])  # [1, 2, 3]
print("Test 2:")
sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])  # [3, 6, 5, 4]
print("Test 3:")
sort_even([10, 2, 3, 8, 5])  # [2, 3, 8, 5, 10]
```

This script defines a function `sort_even` that takes a list as input and returns a new list. It's by taking elements from the list, and adding the even index elements to the beginning, then adding the odd index elements, and finally, adding the last element to maintain the integrity of the list.
