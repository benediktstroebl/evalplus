```
The function `sort_even` receives a list as an argument and returns a new list that keeps the first element of the list as it is, and appends the even indexes of the original list, and their respective values, in sorted order. This function was designed to maintain the integrity of the list, while achieving the desired effect of sorting the even indexes.
