The script defines a function `sort_even` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list `l'` which is sorted in a specific way. 

The function first creates a copy of the input list `l_copy`, then swaps the first and second elements of the list using the tuple assignment `l_copy[0], l_copy[1] = l_copy[1], l_copy[0]` to ensure that the even indices of the list are swapped.  The way to ensure that the even elements of the list are in their correct positions.
