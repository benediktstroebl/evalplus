```
This Python code defines a function `sort_even` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list `l'` that preserves the order of elements with odd indices but equal the elements with even indices to the corresponding elements of `l`. It also defines a function `even` that returns the half of the given number and a function `test_even` to test the `sort_even` function with the `even` function.
