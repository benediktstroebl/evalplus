    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd index, while its values at the even index are equal to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.

    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sorted([5, 6, 3, 4])
    [3, 6, 5, 4]

```

The code defines a function called `sort_even` that sorts a list of numbers into two categories: odd numbers and even numbers. The function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a sorted list. The `if` statement is used to test if a list of numbers is odd or even, and the `sort_even` function is called with the list of numbers as input and the sorted list is returned.
