```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd index, while its values at the even index are equal to the values of the even index of l, but sorted.
    >>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])
    [3, 6, 5, 4]
    """
    l.append(0) # Create a new even index by inserting 0 at the end of the list.
    l.sort()
    fact by sorting the first non-negative number in the list.
    l.remove(0) # Remove the this index to get rid of the zero.
    return l'

In this code, the `sort_even()` function takes a list `l` and returns a new list `l'` with the elements from the original list `l` but with the even indices sorted. 
It uses the `append()` function to add a zero at the end of the list, `sort()` function to sort the list with the even indices, and finally, removes the zero to get the list with the correct indices.
