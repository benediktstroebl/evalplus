```
This function takes a list as an argument and returns a sorted list based on the values at the even index of the input list, which are equal to the values at the even index of the original input list but in reverse order. The function also uses the modified quick sort algorithm to efficiently sort the list based on these values. The function performs in- O(nlog2) time complexity, where n is the size of the input list, and has a space complexity of O(n) as well.
