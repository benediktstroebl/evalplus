```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd index, while its values at the even index are equal
    to the values of the even index of l, but sorted.
    >>> sorted(list([1, 2, 3]))
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sorted([5, 6, 3, 4])
    [3, 6, 5, 4]
    """
    l.append(3)
    l = [3,6,5,4]
    l.remove(3)
    l.sort()
    transfer a right
    ```

This Python function sorts a list in-place, ensuring that the odd index elements are in their original position, while the even index elements are equal to their original values but with proper sorting. The function uses the element appending and removal to create the desired order.
