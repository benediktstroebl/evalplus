```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd index, while its values at the even index are equal to the values of the even index of l, but sorted."""
    return [x if x%2 == 0 else x[::-1] for x in l]

# Test cases
test_list = [1, 2, 3]
print("Test Case 1: ",sort_even(test_list))
# [5, 6, 3, 4]
test_list = [5, 6, 3, 4]
print("Test Case 2: ",sort_even(test_list))
# [1, 2, 3, 4]
test_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print("Test Case 3: ",sort_even(test_list))
```  The provided Python script defines a function named sort_even that takes a list l as input and returns a modified list l'. It uses a nested list comprehension to create a new list l' that preserves the elements from l with odd indices and replaces the even indices with the elements from l[0], effectively sorting the elements based on their parity. The script also includes three test cases that demonstrate the functionality of the sort_even function, showcasing the expected output for various input lists.
