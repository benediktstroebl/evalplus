```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd indic, while its values at the even indicies are equal
    to the values of the even indic of l, but sorted."""
    return [num for num in l if num % 2 != 0][::2] + [num for num in l if num % 2 == 0]
```
I hope this helps! Is there anything else I can assist you with with code related questions?
