This script defines a function called sort_even that takes a list l as input and returns a sorted list of values. The function first identifies the the even indexes of the list, then sorts the values of the list such that the values in the even index are equal to each other but in a sorted manner. The function also adds the certain values to the new list, starting from the first value in the even index.
