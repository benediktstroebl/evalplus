```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd index, while its values at the even index are equal to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.
    >>> sorted([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sorted([5, 6, 3, 4])
    [3, 6, 5, 4]
    """
    l.sort_even(l)
    return l
```  This Python code defines a function called sort_even. The function takes a list l as input and sorts its elements such that the odd indices of the list are identical, while the values of the even indices are equal to the values of the even indices of the original list, but in sorted order.
