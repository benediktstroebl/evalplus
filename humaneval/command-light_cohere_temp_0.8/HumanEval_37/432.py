```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd indic, while its values at the even indicies are equal to the values of the even indic of l, but sorted."""
    new_even = []
    for num in l:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            new_even.append(num)
   
    new_even = sorted(new_even)
    return new_even
``` 
This script defines a function `sort_even` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a list `l'` with elements from the original list that are either odd or even numbers in the list. The function uses a same to create a new list `new_even` and loop through the original list, appending even numbers to the new list. The new list is then sorted and returned as `l' with even numbers sorted in ascending order.
