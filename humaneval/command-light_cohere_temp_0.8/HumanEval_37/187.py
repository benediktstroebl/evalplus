The function `sort_even` takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list `l2` that is sorted according to the specified criteria. The function works by creating a new list `l2` that is identical to `l` in terms of content but with the additional requirement that the elements at even indices are equal to the corresponding elements from `l`. 

The provided test cases are then passed to the function, and the function returns the new lists `l2`. The test results are printed out, demonstrating that the function is working correctly.
