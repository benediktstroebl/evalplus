```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the odd index,
    while its values at the even index are equal to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted."""
    l = [1, 2, 3]
    return [i for i in l if i % 2 == 0] + [i for i in l if i % 2 != 0]
```
