```python
def sort_even(lst):
    even_lst = [x for x in lst if x % 2 == 0]
    even_val = [x for x in lst if x % 2 != 0][::-1]
    even_val.sort()
    micro = [y for y in range(len(even_val))]
    even_lst.append(even_val)
    lst = even_lst
    return lst

#Test cases
print(sort_even([1, 2, 3]))     # [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4]))  # [3, 6, 5, 4]
print(sort_even([2, 4, 8, 8]))  # [2, 4, 8, 8]
```  This Python code defines a function called sort_even that takes a list lst as input and aims to sort the even integers in it according to their values. The function first creates a list of even integers from the input list and stores it in the even_lst variable. Then, it creates another list, even_val, containing the odd integers from the input list, reversed. The even_val list is sorted using the sort() method, and the sorted even_val list is then added to the even_lst list. Finally, the modified list, even_lst, is assigned to the lst variable, and the sorted list is returned.
