```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    return sorted(l, key=lambda x: (x if x % 2 == 0 else x + 1))

# Test the function with some samples
sample_list = [5, 6, 3, 4]
print("Sorted list with odd: ", sort_even(sample_list))  # [3, 5, 6]
sample_list = [1, 2, 3]
print("Sorted list with even: ", sort_even(sample_list))  # [1, 2, 3]
sample_list = [5, 6, 3, 4]
print("Sorted list with odd and even: ", sort_even(sample_list))  # [3, 6, 5, 4]  # This is the expected output
``` 
This Python function, `sort_even`, is designed to transform a list into another list in a specific manner. It uses the key function to sort the list and applies a lambda function to determine whether each element is even or odd. The lambda function is utilized to assign a value of either one or two to each element, depending on whether it is even or odd. The output of the function is the list that is sorted with the odd elements appearing first and the even elements sorted in ascending order.
