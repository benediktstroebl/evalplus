```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    return sorted(l, key=lambda x: (x if x % 2 == 0 else x + 1))

# Test the function with different lists
test_list = [5, 6, 3, 4]
result = sort_even(test_list)
assert result == [3, 6, 5, 4]

test_list2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result2 = sort_even(test_list2)
assert result2 == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

test_list3 = [7, 8, 9, 10]
result3 = sort_even(test_list3)
assert result3 == [9, 10, 7, 8]
```
The provided code defines a Python function named sort_even that takes a list l as input and aims to return a sorted list with elements that are even indices kept in their original order. The key argument used within the this function is a lambda function that determines the sorting key based on whether the index is even or odd. The sorted function then uses this lambda function to sort the list accordingly. The test code includes three different lists that are passed to the sort_even function to test its correctness. The expected output will be the list that is sorted with even indices preserved and the list that is sorted with even indices swapped.
