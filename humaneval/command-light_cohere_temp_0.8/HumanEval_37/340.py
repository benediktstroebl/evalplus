```python
def sort_even(lst):
    # Sort even values and keep odd values as they are
    even = [x for x in lst if x % 2 == 0]
    odd = [x for x in lst if x % 2 != 0]
    even.sort()
   Somer even with even values as a copy, we can modify them to have the same value. The odd values are left as they same, so we can simply use the sort() function to sort the odd values in the list.
