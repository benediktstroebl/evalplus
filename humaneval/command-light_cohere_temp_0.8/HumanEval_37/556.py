```python
def sort_even(lst):
    return lst[:] + [x for x in lst if x % 2 == 0] + lst[-1:]

# Test cases:
>>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])
[1, 2, 3]
>>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])
[3, 6, 5, 4]
>>> sort_even([10, 20, 30])
[10, 20, 30]
```
This function, named sort_even, takes a list lst as input and returns a new list lst'. It creates a new list by concatenating the original list with a list of even indices from the input list, then it creates a new list by concatenating the original list with the values of the even indices from the input list. The function then returns the
This new list, lst, will have all the values from the original list, but with the even indices sorted in ascending order.
