    l = [1, 2, 3]

    l.sort()

    ```  This code defines a function `sort_even` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a list `l'` as output. The function works by first sorting the list `l` using the `sort` function. It then creates a specific list `l_odd` that contains the odd elements of the sorted list `l`. It then copies the `l_odd` list to the `l` list, and sets the even indices of the `l` list to the corresponding elements from the `l_odd` list. Finally, it calls the `sort` function on the `l` list to sort it. The final result is a list `[3, 6, 5, 4]` which is the sorted even list.
