```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd index, while its values at the even index are equal to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.
    """
    list(l)
    """
> > return a sorted list with the odd elements as they appear in the original list
<")) and the even elements as they would appear after sorting the list as a whole.

Test cases are included to pass the tests.

# Test 1
>>> sorted_even([1, 2, 3])
[1, 2, 3]

# Test 2
>>> sorted_even([5, 6, 3, 4])
[3, 6, 5, 4]

# Test 3
>>> sorted_even([10, 9, 8, 7])
[8, 9, 10]

# Test 4
>>> sorted_even([1, 10, 2, 3])
[1, 2, 3]
