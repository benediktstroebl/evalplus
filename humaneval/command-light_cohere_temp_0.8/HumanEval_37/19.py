```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd index, while its values at the even index are equal to the values of the even index of l, but sorted.

# Unit tests
def test_sort_even():
    tests = [
        [1, 2, 3],
        [5, 6, 3, 4],
    ]
    expected = [1, 2, 3]
    got = sort_even(tests)
    assert expected == got
test_sort_even()
```
The function `sort_even` receives a list `l` as input and returns a new list `l'` with the same elements as `l`, but sorted at even indices. This function ensures that the value at the even index of `l` is equal to the value at the even index of the original list, but sorted. The returned list will be identical to the original list `l` in terms of the even indices.
