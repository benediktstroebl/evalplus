```python
def sort_even(lst):
    return sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x if x % 2 == 0 else x + 1)

# Example usage:
input_list = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 4, 3, 7]
result_list = sort_even(input_list)
print(result_list)  # Expected output: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 1]
```
The function is self-contained, with the logic for sorting even numbers and odd numbers separately. The key argument is used to determine the sorting order, which allows for flexibility in how the function is called and used.
