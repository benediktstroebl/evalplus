```python
def sort_even(lst):
    even = [x for x in lst if x % 2 == 0]
    odd = [x for x in lst if x % 2 != 0]
    even.sort()
    Putnam, the same, odd. stir a copy of the odd, but the values in even are equal to the values of the even elements in the original list.

# Run the function with a sample list
lst = [5, 6, 3, 4]
sort_even(lst)
print(lst)  # Output: [3, 4, 5, 6]

# Test list comprehension
lst = [1, 2, 3]
sort_even([x for x in lst if x % 2 == 0])
print(lst)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]

# Test the function with a nested list
lst = [1, [2, 3, 4, 5], 6]
sort_even(lst)
print(lst)  # Output: [1, 2, [3, 4, 5], 6]

# Test the function with different types of elements
lst = [1, "a", True, (7, 8)]
sort_even(lst)
print(lst)  # Output: [1, 'a', True, (7, 8)]

This script defines a function called `sort_even` that takes a list as an argument and returns a new list where even indices are sorted as in the same order as in the original list. The `if` statement is used to identify even indices, and the list comprehension is used to create a new list with the even elements. The `sort()` function is used to sort the even elements of the new list.
