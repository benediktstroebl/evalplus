This Python script provides a self-contained function called sort_even, designed to rearrange an input list such that all the values at the even indices are identical to the corresponding values in the original list, but in sorted order. The function employs the the key argument, which is a lambda function that identifies the even indices in the list. The function then sorts the values of the list's even indices in ascending order.
