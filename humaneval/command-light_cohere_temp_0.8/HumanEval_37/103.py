```
The provided Python script defines a function called `sort_even` that sorts a list lst such that all odd indices become the first occurrence and even indices retain their original order. The function achieves this purpose using the `sorted` function and a lambda function as the sorting key. The script then provides three test cases to verify the functionality, passing different lists and expected to have the even elements sorted correctly.
