```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the odd index, while its values at the even index are equal to the values of the even index of l, but sorted."""
    return sorted(l, key = lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    lst = [1, 2, 3]
    lst2 = [5, 6, 3, 4]
    print("Sorted even list:",end="")
    print(sort_even(lst))
    print("Sorted even list:",end=")
    print(sort_even(lst2))
```

This script defines a function called sort_even that takes a list l as input and returns a sorted list l' where the elements at the odd index are the same as the corresponding elements at the even index of the original list, but the elements are sorted in ascending order. The key argument is used for sorting is a lambda function that takes an element x and returns its element's index (1). The reverse argument is set to True, which tells the sorting function to sort the list in descending order.

This script also provides example usage of the function with two lists, lst and lst2, and prints the sorted even lists.
