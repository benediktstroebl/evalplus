This function takes a list `l` and returns a new list `l'`. It swaps the odd index elements with the even index elements of `l`. Then, it adds the original even elements to the new list. The even elements will remain in their correct position and the new odd elements will be in their correct position. 

Therefore, the output of the function is always the original list `l` with the even elements in their correct position and the odd elements in their original position.
