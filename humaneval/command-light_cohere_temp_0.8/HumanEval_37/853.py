```
The above Python script provides a self-contained function `sort_even` that takes a list as an input and returns a sorted list based on the even indices. The function first checks if the certain conditions are met: it has an even length, and it doesn't have duplicate elements. If these conditions are met, it uses the built-in `sort` function to sort the list. If not, it uses the `sort` function with the `reverse=True` parameter to sort the list in descending order.

The tests at the end demonstrate that the function works correctly for different lists and provides the expected output.
