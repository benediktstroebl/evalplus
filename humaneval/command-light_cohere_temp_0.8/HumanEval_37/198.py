```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the odd index, while its values at the even index are equal to the values of the even index of l, but sorted."""
    return [x if x%2==0 else x[::-1] for x in l]

#Test case 1
def test1():
    assert sort_even([1, 2, 3]) == [1, 2, 3]
    
#Test case 2
def test2():
    assert sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4]) == [3, 6, 5, 4]
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    test1()
    test2()
```
This Python script defines a function named sort_even that takes a list l as input and returns a new list l' with elements in odd positions unchanged and elements in even positions copied from the original list. The test cases demonstrate that the test the function with different input lists and asserts that the returned lists are correct. The script also includes a main block where the test cases are executed, passing the function as the argument to ensure that the function is correctly implemented and the test cases pass.
