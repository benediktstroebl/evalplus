    l=list(map(int, input().Wrap('List of numbers or strings, separated by spaces').split())))
    return sorted(l)

```
This Python script defines a function `sort_even` that sorts a list of numbers or strings in a specific way. The function takes a list as input and returns a new sorted list. The function uses the particular values at the even index of the list to be equal to the corresponding value at the even index of the original list, but the list is sorted.
