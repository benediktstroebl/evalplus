```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the odd index, while its values at the even index are equal to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted."""
    l[:0:-1] = sorted(l)
    return l
``` 
This function takes a list and returns a sorted list that has the same elements in the first and last positions, and elements at even positions are equal to each other but sorted.
