```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd index, while its values at the even index are equal to the values of the even index of l, but sorted."""
    return sorted(l, key=lambda x: x if x % 2 == 0 else x -1)
```
The function uses the sorted function with a custom key function to sort the list based on even or odd indices. The custom key function checks if the list element is even or odd, returns -1 if odd, else it returns the element itself. This results in sorting the values at even indexes into the list, which are even values, in the same order.

This is a self-contained function, that is easy to read and understand, and requires minimal external libraries. It is pure and doesn't rely on other Python functions or modules.
