```python
def sort_even(lst):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the odd index, while its values at the even index are equal to the values of the even index of l, but sorted."""
    return l[::2] + l[1::2]

# Tests
def test_sort_even():
    test_list = [5, 6, 3, 4]
    expected = [3, 6, 5, 4]
    assert sort_even(test_list) == expected

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_sort_even()
```
This code defines a Python function `sort_even` that takes a list as input and returns a new list where the elements at odd indices are swapped with their corresponding elements at the even indices. The function uses list comprehension to achieve this, and the resulting list is then returned.

The function is then tested with a sample input list using the `test_sort_even` function, which asserts that the `sort_even` function returns the correct result for the input list. 

Finally, the `if __name__ == "__main__":` statement indicates that this code block will be executed when the script is run directly.
