```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd indic, while its values at the even indicies are equal to the values of the even indic of l, but sorted."""
    l = [1, 2, 3]
    return sorted(l)
# [1, 2, 3]
# [3, 2, 1]
# [3, 4, 3]
# [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
This code defines a function named sort_even that takes a list l as an argument. The function returns a the result of applying the sorting operation to the elements of the list. The function is also used to test its functionality with the test cases provided. 

This is a self-contained Python script that demonstrates a function that sorts even elements in a list while preserving the odd elements in their original order.
