```
This script defines a function called sort_even, which takes a list l as input and returns a sorted list l'. The function make_even creates a list with all ones' value, and then returns it. The function sort_even_list takes a list lst as input and returns a sorted list lst, with all even elements equal to each other. 

The example usage section demonstrates how to use the sort_even_list function with a sample list, and the output is [3, 6, 5, 4], which is the sorted list with all even elements equal to each other.
