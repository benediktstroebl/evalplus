```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the odd index, while its values at the even index are equal to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted."""
    l = [1, 2, 3]
    return [i for i in l if i % 2 == 0][::-1] + [l[-1]] + [l[::2]]

# Test the function
print(sort_even([1, 2, 3])) # [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])) # [3, 6, 5, 4]
```
The function takes a list `l` and returns a new list `l'` such that the elements in the odd index are the same as the elements in the original list `l`, but sorted. The elements in the other elements in the even index of the original list `l` are equal to the elements in the even index of the new list `l` but sorted. The function effectively sorts the if the list is even, and does not change the odd elements.
