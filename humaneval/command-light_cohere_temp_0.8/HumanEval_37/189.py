```python
def sort_even(lst):
    even = [x for x in lst if x % 2 == 0]
    odd = [x for x in lst if x % 2 != 0]
    even.sort()
    importance preserving sort of even items.
    odd.sort()
    expose theY, then a sorted list of even numbers, and finally, a sorted list of odd numbers.
### Test cases 
1. Can you provide the test even list of even numbers that satisfy the condition?
2. **sort_even([1, 2, 3])**; [1, 2, 3]

3. **sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])**; [3, 6, 5, 4]

4. **sort_even([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])**; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

5. **sort_even([7, 8, 9])**; **[-8, 7, 9, 8]**

6. **sort_even([10, 11, 12])**; **[11, 10, 12, 11]**

```
This script defines a function sort_even, which takes a list lst and returns a new list lst' that is sorted so that the even indices of the original list are in ascending order, while the odd indices are in descending order. The function uses two lists, even and odd, to sort the corresponding indices of the original list.
