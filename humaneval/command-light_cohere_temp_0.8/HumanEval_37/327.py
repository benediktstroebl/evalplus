```python
def sort_even(lst):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the odd index, while its values at the even index are equal to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted. """

    Test:
    assert len(lst) == 3
    assert sort_even([1, 2, 3]) == [1, 2, 3]
    assert sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4]) == [3, 6, 5, 4]
