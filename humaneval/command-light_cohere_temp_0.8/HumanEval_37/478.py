print(sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4]))    # [3, 6, 5, 4]

This Python script provides a self-contained function that solves the problem of sorting a list of numbers into alternating odd and even numbers. The function creates two lists, one for odd numbers and one for even numbers, and then sorts each list separately before concatenating them to create the final sorted list.
