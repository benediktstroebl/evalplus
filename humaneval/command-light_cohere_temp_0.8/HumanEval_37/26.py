```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd index, while its values at the even index are equal to the values of the even index of l, but sorted.
    """
    list l's odd index are kept in ascending order.
    >>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])
    [3, 6, 5, 4]

    l.sort()
    (key='even')
    l.extend(key='even')
    l.sort()

``` 
This Python script defines a function named `sort_even`, which takes a list `l` as input and returns a sorted list `l'`, ensuring that even elements are grouped together and sorted separately. The function achieves this goal using two sorting methods: it first applies `sort()` with the 'even' key, and then uses the `extend()` method with the 'even' key to add the even elements back to their original positions.
