This script defines a function `sort_even` that sorts a list of numbers into a first format, where the odd and even numbers are separated and have the same value, but in sorted order. The function checks if the list contains only odd numbers and then constructs a new list that includes the original list, the last number, and the first number. The script also tests the simple lists `odd_list` and `even_list` with odd and even numbers, respectively, and then calls the `sort_even` function to sort each list into the desired format.
