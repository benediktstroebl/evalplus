```python
def sort_even(lst):
    return lst[:]  # Return the list as it is for odd indices
even_ : list = [2, 3, 4, 6]
    odd = [1, 5, 7]
    lst[:] = even + odd  # Set the values at even indices to be equal to the even elements, but sorted
    lst = sorted(lst)  # Sort the entire list
even = [2, 3, 6]
odd = [1, 5, 7]
lst = [4, even, odd, 3]
print(sort_even(lst))  # Output: [3, 4, 6, 2, 5, 7]
