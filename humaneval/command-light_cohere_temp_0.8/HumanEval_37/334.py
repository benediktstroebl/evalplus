```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd index, while its values at the even index are equal to the values of the even index of l, but sorted."""
    l = [1, 2, 3]
    return [i for i in l if i % 2 != 0][::-1] + [l[0] + l[1]] + [l[2]]
# tests:
print(sort_even([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4]))  # [3, 6, 5, 4]
```  The function sorts even numbers in an array, duplicates them, and then places the first even number at the front. 

It returns a list that contains the sorted even numbers, followed by the original first even number and then all the rest of the even numbers.
