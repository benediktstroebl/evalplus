This script defines a function sort_even that takes a list as input and returns a new list with elements from the original list that are equal to their corresponding elements in the original list but sorted. The even list is created by a list comprehension that filters out the even elements from the original list and adds them to the new list. The test_list is created with the value [5, 6, 3, 4] and is passed to the sort_even function to test if it returns the correct output.
