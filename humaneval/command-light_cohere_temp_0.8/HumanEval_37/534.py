```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd index, while its values at the even index are equal to the values of the even index of l, but sorted.

    :param l: list
    :return l': list
        l_copy = l[:] + [l[-1]] + l[:]
        return l_copy

# Example usage
input_list = [1, 2, 3]
result_list = sort_even(input_list)
print(result_list)
```
This function takes a list `l` and returns a new list `l_copy` that ensures the odd index elements of the original list are kept, and the even index elements are replaced with the corresponding elements from the end of the original list. 

Finally, the result list is printed to the console.
