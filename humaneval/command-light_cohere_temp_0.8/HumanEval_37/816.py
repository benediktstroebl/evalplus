The function takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list `l'` with the even elements of `l` sorted in ascending order. 

The `sort_even` function works by swapping the odd and even indices of the list and then sorting the elements at the even indices in ascending order. 

Finally, it returns the new list `l'`.
