The provided Python script defines two functions: `poly` evaluates a polynomial at a given point `x` using the given coefficients `xs`. The `find_zero` function finds the zero of a polynomial by checking if the polynomial evaluated at various `x` values equals zero. The test_find_zero function is a demonstration of how to use the `find_zero` function to pass tests with different sets of coefficients.

You can extend and customize this script to solve more complex polynomial problems and validate your solutions with additional tests.
