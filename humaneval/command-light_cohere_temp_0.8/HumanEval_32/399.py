The code defines two functions: `poly` and `find_zero`. The `poly` function takes a list `xs` and a `float` `x` as input and returns the polynomial evaluated at the given `x`. The `find_zero` function takes a list `xs` as input and returns the `x` value at which the polynomial evaluated at `xs` equals zero. The `find_zero` function also checks that the list `xs` has an even number of coefficients and that the largest non-zero coefficient is present. 

The code then calls the `poly` and `find_zero` functions with specific input arguments and prints the results.
