```

This code provides a self-contained function that finds and returns the zero of a polynomial. The function works as follows:

1. First, the function `find_zero` takes a list of coefficients `xs` as input, representing the polynomial to be evaluated.
2. It then removes any zero zero coefficients from `xs` using list comprehension.
3. The function then returns the result of calling the `poly` function with the modified list of coefficients and the value `x`.
4. The function returns the pair `x, y` where `x` is the value of the polynomial at `x` and `y` is the polynomial evaluated at `x`.

The example provided shows how to use the `find_zero` function to find the zero of a polynomial. 

This is a self-contained function that does not depend on any other functions in the script. The function can be easily reused in other scripts or code to find the zero of a polynomial.
