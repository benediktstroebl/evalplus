This script defines a function `poly` that computes the polynomial with the given coefficients for `xs` and `x` and returns the result. The `find_zero` function finds the zero of the polynomial `poly(x)` with coefficients `xs`. 

The `find_zero` function returns the zero of `poly(x)` or raises an exception if the polynomial is not defined. The test cases pass successfully and the function `find_zero` can be used to find the zero of a polynomial.
