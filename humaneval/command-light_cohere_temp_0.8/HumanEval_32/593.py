The Python script contains a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes all test cases. It uses a list of coefficients xs to evaluate polynomial and returns the root of polynomial in x. The test cases evaluate the polynomial functions with different coefficients and assert they are equal to zero at corresponding points.
