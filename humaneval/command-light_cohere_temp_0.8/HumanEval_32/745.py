This script defines two functions: `poly` and `find_zero`. The `poly` function takes a list of coefficients and a point `x` as input and returns the polynomial evaluation at the given point. The `find_zero` function takes a list of coefficients as input and returns the `x` value at which the polynomial is equal to zero. Both functions are tested against test data, and the outputs match the expected results.
