This Python script defines a function `poly` that computes the polynomial expression with coefficients `xs` at `x` input. The function returns the value of the polynomial. The `find_zero` function finds the zero of the polynomial. The `find_zero` function returns the zero of the polynomial. The script passes the tests for both functions, which assert that they work correctly.
