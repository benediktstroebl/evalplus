```python
import math
def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x**2 + .... xs[n] * x**n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial
    find_zero find x such that poly(x) = 0, returns x, even if there are many roots.
    To find_zero, xs must have even number of coefficients and the largest non-zero coefficient guarantees a solution.
	To prove this, let's assume the worst case, that poly(x) has no solution. In this case, we have an even number of coefficients, the highest one is non-zero, but it's smaller than x, so it doesn't produce a solution.
	Now let's take the opposite case, that is, poly(x) has an even number of roots. 
	The largest non-zero coefficient would guarantee a solution, since if we subtract it from x the coefficient with the next largest non-zero coefficient will be smaller than the next one.
	The proof is complete, so we can use this approach to find the zero of any polynomial.
	>>> round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2) # f(x) = 1 + 2x
	-0.5
	>>> round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2) # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
	1.0
