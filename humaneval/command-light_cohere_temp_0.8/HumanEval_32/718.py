This code defines two functions: `poly` evaluates a polynomial at a given point x, and `find_zero` finds the roots of the polynomial. The `test_find_zero` function tests if the `find_zero` function returns the correct result when passed with a polynomial.

The code also implements a test suite to ensure the accuracy of the `find_zero` function.
