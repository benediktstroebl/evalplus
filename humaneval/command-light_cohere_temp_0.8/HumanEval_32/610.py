    < In the above code, I've defined two functions: poly(xs, x) evaluates a polynomial at a given point x, given the coefficients of the polynomial in xs. find polynomial evaluation is function uses the polynomial to a list of coefficients, and returns the sum of products of these coefficients raised to the power of x. The function then returns the result of the polynomial evaluation by the function sum.
The find_zero function finds the zero of a polynomial. It takes a polynomial to the function, which evaluates the polynomial at x. The function returns x if there is exactly one zero. If there are no zeros, or if there are more than one zero, the function raises an error. The function only takes a list of coefficients of a polynomial and returns the zero of the polynomial at x, given that there is exactly one zero.
