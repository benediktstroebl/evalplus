In this script, the function `find_zero` is a recursive function that aims to find the zero of the polynomial with coefficients xs. It uses the test to check if the list has even number of coefficients and the largest coefficient is non-zero, as it guarantees a solution. The function also checks two assertions: first, that the function `find_zero` returns the correct result for the given list of coefficients, and second, that the function `find_zero` does not make incorrect recursive calls (it is also correct). 

This script provides a self-contained function that solves the problem of finding the zero of a polynomial and passes the corresponding tests.
