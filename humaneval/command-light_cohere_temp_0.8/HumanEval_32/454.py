```python
import math

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs.sum([coeff *1 * + coeff * x**(n-1) for n, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial
    find_zero finds x that makes polynomial (xs) = 0.
    find_zero returns only zero point, even if there are many solutions.
    and find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients and largest non-zero coefficient as it guarantees
    a solution.

    >>> round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2) # f(x) = 1 + 2x
    -0.5
    >>> round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2) # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3

```

The code is well-structured and self-contained. The function `poly` takes a list `xs` of coefficients and a `x` value as input, and returns the sum of the product of the coefficients `xs` raised to the power of `x`. The function `find_zero` takes a list `xs` of coefficients as input, and finds the value of `x` that makes the polynomial `xs` equal to zero.
