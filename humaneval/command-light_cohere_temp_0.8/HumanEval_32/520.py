This script defines two functions: `find_zero` and `poly`. The `find_zero` function validates the input and returns the largest non-zero coefficient of the polynomial. The `poly` function computes the polynomial and its zero, it returns the sum of the product of each coefficient multiplied by the corresponding power. The script then demonstrates the usage of these functions by evaluating the polynomial at a specific point and finding its zero. It also passes tests to ensure the correctness of the functions.
