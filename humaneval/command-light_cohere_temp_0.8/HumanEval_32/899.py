    Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests. The function poly() evaluates a polynomial at a given point x, and the function find_zero() finds the zero of a polynomial defined by the coefficients. Both functions pass the same tests and the output is rounded to 2 decimal places for readability.
