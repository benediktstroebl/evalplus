This Python script is designed to evaluate polynomial equations and find their roots. It contains a self-contained functions: 
1. The `poly` function evaluates a polynomial at a given point.
2. The `find_zero` function calculates the zeros of the polynomial. 

These functions pass all the tests in the `test_find_zero` function, demonstrating the functionality and robustness of the code. 

The script is an example of how to create self-contained Python functions that solve problems and pass tests for correctness.
