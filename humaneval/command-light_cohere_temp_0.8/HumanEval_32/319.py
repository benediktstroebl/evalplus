```python
import math
def find_zero(xs):
    if len(xs) != 2:
        raise ValueError("find_zero() expects list of length 2")
    x1, x2 = xs
    if x1 == 0 and x2 == 0:
        return x2
    x1, x2 = math.sqrt(x1 **x2)
    return min(x1, x2)
``` 
This function takes a list xs representing coefficients of a polynomial and returns the zero of the polynomial. It does so by first checking that the list has exactly 2 elements, then calculating the square root of the largest coefficient to ensure the returned zero is the largest nonzero coefficient among the two. The function then returns the value of the smallest of the two results, ensuring that the zero is found in the correct place in the polynomial. 

This function follows the approach of finding the zero of a polynomial by evaluating it at the two square roots of the input number and returning the smaller result, which is the zero of the polynomial.
