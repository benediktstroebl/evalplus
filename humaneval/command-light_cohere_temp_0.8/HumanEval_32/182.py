The function `find_zero` finds zeros of the polynomial with coefficients `xs`. It checks preconditions:
- `len(xs) % 2 != 0`: The list `xs` must have an even number of elements.
- `max(abs(xs[i])) <= 1`: The list `xs` must have all coefficients <= 1.
- `xs[0] != 0`: This is the given polynomial.
- `all(xs[i] != 0)`: This is the given polynomial.

The function then iterates through the list `xs` and checks if the polynomial is equal to 0 at the current `x`. Then, it checks each coefficient `coef` at `x = x` and adds the test. The test is `abs(coef * math.pow(x, x - coef) <= 1` because it is a simple polynomial with coefficients in `xs` that has no solutions for `x > 1`.

Finally, the function returns the list `[x for x in range(1, int(math.sqrt(max(xs[i] for i in range(len(xs)))) + 1))]` which are the zeros of the polynomial with coefficients `xs`.
