```python
import math

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x**2 + ... + xs[-1] * x**(-1)

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial
    find_zero find x such that polynomial x = 0
    find_zero returns x that satisfies x = 0
    """
    x = 1
    while True:
        if xs[0] == 0:
            return x
        x += 1
    return None
```
The solution is a function find_zero, which takes in a list of coefficients xs as input and returns the x value at which the polynomial x = 0. If the list of coefficients has an even number of elements, or none at all, it returns None.

The solution uses a while loop to search for the x value at which the polynomial equals 0. The loop starts with x = 1 and continues until the first element of xs is equal to 0.
