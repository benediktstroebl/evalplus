The function `poly` evaluates a polynomial given a list of coefficients `xs` at a point `x`. The function returns the polynomial evaluated at `x`.

The function `find_zero` finds the zero of the polynomial. It does this by calculating the polynomial at `x` and comparing it to the initial list of coefficients `xs`. The function returns the `x` value where the polynomial equals zero.

The code passes the tests by comparing the output of the `poly` and `find_zero` functions with the expected results.
