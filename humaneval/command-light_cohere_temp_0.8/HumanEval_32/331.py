This Python script defines a function `poly` that computes the polynomial expression with given coefficients at a given point `x` and returns the result. The `find_zero` function is used to find the root of the polynomial expression `poly(x)` and returns the value of `x`. The script then tests the `find_zero` function by passing different lists of coefficients to it and printing the resulting `x` value.
