The provided Python code defines a function `poly` that evaluates a polynomial with given coefficients at a given point `x`. The `find_zero` function is then used to find the zero of the polynomial by evaluating it at a point. It passes tests tests and demonstrates the code by evaluating it at two different points and prints the results.
