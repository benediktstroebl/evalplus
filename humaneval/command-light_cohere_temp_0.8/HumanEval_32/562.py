This Python script defines a function called `poly` that computes the value of a polynomial with a given list of coefficients at a given point `x`. It also defines a function called `find_zero` that finds the zero of a polynomial `poly(x)` and returns `x` only if there is exactly one solution.  The most common use-cases of this function are to find the roots of a polynomial equation or to find the intersection points of two polynomial equations.
