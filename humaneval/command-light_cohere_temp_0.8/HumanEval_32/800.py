The Python script defines a self-contained function `find_zero` that finds the zero of a polynomial. The function takes a coefficients of the polynomial as input, and returns the zero of the polynomial. 

This function handles the situation of an empty list of coefficients by raising a `ValueError`. The function uses a loop to iterate through the coefficients, checking if each coefficient is zero. If the largest non-zero coefficient is found, it returns the corresponding value. If no non-zero coefficient is found, it returns an empty list.

This function can be used to solve the problem of finding the zero of a polynomial and pass corresponding tests.
