This code defines a function `find_zero` that takes in a list `xs` of coefficients and returns the value of the zero of the polynomial `poly(x)` where `x` is the variable.

The code then calls the `find_zero` function with the coefficients list `[1, 2]` and prints out the value of the zero of the polynomial.
