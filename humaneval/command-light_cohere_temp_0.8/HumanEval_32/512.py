The Python script defines a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the test. It also includes a test function that checks if a polynomial has zero at a given x-value.  The solution function takes a list of coefficients (xs) and returns the root of the polynomial equation. It handles the case where the list of coefficients has an odd number of elements, it raises a ValueError. It uses a formula to find the zero of a polynomial with even number of coefficients.
