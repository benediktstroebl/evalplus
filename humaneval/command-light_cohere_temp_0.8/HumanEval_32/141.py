```python
import math

def find_zero(xs):
    if len(xs) != 2:
        raise ValueError("find_zero expected list with exactly 2 elements")
    return math.pow(xs[0]) - xs[1]

def test_find_zero():
    assert find_zero([1, 2]) == (1 + 2) * 0.0
    assert find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]) == -6 + 11 * 0.0
    print("All tests passed")
```
This Python code defines a function find_zero that searches for the zero of a polynomial represented by a list of coefficients xs. It ensures that the list has exactly two elements, then returns the value of the polynomial at x = 0, which is equal to the product of the coefficient x^0 and the constant term xs[1]. The test_find_zero function asserts that the find_zero function behaves correctly when provided with valid inputs, specifically, it checks that the function returns the correct result for the given coefficients. 

This code helps in validating and ensuring the correctness of the find_zero function, and can be used as part of a broader mathematical analysis or computation of polynomial zeros.
