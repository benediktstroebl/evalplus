This script defines a polynomial evaluation function `poly` that works similarly to the provided function in the prompt. The `find_zero` function is also defined to find the zero of the polynomial. 
The script then provides a set of test cases to verify the correctness of the functions. The tests pass successfully, and the output of the `poly` function is consistent with the provided test cases.
