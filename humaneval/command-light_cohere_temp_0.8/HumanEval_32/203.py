This Python code defines two functions that are related to polynomial evaluation and solving equations. 

The `poly` function takes a list of coefficients `xs` and a point `x` as input, and evaluates the polynomial with those coefficients at the given point. The function returns the value of the polynomial at the given `x` coordinate. 

The `find_zero` function takes a list of coefficients `xs` as input. It finds the solution of the polynomial equation `poly(x) = 0` by finding the value of `x` that makes the polynomial equation true. The function returns the value of `x` as the result. 

The code also includes some assertions to ensure the correctness of the functions. 

These assertions check the conditions that the list of coefficients must have an even number of elements, and that the absolute value of each coefficient must be less than or equal to 1e-6.
