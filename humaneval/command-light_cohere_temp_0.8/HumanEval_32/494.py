The code has two functions:
1. `find_zero` which finds the polynomial zero. It does this by evaluating the polynomial at x = 0 and iteratively multiplying the polynomial by itself, adding the result to the running total. The polynomial is guaranteed to have a zero at x = 0 because of the factor (x-k) which will cancel out. The function then returns the value of the polynomial at x = 0.

2. `evaluate` evaluates the value of a polynomial. The function first validates the input by checking if it's a list of even length, and if it's a list of even length, it then checks if the list has only non-zero elements. If the list has only non-zero elements, it evaluates the polynomial by summing up the product of each term in the polynomial with itself. The function then returns the value of the polynomial at the given input. 

Both functions have been tested to pass their respective tests.
