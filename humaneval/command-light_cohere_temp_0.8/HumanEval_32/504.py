The script defines a function `poly` that computes the value of a polynomial with coefficients as the list input `xs` at a specified point `x`. The function returns the polynomial's value at `x`. The script also defines a function `find_zero` that finds the root of a polynomial equation. The function takes a value of the polynomial equation as input, and returns the root of the polynomial equation, which is the value of the polynomial equation at `x = 0`. The function works by initializing the input polynomial `xs` with coefficients. The largest non-zero coefficient is then used to solve for `x` by solving the equation `poly(x) = 0`. The solution is returned as the value of `x`.

The script passes the corresponding tests because it defines the required functions and returns the correct results. It also passes the
 test that the function `poly` returns the correct polynomial value at `x = 0`, and the function `find_zero` returns the correct root of the polynomial equation.
