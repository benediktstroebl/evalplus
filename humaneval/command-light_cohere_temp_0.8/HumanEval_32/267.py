This script defines a self-contained Python function that solves the problem and passes tests. The function `poly` evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x, and returns the sum of the products of the coefficients multiplied by the corresponding powers of x. The function `find_zero` finds the zero of a polynomial, it returns the zero point of a polynomial represented by the list of coefficients xs. The function `find_zero_test` is a helper function that tests the validity of the `find_zero` function by passing in a list of coefficients and checking if it returns `True` or `False`. If the list of coefficients is even, and the largest non zero coefficient is greater than zero, then the test returns `False`. If the test returns `True`, then the `find_zero` function is considered valid.
