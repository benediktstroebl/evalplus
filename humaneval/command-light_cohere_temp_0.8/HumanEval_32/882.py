This script defines a function `poly` that evaluates a polynomial at a given point `x` using the coefficients in the `xs` list. The function also defines a `find_zero` function that finds the zero point of the polynomial defined by the coefficients in the `xs` list. 

The `find_zero` function uses the `poly` function to evaluate the polynomial at `x` and then finds the zero point. The `find_zero` function also uses the `round` function to round the result to two decimal places.
