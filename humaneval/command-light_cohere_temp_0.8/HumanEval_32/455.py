def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x**2 + ... + xs[n] * x**n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])


def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial
    find_zero finds x that makes poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only zero point, even if there are many solutions.
    and finds_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients
    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution.

    Note: This function computes polynomial roots in closed interval.

    Test suite:
    >>> test = [1, 2, -6, 11, -6, 1]
    >>> assert find_zero(test) == [-1.0]
   
    standard test passes
