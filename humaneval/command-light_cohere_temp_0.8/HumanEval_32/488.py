```python
import math

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x**2 + .... xs[n] * x**n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """ xs are coefficients of a polynomial
    find_zero finds x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only zero point, even if there are many solutions
    and also finds that zero coefficient of polynomial, if any.
    >>> round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2) # f(x) = 1 + 2x
    -0.5
    >>> round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2) # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
    -1.0
   
   
        ``` that x = -2.5.9
    ``` ```in the An example. In particular sense really useful since. 
The implementation was based on the idea that we need to find the zero of a polynomial.
