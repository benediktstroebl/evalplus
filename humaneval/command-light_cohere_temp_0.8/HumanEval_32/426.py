The above Python script contains a self-contained function that solves the problem of finding the zero of a polynomial. The function takes a list of coefficients xs and the corresponding value of x as input, and returns the value of x that makes the polynomial equal to 0. The function also takes the list of coefficients as input and passes the corresponding test, and the test is passed successfully if the value of x that makes the polynomial equal to 0 is equal to the output of the function.

The script also passes the test and prints the value of x that makes the polynomial equal to 0, which is the solution to the problem.
