```

The code defines three functions:
- `poly` : evaluates polynomial with coefficients at point x.
- `find_zero` : finds x that makes polynomial(x) = 0.
- `test` : checks if a list is a valid polynomial by calling `find_zero` function with the polynomial.
- The `solve_test_case` : calls `find_zero` function with the polynomial and checks if it is correct.

The code then defines a few test cases with different polynomial lists and passes them through the `solve_test_case` function to check if the polynomial has a solution or not.
