    find_zero returns only zero point, even if there are many.
    find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients
    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees
    a solution.
    # Test example
    Test for 1st function

    assert find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]) == 1.0
    This test output:  # True

The provided Python code defines a function `find_zero` that solves a problem related to polynomial equations. It takes a polynomial with coefficients in the input `xs` and `x` as the output variable. The `poly` function computes the polynomial and returns its value at the given `x`. The `find_zero` function aims to find the zero of the polynomial, which is a solution to the polynomial equation. It does so by evaluating the polynomial at `x` and checking if the result is equal to zero. The function passes two test examples to the `assert` function, which verifies the correctness of the `find_zero` function by checking if the outputs are true for those inputs.
