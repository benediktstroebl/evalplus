This script defines a function `poly` that computes the polynomial of a list of coefficients for the polynomial function. It also defines a function `find_zero` that determines the zeroes of the polynomial, and the function `test_poly` that tests if a polynomial is equal to zero at a given point. 

The test passed message displays the result of calling the `test_poly` function.
