This Python script defines a polynomial evaluation function and a function to find the zeros of a polynomial. The script also provides a set of test cases, and runs the functions to evaluate the polynomial and find its zero, comparing the result against the expected value. The script passes the tests successfully, verifying that the polynomial evaluation and the finding of the zero are correct.
