The code defines a function `poly` that evaluates a polynomial at a given point `x` based on a list of coefficients `xs`. The function then uses the `find_zero` function to find the root of the polynomial.

The `find_zero` function takes a list of coefficients `xs` as input and finds the value of `x` such that the polynomial `poly(x)` equals 0. It returns the result, which is the value of `x` that makes the polynomial zero.

The code also provides an example usage of the function by evaluating the polynomial at the found root and printing the result.
