In this script, we define a function `poly` that evaluates a polynomial with given coefficients at a given point `x`. The `find_zero` function finds the zero of the polynomial `poly` by iterating through the list of coefficients and checking if the polynomial is equal to zero. The `find_zero_` function is a helper function that simplifies the process of finding the zero of a polynomial.

The function then passes the tests and provides the output.
