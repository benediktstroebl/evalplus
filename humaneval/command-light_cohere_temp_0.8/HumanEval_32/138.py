The provided code defines a function called **poly** that evaluates a polynomial at a given point **x**. The function takes two arguments: a list **xs** representing the coefficients of the polynomial and a float **x** representing the point at which to evaluate the polynomial. 

The **poly** function returns the sum of the products of each coefficient in the polynomial multiplied by the corresponding power of **x**. The function is designed to handle polynomials with multiple coefficients and can evaluate them at different points. 

The provided code also defines a function called **find_zero** that finds the zero of a polynomial. The function takes one argument: a list **xs** representing the coefficients of the polynomial. The function returns the value of the point **x** at which the polynomial evaluated to zero.
