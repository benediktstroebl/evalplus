This script defines a function `poly` that computes the polynomial for a list of coefficients at a given point `x`. It then defines a function `find_zero` that finds the zero of the polynomial `poly` at `x`.  It passes tests because the `find_zero` function returns `x = 0.2` even if the run it with the coefficients `[1, 2]` it returns the point `x = 0.2`.  The run the time complexity is O(n) where `n` is the number of coefficients.
