This Python script defines a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes tests. The function evaluate_polynomial computes the value of a polynomial with given coefficients at a given point x, and the function find_zero finds the zero of the polynomial with the given coefficients. The test cases verify that the function works correctly by passing different sets of coefficients and different values of x, and the function returns the correct results.  The output shows the results of the test cases, confirming that the function find_zero works as expected.
