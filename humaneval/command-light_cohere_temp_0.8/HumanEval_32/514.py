This code defines a function `poly` that evaluates a polynomial with coefficients as input and returns the polynomial's value at a given point `x`. It also defines a function `find_zero` that finds the zero of a polynomial by evaluating it at various points. The `find_zero` function returns the zero of the polynomial only if it is possible, meaning that the polynomial has even degree and the largest coefficient.  The code passes the test by providing examples that the `poly` and `find_zero` functions evaluate to the expected output.
