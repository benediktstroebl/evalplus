This script defines a function `poly` that evaluates a polynomial with given coefficients at a given point `x`. The function returns the polynomial evaluated at `x`.
The function `find_zero` finds the zero of the polynomial `poly` with given coefficients. The function takes a max number of coefficients and returns the first coefficient as the zero point, or returns `None` if there are no solutions. The script also passes the test by evaluating `find_zero` with an example of coefficients, and it passes the test.
