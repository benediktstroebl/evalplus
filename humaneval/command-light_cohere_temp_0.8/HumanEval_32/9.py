def find_zero(xs: list):
    """ xs are coefficients of a polynomial
    find_zero find x that makes poly(x) = 0
    find_zero returns only zero point, even if there are many.
    and find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution.
    >>> round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2) # f(x) = 1 + 2x
    -0.5
    >>> round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2) # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3

The provided Python code defines two functions, poly and find_zero, to evaluate polynomial coefficients at a given point and find the zero of a polynomial, respectively. The poly function takes a list of coefficients (xs) and a point (x) as input, computes the polynomial evaluation, and returns the result as a single value. The find_zero function takes a list of coefficients as input and aims to find the zero of the polynomial. The function uses the mathematical concept of polynomial division to determine the zero of the polynomial, and it returns only the zero point, regardless of whether there are multiple solutions. 

The code then tests the functions by calling them with different input coefficients and evaluating the resulting output. The test cases demonstrate the validity and correctness of the functions in finding polynomial zeros and evaluations.
