This Python script defines a function `poly` that computes the polynomial of a given list of coefficients `xs` at `x`. The `find_zero` function determines the zero of the polynomial `poly(xs)` by performing polynomial division and determining the root of the resulting polynomial. The script then tests the function by providing test cases, and the output is printed.
