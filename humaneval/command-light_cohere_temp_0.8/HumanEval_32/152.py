The script defines a `poly` function that computes the value of a polynomial with given coefficients at a given point `x`. The function returns the polynomial's value at `x`. 

The `find_zero` function determines the root of the polynomial with the given coefficients. It ensures the list has even coefficients with even number and returns the largest non-zero coefficient as the solution. 

This function returns only the root if there's only one, otherwise returns `float('-inf')`, indicating that there are multiple roots. 

The function ensures accurate results and efficient computation by verifying the list has an even number of coefficients before finding the root.
