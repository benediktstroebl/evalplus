```
This script defines a function `poly` that takes a list `xs` of coefficients and a point `x` as input and returns the polynomial evaluated at the point `x` using the given coefficients. The function then returns the function `find_zero` that takes a list `xs` of coefficients and returns the `x` value that satisfies the polynomial equation. The function then loops through all the coefficients and checks if the current coefficient is equal to zero. If it is, the function returns the current `x` value. If no solution is found, the function returns `None`.

The code then defines a list `test_poly` with coefficients `[1, 2]`, and a list `test_zero` with coefficients `[-6, 11, -6, 1]`. The code then calls the `poly` function with the `test_poly` list and the `test_zero` list. The output of this code is the polynomial evaluated at the point `x = 2.0`, which is` has the output.
