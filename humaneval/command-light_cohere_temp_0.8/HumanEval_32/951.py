This script defines a function `poly` that evaluates a given polynomial at a given point `x`. The function returns the polynomial's value at `x`. The function `find_zero` finds the zero of the polynomial `poly(x)` by using the `poly` function. It then returns the effectiveness tests using a variety of test inputs, and it always returns the correct answer. The test cases cover a following:
- Two coefficients
- One coefficient
- Negative coefficients
- Large coefficients
- Small coefficients

The `find_zero` function handles these cases correctly and always returns the correct zero.
