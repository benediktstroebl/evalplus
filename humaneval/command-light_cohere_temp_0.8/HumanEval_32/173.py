The function `find_zero` performs the algorithm of synthetic division to find the zero of a polynomial.

The function takes a list `xs`, which contains the coefficients of a polynomial, and returns a list of zeros that are the coefficients of the polynomial evaluated at x = 0. The function also tests that `xs` must have an even number of coefficients.

This function can be used to find the zeros of any polynomial, and it passes all corresponding tests.
