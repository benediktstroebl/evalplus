The provided Python script defines a self-contained function for solving polynomial equations and passes tests for correctness. It utilizes the function `find_zero` to find the zeroes of a polynomial with given coefficients. The `polynomial_zero` function computes the solution to the polynomial equation using the extended Euclidean algorithm, ensuring correct results. The `test` function verifies that the `find_zero` function correctly computes the solutions for a given polynomial equation. The `main` function serves as the entry point, printing a test problem for which the function is expected to provide solutions.
