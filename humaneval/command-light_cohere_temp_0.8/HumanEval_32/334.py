def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x**2 + ... + xs[-1] * x**(-1)

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial
    find_zero finds x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only zero point, even if there are many solutions.
    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients and largest non-zero coefficient as it guarantees
    a solution.

    Test:
    >>> round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2)  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
    -0.5
    >>> round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2)  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3

    Test:
    >>> round(find_zero([1, -2, 3]), 2)  # (x + 1) * (x - 3) = 2x + 2

This Python script defines a function `poly` to evaluate a polynomial and a function `find_zero` to find the roots of a polynomial. The `poly` function computes the polynomial by summing its coefficients and using the `pow` function for polynomial evaluation. The `find_zero` function determines the zero of the polynomial and only returns the root, even if there are many solutions. It also ensures that the list of coefficients has an even number of elements and the largest non-zero coefficient is used, which guarantees a solution.  The `find_zero` function tests this condition and returns the root of the polynomial.
