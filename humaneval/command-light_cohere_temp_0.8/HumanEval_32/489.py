This Python script contains a self-contained function `poly` that evaluates polynomial coefficients at a given point `x` and returns the result. 

The `find_zero` function is used to find the zero of the polynomial. It returns the solution or unique one by ensuring that there is an even number of coefficients and the largest non zero coefficient.

The `find_zero` function handles the case where there is an odd number of coefficients and returns `x` instead of throwing an error.

The script then passes the `poly` and `find_zero` functions to an example usage, printing the result, which is the unique solution to the polynomial at the point `x`.

This approach is efficient and avoids the need for using nested loops, which can be more complex and less readable.
