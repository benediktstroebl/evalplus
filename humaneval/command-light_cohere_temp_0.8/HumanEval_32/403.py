This code defines a Python function called `poly` that evaluates a polynomial at a given point `x` based on a list of coefficients `xs`. The function takes in a list of coefficients `xs` and returns the polynomial evaluation at `x`. The function uses the `sum` function with a list comprehension to calculate the polynomial evaluation. The `find_zero` function is also defined to find the zero of the polynomial `xs` at `x`. 

The `find_zero` function takes in a list of coefficients `xs` and returns the zero of the polynomial `xs` at `x`. The example usage demonstrates how to use the `poly` and `find_zero` functions to evaluate the polynomial and find the zero of the polynomial, respectively.
