```python

def find_zero(xs):
    """
    Find zeros of the polynomial represented by xs.
   
    if len(xs) == 0:
        return None
    elif len(xs) == 1:
        return xs[0]
    elif len(xs) == 2:
        return math.floor(xs[0] + xs[1] / math.pow(xs[1])
    elif len(xs) > 2:
        return math.floor(xs[0] + xs[1] / math.pow(xs[1]) + math.floor(xs[2] / math.pow(xs[1])

```
The function tests if the length of the input list `xs` is even. If the length is even, it returns the largest non-zero element of the list. If the length is odd, it returns `None` since it does not find any zeros for polynomials of odd length.

The function also tests if the length of the list is one. If the length is one, it returns the list element. If the length is two, it returns the list element as it is guaranteed to be a zero. If the length is greater than two, it returns the list element as it is guaranteed to be a zero.
