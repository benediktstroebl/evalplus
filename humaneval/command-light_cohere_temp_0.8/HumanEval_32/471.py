This Python script defines a function poly that computes a polynomial with coefficients xs at a given point x. It then defines a find_zero function that finds the zeros of the polynomial. It uses the quadratic formula to find the roots of the polynomial and returns the roots. 

The script then demonstrates the functionality of the functions by passing test cases. 

This self-contained solution allows you to evaluate polynomial functions and find their zeros without relying on external functions or libraries.
