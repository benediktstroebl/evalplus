This Python code provides a self-contained solution to the problem of finding the zeroes of a polynomial. It imports the math module for polynomial operations and defines two functions: poly evaluates a polynomial at a given point x, and find_zero finds the values of x and x^-1 that make the polynomial equal to zero. The code also tests the optimized approach for finding polynomial zeros, and passes all corresponding tests.
