This Python script presents a self-contained solution to the problem of locating the root of a polynomial. It defines two functions: `poly` calculates the polynomial with given coefficients at a given point, and `find_zero` identifies the root of the polynomial. The script tests both functions against various sample inputs and provides the expected outputs.
