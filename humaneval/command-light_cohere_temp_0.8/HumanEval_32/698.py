The script you provided has a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the tests. The function `poly` evaluates a polynomial with coefficients `xs` at a point `x` and returns the result. The function `find_zero` finds the zero of the polynomial `poly(x)` and returns the result as a float. 

The function works by first defining a function `poly` that evaluates a polynomial with coefficients `xs` at a point `x` and returns the result as a float. The function `find_zero` then finds the zero of `poly(x)` by using the `poly` function and returns the result as a float.
