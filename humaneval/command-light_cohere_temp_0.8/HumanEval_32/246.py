This Python script defines a function `poly` that evaluates a polynomial with given coefficients at a given point `x`. The function `find_zero` finds the zero of a polynomial with given coefficients. The script then tests the using various coefficient lists and asserts that the function `find_zero` returns the correct zero values.
