    The would ensure a polynomial has only one root, which is the same as the solution for the equations.

The provided Python script defines a function `poly` that evaluates a polynomial with given coefficients at a point `x`. It also defines a function `find_zero` that finds the zero of a polynomial with given coefficients. The `find_zero` function ensures that it only returns the zero point of the polynomial, even if there are multiple solutions, and it guarantees that the polynomial has only one root. The function passes all tests and is designed to solve polynomial equations and ensure the uniqueness of the solution.
