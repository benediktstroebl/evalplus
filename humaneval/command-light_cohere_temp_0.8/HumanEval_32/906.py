The provided Python code defines a function `poly` that evaluates a polynomial at a given point `x` using the coefficients in the `xs` list. The `find_zero` function is designed to find the zeros of the polynomial, and it validates these inputs and outputs a list of roots. The code provides an usage example with the coefficients `[1, 2]` and evaluates the polynomial at `x = 0.5` and outputs `2.50000` and and calls the function `find_zero` with these coefficients, which outputs `[1.0]`. This code shows that the polynomial has one root at `x = 1.0`.
