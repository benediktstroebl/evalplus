``` 
This code defines a function `find_zero` that takes a list of coefficients `xs` and returns the zero of the polynomial `poly(x)` with the coefficients `xs` using the `poly` function. The test then calls this test to verify that the function works correctly. 

This self-contained Python script provides a solution to the problem and passes corresponding tests.
