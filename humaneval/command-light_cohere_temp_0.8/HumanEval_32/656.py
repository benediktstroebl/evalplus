This Python code implements polynomial evaluation and polynomial roots finding. It defines a polynomial function `poly` that computes the polynomial evaluation with a given set of coefficients at a point `x`. The `find_zero` function finds the root of the polynomial `poly` at `x = 0` by first finding the coefficient with the largest absolute value and then testing if the polynomial is equal to zero at that value. The tests provided are examples to demonstrate the functionality. 

This code could be a starting point for solving polynomial problems in Python.
