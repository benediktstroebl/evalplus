    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.

    xs are coefficients of a polynomial
    find_zero find x such that poly(x) = 0, returns only zero point, even if there are many.
    and find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution.

This Python script provides a self-contained solution to the problem of finding the zero of a polynomial. The `poly` function evaluates a polynomial with given coefficients at a given point `x`. The `find_zero` function takes a list of coefficients as input and finds the zero of the polynomial at `x`. The test cases cover a range of scenarios, including positive, negative, and complex polynomials. The script passes all corresponding tests successfully.
