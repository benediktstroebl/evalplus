The code defines two functions: `poly` and `find_zero`. The `poly` function evaluates a polynomial with given coefficients at a given point `x`. The `find_zero` function finds the zero of a polynomial, given a list of coefficients `xs`. The code then tests the functions by passing a sample polynomial and a list of coefficients. The output is the functions'poly and `find_zero` are tested successfully.
