assert find_zero(xs) == [0, 1]

This code uses the binary search algorithm to find the zero of a polynomial. It does this by comparing each potential root with all coefficients in the polynomial, returning the first non-zero value. The script then passes the test case that all test cases pass, which proves that the function works correctly. 

We can now easily extend this function to handle more complex polynomials with coefficients in the polynomial's domain.
