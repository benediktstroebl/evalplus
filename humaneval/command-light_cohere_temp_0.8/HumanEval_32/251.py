This Python script defines two functions, `poly` and `find_zero`, which solve a polynomial equation. The `poly` function calculates the degree and coefficients of a polynomial, and the `find_zero` function finds the zero of the polynomial. The script includes a corresponding tests to ensure the correctness of the functions.
