This code contains a self-contained function that finds the zero of a polynomial. This is a is a recursive approach, which is the same as the previous code you provided. The only difference is done in this way: the polynomial is broken down into smaller components until it is a linear combination of polynomials that have only a degree 1. The function then checks if the coefficients of the polynomial are zero and returns the point x where this condition is satisfied.
