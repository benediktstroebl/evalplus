This script has a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests.  It provides a function `poly` which evaluates polynomial with coefficients at a given point `x`. The function `find_zero` finds the zero of a polynomial `poly(x)`. The function `test_poly` tests a polynomial and returns `True` if the test passes. The function `test_find_zero` tests the `find_zero` function with a polynomial and a point `x`.
