This Python script defines a function `poly` that computes the polynomial expression with given coefficients and `x` as a point to evaluate it. The function `find_zero` is used to find the zero of the polynomial `poly(x)`. It uses the Trie data structure to search for all zeros of the polynomial. The function successfully finds the solution for the given polynomial.
