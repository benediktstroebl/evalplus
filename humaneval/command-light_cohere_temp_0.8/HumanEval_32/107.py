This Python script provides a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests. The `poly` function evaluates a polynomial at a given point `x` by summing the coefficients `xs` raised to the power of `x`. The `find_zero` function finds the zero of a polynomial `poly(x)` by looking for the largest non zero coefficient, which guarantees a solution.  The function then handles the coefficients of the polynomial and returns only the zero point, even if there are many solutions. The tests in the code demonstrate the correctness of the functions.
