The Python script includes a self-contained function that evaluates polynomials and finds their zeros. The function, `poly`, computes the sum of the coefficients multiplied by the corresponding powers of x, using the `math.pow()` function. The function, `find_zero`, finds the zero of the polynomial `poly(x)` by dividing the polynomial by the leading coefficient. The test cases include a coefficients of a polynomial, and the function `find_zero` is called with these coefficients. The script then prints the results of the function for each test case, showing the value of x and the result of the function.
