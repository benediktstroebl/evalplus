This code provides a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the test. The problem is to find the zeros of a polynomial. The solution is a rational root of the polynomial. The function works by evaluating the polynomial at x = 0, and finding the value of the polynomial evaluated at x = 0, which is 0. The function then returns only the root of the polynomial, which is the value of the polynomial at x = 0.
