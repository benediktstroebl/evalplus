This Python code defines a polynomial evaluation and a function to find the zero of a polynomial. The polynomial evaluation function takes a list of coefficients and a point `x` as input, and returns the polynomial evaluation at `x`. The `find_zero` function finds the zero of the polynomial with the given coefficients. It iterates through all coefficients, and at each iteration, it checks if any coefficient is zero and updates `x` accordingly. Finally, it returns the smallest value of `x` that makes all coefficients non-zero. 

The code then provides test cases to demonstrate the functionality of the functions, printing the results.
