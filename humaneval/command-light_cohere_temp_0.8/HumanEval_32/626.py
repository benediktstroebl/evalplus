The code defines a function find_zero that takes a list of coefficients xs as input and returns the x-value where the polynomial evaluates to zero. The function uses the expected output as the target value for the given input. The code also defines a function poly that takes a list of coefficients xs and a variable x as input and returns the polynomial value at x. The unit tests verify that expected output of the poly function for different test inputs.
