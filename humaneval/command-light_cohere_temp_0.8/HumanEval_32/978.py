This code solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests. It includes a following:
- It validates that the input is a list of coefficients of a polynomial of a certain degree, with even length and coefficients greater than zero.
- It calculates the zero of the polynomial using the `math.pow` function.
- The tests that value of the polynomial at `x = 0` against the coefficients.

The code is well-documented and includes comments explaining each section of the code, making it easier to understand.
