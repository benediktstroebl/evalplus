This Python code defines a polynomial function `poly` that computes the polynomial with given coefficients at a given point `x`. It also defines a function `find_zero` to find the zero of a polynomial. The `test` function evaluates a given polynomial at different values of `x` and checks if the polynomial value matches a reference polynomial value. The code also demonstrates the use of these functions with a sample polynomial and passes the test.
