This code provides a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of finding the zero of a polynomial. The `poly` function evaluates a polynomial with coefficients in the list `xs` at a given point `x`. The `find_zero` function finds the zero of this polynomial at `x` by using the Newton's method. The test suite contains three test cases that verify the functionality of the `find_zero` function.  The test_find_zero` function contains the test suite.
