The provided Python script defines a self-contained function that solves the problem of finding the zero point of a polynomial. The polynomial function evaluates a polynomial with given coefficients at a given point x and returns the polynomial result. The find_zero function takes a list of coefficients as input and finds the zero point of the polynomial by determining the value of the polynomial at that point. 

The script also provides a test case for the function, checking if the polynomial equality holds true for a given list of coefficients. The test case passes the test and demonstrates the functionality of the find_zero function.
