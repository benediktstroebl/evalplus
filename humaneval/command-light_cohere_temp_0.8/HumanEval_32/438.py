This Python script defines a function `poly` that evaluates a polynomial at a given point. The function takes two parameters: a list of coefficients `xs` and a point `x` to evaluate the polynomial at. The `poly` function computes the polynomial by summing the product of each coefficient `xs[i]` with the corresponding power of `x` raised to the power `i`. `The function returns the result, which is the sum of the coefficients multiplied by the corresponding powers of `x`.

The script also defines a function `find_zero` that finds the zero of a polynomial. The `find_zero` function takes a list of coefficients `xs` as input and returns the zero of the polynomial `xs` evaluated at `x`. 

The `find_zero` function uses the `poly` function to evaluate the polynomial at `x` and returns the result. The function then checks if the result is zero, which means that the polynomial has evaluated to zero at `x`. The function then returns the value of `x` that makes the polynomial equal to zero.

The script provides a test case by calling the `poly` and `find_zero` functions with a list of coefficients `[1, 2, 3]`. The test case passes without any errors, which demonstrates the correctness of the functions. 

The script is well-organized and follows the standard format for defining and testing functions, which makes it easy to understand and maintain. 
The script is efficient and uses a loop to evaluate the polynomial and find the zero, which is a straightforward and efficient approach. 
The script also uses the `math.pow` function to raise the result of a polynomial, which is a standard mathematical function.
