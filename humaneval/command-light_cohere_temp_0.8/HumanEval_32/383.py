This Python code defines a polynomial evaluation function (`poly`) and a function to find the zero of a polynomial (`find_zero`). The `poly` function calculates the value of a polynomial with given coefficients at a given point `x` by summing the products of coefficients and applying the `pow` function. The `find_zero` function finds the root of the polynomial equal to zero and returns the corresponding value of the coefficient.  The purpose of this function is to solve polynomial equations and find the roots of polynomial functions. 

The code provides an example usage where it calculates the value of the polynomial `f(x)` using the `poly` function and finds the root of the polynomial `f(x)` equal to zero using the `find_zero` function. The output will display the value of `x` that makes the polynomial equal to zero.
