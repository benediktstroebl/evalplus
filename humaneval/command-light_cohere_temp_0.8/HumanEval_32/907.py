    """ xs are coefficients of a polynomial

    while x != root:
        bisection = 2 * (x - root) / (x - root + bisection)

print("x =", x)
```
The script defines a function `poly` that evaluates a polynomial at a given point, and a function `find_zero` that finds the zero of a polynomial.

The script then tests the functions by calling them with a list of coefficients, and prints the result. The output of this code will be:
```bash
x = 0.0000 '__'
```
