The above script defines two functions: `poly` evaluates a polynomial at a given point, and `find_zero` finds zeros of the polynomial. 

The `_find_zero` function is a helper function that converts the list of coefficients to a list of floats and then uses the `math.log` function to find the root of the polynomial using the formula for finding the zero of a polynomial.
