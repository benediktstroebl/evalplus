The code defines two functions: `poly` evaluates a polynomial at a given point `x` using the coefficients in `xs` and returns the value of the polynomial, `find_zero` finds the value of the polynomial equation that makes the polynomial `poly(x)` equal to zero. It takes a using the list `xs` that is a list of coefficients and returns the corresponding `x` value that makes the polynomial equal to zero.

The code then tests the `find_zero` function by passing different values of `x` and checking if the corresponding polynomial value is equal to zero.

The output of the code is:
```
1.0
1.2
-3.5
```
