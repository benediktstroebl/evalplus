```python
import math
def find_zero(xs):
    if len(xs) != 2:
        raise ValueError("Input list must contain exactly two coefficients.")
    x1, x2 = map(float, xs[0:2])
    return x1**2 + x2**2
```
The function returns the solutions of the polynomial equation in the form of a list of perfect squares. The function raises a ValueError if the input is not a list of two coefficients.

This is just one example way to solve this problem, and there are other ways to implement this function.
