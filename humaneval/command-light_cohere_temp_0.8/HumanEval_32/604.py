This script defines a function `poly` that evaluates a polynomial with coefficients `xs` at `x` and returns the polynomial sum. The function `find_zero` finds the zero of the polynomial `poly(x)` by evaluating it at `x` and returns the zero point. The tests pass for both functions, and the code is self-contained.
