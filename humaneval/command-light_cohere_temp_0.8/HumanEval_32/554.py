The code includes two functions:
1. `poly` is a function that evaluates a polynomial at a given point `x` using the given coefficients `xs`. The function sums up the products of `x` raised to powers of each index `i` and the corresponding coefficient `ci` for each `i`. 
2. `find_zero` is a function that finds the zero of a polynomial. It takes the polynomial `p` as input, which represents the coefficients of the polynomial, and returns the value `x` that makes the polynomial equal to zero. 

The `find_zero` function only returns the value `x` that makes the polynomial equal to zero, and it does not return any other values. The `test_find_zero` function tests the `find_zero` function by passing a known polynomial as an argument and asserting that the result is equal to a certain value. 
Finally, the code passes tests to ensure the correctness of the `poly` and `find_zero` functions.
