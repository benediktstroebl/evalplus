    In this code it a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of finding the zero of a polynomial function. The function takes a list of coefficients of the polynomial and returns the zero of the polynomial. The function is tested to be deterministic, meaning it will always produce the same result given the same input. 

The function uses the poly function to evaluate the polynomial and returns the zero of the polynomial by evaluating the polynomial at the input value x. The function also uses the mathematical property that the zero of a polynomial function is a single value, not a set of values. This property is using the mathematical sum to find the zero of a polynomial.

The function was tested with a list of coefficients and a set of test values, and passed all tests with flying colors.
