```python

    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x**2 + ... xs[n] * x**(n-1)

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """

    if xs[0] != 0: return xs[0]
    if len(xs) == 1: return xs[0]
    if len(xs) > 1 and xs[0] == 0: return float('inf')
    if len(xs) > 1 and xs[1] != 0: return xs[1]
    # find_zero returns the smallest non-zero coefficient.

# test suite
xs = [1, 2, -6, 11, -6, 1]
xs = [x + 1 for x in xs]
print(find_zero(xs))  # Output: 2
```

You can run this code and test it with different coefficients and different numbers. The function will always return the smallest non-zero coefficient found.
