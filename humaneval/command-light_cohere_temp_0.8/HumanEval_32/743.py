This Python code defines a polynomial evaluation and polynomial zero-finding function. It uses the simplest polynomial zero-finding algorithm, where it iteratively multiplies the polynomial by a constant factor until the polynomial becomes zero, then returns the value of the constant factor that causes the polynomial to become zero. 

The code then tests the polynomial evaluation and zero-finding function by providing a sample polynomial (1,2) and printing the corresponding value of x. The output will be an value of x that makes the polynomial equal to zero, which is approximately 0.0.19 in this
