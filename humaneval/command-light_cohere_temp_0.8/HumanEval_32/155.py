    find_zero finds x such that poly(x) = 0
    find_zero returns only zero point, even if there are many.
    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients and
    largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution.

```
This code demonstrates a Python function called `find_zero` that finds the root of a polynomial equation with coefficients provided. The function takes a list of coefficients xs and returns the value of the solution (or root) of the polynomial in x.

The code then provides two examples:
1. Example 1: It finds the root of a polynomial with coefficients [1, -2, -3, 4] and prints the result.
2. Example 2: It finds the root of a polynomial with coefficients [-6, 11, -6, 1] and prints the result.

This script is self-contained and does not require any external functions or modules. It can be used to solve polynomial equations and find their roots.
