    >>> round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2) # f(x) = 1 + 2x

    >>> round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2) # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3

The above Python script defines a polynomial evaluation function `poly` and a function `find_zero` that finds the zero of a polynomial. The `poly` function computes the polynomial sum of the coefficients at a given point `x` by using the `math.pow` function. 

The `find_zero` function, given a list of coefficients `xs`, finds the `x` value at which the polynomial equals zero. The function also returns the value `round(x, 2)` for the solution, to ensure a more readable output. The test that passes without errors.
