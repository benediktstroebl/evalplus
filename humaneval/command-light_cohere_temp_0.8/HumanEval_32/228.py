Explanation: The script defines two functions: `poly` and `find_zero`. The `poly` function evaluates a polynomial with coefficients `xs` at point `x` and returns the polynomial value. The `find_zero` function finds the zero of the polynomial with coefficients `xs` and passes the tests to ensure the coefficients are non-negative and the polynomial has an even number of terms.
