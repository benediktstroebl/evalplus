The solution in Python is a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the test. The function uses the `find_zero` to find the zero point of the polynomial and then checks if the list of coefficients is all numbers or not.  The `find_zero` function is a recursive function that takes a list of coefficients and a number `x` as input, and returns the zero point of the polynomial evaluated at `x`.
