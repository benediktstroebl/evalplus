```python
import math

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x**2 + ... + xs[-1] * x**(-n)
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial
    find_zero finds x that makes poly(x) = 0, returns only x, and does not modify xs.

    >>> round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2) # f(x) = 1 + 2x
    -0.5
    >>> round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2) # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
    1.0
   
    algorithm works because it can reduce x^n^4 to a tree-like structure of length n.

This solution is an implementation of the algorithm for finding the zero of a polynomial. 
The function uses the `find_zero` function to create a polynomial of degree n with coefficients in the list `xs` and then iteratively computes the value of the polynomial at the point `x`. The function then repeatedly divides the polynomial by a large value until the value becomes zero, at which point `x` is returned.
