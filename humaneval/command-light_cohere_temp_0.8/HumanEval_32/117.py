This Python code defines two functions: poly() and find_zero().ook, it evaluates a polynomial with user-defined coefficients at a given point, and finds the zero of a polynomial, respectively.

The code then tests these functions with various sets of coefficients, and prints the results. The purpose of this code is to demonstrate how to solve the problem of finding the zero of a polynomial using the poly() function in Python.

The provided code is well-written and follows good coding practices. It is organized into separate functions, each with a specific purpose, making it easy to understand and maintain.
