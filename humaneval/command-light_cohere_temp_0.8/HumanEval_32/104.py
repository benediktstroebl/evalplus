This script defines a function `poly` that evaluates a polynomial with given coefficients at a given point `x`. It also defines a function `find_zero` that finds the zero of a polynomial by iterating through its coefficients and checking if each coefficient is zero at the given `x`. The `find_zero` function only returns the zero point, and it does not provide the list of all solutions. The `find_zero` function also ensures that the list of coefficients has an even number of coefficients and that the largest non zero coefficient is used to guarantee a solution.
