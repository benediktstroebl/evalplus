The code includes a function called `poly` that evaluates a polynomial with coefficients as input at a specific point `x`. The function returns the polynomial evaluation. The function also has a corresponding test to ensure its correctness. The `find_zero` function searches for the value of the polynomial equal to 0 and returns the corresponding `x` value. It has additional tests test to ensure its results are correct and handle various scenarios.
