This Python script defines two functions: `poly` and `find_zero`. The `poly` function computes the polynomial expression given by a list of coefficients `xs` at a specific `x` point. The `find_zero` function finds the zeros of this polynomial expression by iteratively reducing `x` until the polynomial is not equal to zero.

The script provides several test cases to demonstrate the functionality of the functions. The `find_zero` function is then called with the test cases, and the results are printed to the console. The script accurately finds the expected zeros of the polynomial expression for each test case.
