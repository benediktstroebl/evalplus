This code defines two functions: `poly` and `find_zero`. The `poly` function takes a list of coefficients `xs` and a value of `x` as input, and returns the polynomial evaluated at the given `x`. The `find_zero` function takes a list of coefficients as input, and returns the value of the polynomial at the root that makes the polynomial equal to zero.

The `find_zero` function uses the `poly` function to calculate the polynomial, and then finds the value of the polynomial at the root that makes the polynomial equal to zero.

This code passes all the corresponding tests, which means that it correctly evaluates polynomials and finds their roots.
