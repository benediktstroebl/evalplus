The provided Python code defines a function `poly` that evaluates a polynomial at a given point `x` by summing its coefficients. It also defines a function `find_zero` that finds the roots of a polynomial represented as a list of coefficients `xs` by identifying the value `x` for which the polynomial equals zero. The function uses a condition to determine whether to return the zero point. 

The code then can be used to evaluate polynomial functions and find their roots, which are the values of `x` at which the polynomial equals zero.
