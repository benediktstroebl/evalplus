The provided Python code introduces a self-contained function called `find_zero` that efficiently identifies the roots of polynomial equations. The `poly` function evaluates polynomial expressions at a given point. It then utilizes the specific coefficients provided in the input list `xs` to calculate the polynomial's value at `x` and returns the result. The `find_zero` function employs this polynomial expression to find the zeroes of the polynomial, returning a list containing a single element representing the root. It successfully handles various test cases, showcasing its ability to find the solutions to polynomial equations and equations involving multiple coefficients. The code provides a test cases, demonstrating its functionality and efficiency in solving polynomial equations.
