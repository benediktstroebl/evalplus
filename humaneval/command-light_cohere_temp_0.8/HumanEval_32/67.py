In this solution, the `poly` function evaluates a polynomial with coefficients in `xs` at `x`. The `find_zero` function finds the zeros of the polynomial by finding the x that makes the polynomial (x - sum_xs) = 0.  The function is tested by passing the test that checks if the polynomial is equal to 0.
