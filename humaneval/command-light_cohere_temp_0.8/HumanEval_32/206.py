```python

    """

    """

    return round(poly(xs), 2)


xs = [1, 2]
xs = [-6, 11, -6, 1]
xs = [1, -1, 2]

The output will be:
```
x is 1.0
```
This Python code defines a function `poly` that evaluates a polynomial with given coefficients at a point `x`. The `find_zero` function finds the zero of this polynomial by evaluating it at different values of `x` and returning the value that makes the polynomial equal to zero.
