    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs.sum([coeff *i *math.pow(i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """ xs are coefficients of a polynomial
    find_zero find x that makes poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only zero point, even if there are many solutions

```
In this script, the `poly` function calculates the polynomial with the given coefficients at a given point `x`. The `find_zero` function finds the zero of this polynomial. The test passes the expected output to be a float representing the root of the polynomial.
