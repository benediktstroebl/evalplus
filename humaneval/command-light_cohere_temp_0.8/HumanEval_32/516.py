The function `find_zero` returns the value of x that satisfies the polynomial equation `poly(x) = 0`. The function uses the formula `x = -math.sqrt(-1) / math.sqrt(1)` to find the zero, as it guarantees a solution. The formula is based on the property that the square root of a negative number is always positive.  The function then only tests the first n coefficients, as it is sufficient to test a basis set of coefficients to ensure the existence of a solution.
