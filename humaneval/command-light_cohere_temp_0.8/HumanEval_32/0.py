The `poly` function computes the value of a polynomial with the given coefficients at a given point `x`. The `find_zero` function uses the `poly` function to find the root of the polynomial, and returns the value of `x` at which the root is located.  The function also uses the above tests to ensure that the input is a valid polynomial with coefficients and that there is only one root.  The function also checks that the input polynomial has even number of coefficients and that the largest coefficient is not zero.  This can only guarantee a existence of a root, and returns `None` if there are no roots.
