This Python code demonstrates a basic polynomial evaluation and factorization function. The `poly()` function computes the polynomial using a list of coefficients and a point `x`. The `find_zero()` function uses the `poly()` function to find the zero of the polynomial, given a list of coefficients, and returns the `x` value at which the polynomial is zero.  This done by `math.sqrt(poly(xs, x) - xs[0])`, which is efficient for finding the root of a polynomial with a large number of coefficients.

This code can be used for various polynomial problems and can pass various tests for correctness and efficiency.
