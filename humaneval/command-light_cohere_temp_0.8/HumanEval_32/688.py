The provided code defines a function `poly` that evaluates a polynomial with given coefficients at a given point `x`. The function takes two parameters: `xs`, which represents the coefficients of the polynomial, and `x`, which is the evaluation point. The function returns the value of the polynomial evaluation at the given point.

The code also defines a function `find_zero` that finds the zero of a polynomial. The function takes one parameter `xs`, which represents the coefficients of the polynomial. The function returns the value of the first zero of the polynomial, which is the value of the polynomial evaluation at the point `x`.

The code ensures that the `find_zero` function only returns the first zero value of the polynomial, even if there are multiple roots. The function uses the largest non-zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution. The function returns the value of `x` that makes the polynomial equal to zero.

Overall, the code provides a function to evaluate polynomials at a given point and a function to find the zero of a polynomial, using the largest non-zero coefficient to ensure a solution. The code is self-contained and can be used to solve polynomial equations and evaluate polynomials at specific points.
