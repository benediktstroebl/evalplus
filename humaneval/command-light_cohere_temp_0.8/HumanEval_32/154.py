The script defines two functions, `poly` and `find_zero`, which evaluate polynomial and find zeros respectively. The `poly` function returns the sum of the coefficients at a given point, and the `find_zero` function returns the zero of a polynomial using the coefficients of the polynomial and the point to evaluate at. The test cases are passed to the functions to ensure that they are correct.
