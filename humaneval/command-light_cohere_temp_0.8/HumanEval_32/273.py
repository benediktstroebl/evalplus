This Python script defines two functions: `poly` and `find_zero`. The `poly` function evaluates a polynomial with given coefficients at a given point `x`. The `find_zero` function finds the zero of a polynomial given as coefficients, using the `poly` function. The script then demonstrates the use of the functions by evaluating a polynomial at a specific point and finding its zero.

The `find_zero` function takes a list `xs` as input, where `xs` are the coefficients of a polynomial. It returns the zero point of the polynomial, even if there are multiple roots. The function works by evaluating the polynomial at `x` using the `poly` function, and then checking if the result is equal to zero. The function only returns the zero point if the polynomial is equal to zero, otherwise, it returns a non-zero value.

The `poly` function takes a list `xs` and `x` as input, where `xs` are the coefficients of the polynomial and `x` is the point at which to evaluate the polynomial. It returns the polynomial evaluated by summing the products of each coefficient multiplied by the corresponding power of `x`. The function works by using the `pow` function from the `math` module to calculate the power of `x` for each coefficient in the polynomial. 
The `find_zero` function is a valuable tool for finding the zero of a polynomial, which can be used in various mathematical and computational applications.
