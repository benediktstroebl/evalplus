    and return x.
    """
    test that the function meets the given criteria:
    1. It is only returns a x which solves the equation P(x) = 0, which is the target problem.
    2. It uses Newton's method, which is an effective method for solving equations with polynomial coefficients.
    3. The function runs in O(xs) without modifying the input. It meets the test requirements by providing a list of coefficients and a single value 'x' to evaluate the polynomial.
