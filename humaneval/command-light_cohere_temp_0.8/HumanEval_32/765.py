The script provides a self-contained function solve_problem() that takes a list of coefficients xs and tests whether the input is valid or not. The function also includes input validation tests to ensure that the input list has the correct format and contains valid coefficients.

The test cases provided are meant to cover a range of potential inputs and demonstrate that the function correctly handles various scenarios. The function find_zero finds the zero of a polynomial with given coefficients and returns the roots of the polynomial if there are any solutions.
