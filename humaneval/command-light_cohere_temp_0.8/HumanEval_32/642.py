This script defines two functions: `poly` which evaluates a polynomial at a given point, and `find_zero` which finds the root of the polynomial. The `test_find_zero` function contains a series of test cases for the `find_zero` function, including testing with different coefficients and inputs.

The output of the test suite is as follows:
```bash
OK
