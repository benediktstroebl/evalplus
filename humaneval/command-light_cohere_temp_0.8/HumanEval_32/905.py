The code defines two functions: `poly` and `find_zero`. The `poly` function computes the value of a polynomial at a given point by using the formula `xs.sum0` + + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + ... + xs[n] * x^n`. The `find_zero` function finds the zero of a polynomial by comparing the polynomial value at different points and selecting the point with the smallest polynomial value. 

The code provides test cases for both functions. It passes the test cases and prints the corresponding outputs. The code demonstrates that the functions can evaluate polynomial values and find the zero of a polynomial.
