This code defines a polynomial evaluation and a function to find the root of a polynomial. 
The `find_zero` function finds the zero of the polynomial `poly(x)` by evaluating it at x and returning the result. The test is the simplest case of the polynomial being equal to 0, which is passed to the function to ensure that the function works correctly.
