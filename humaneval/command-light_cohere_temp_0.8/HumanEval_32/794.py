This Python code defines a function `poly` that computes the polynomial with given coefficients and a point `x`. It then defines a function `find_zero` that finds the zeros of the polynomial with given coefficients. The `find_zero` function uses the `poly` function to evaluate the polynomial at different points and returns the point that makes the polynomial equal to zero. The test function verifies that the correctness of the `find_zero` function by passing various inputs through it and checking that the function returns the correct values. 
In the script, there are several test cases that cover different scenarios, such as polynomials with different coefficients, points, and even zero coefficients. 
Finally, it prints "All tests passed" to indicate that all the tests have been successfully passed.
