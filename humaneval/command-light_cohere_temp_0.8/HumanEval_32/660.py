    find_zero finds x that makes poly(x) = 0, returns only zero point, even if there are many roots.
    check:     ^3f(x) == x - 4f(x)
    check: -6f(x) == x + 4f(x)
    check: -9f(x) == x + 3f(x)
    return [x for x in [3, 4, -6, -9] if check(x)]

# Example usage
xs = [1, 2]
x = find_zero(xs)
print(x)
```
The function finds the x-value that makes the polynomial equation poly(x) = 0. It returns the value x, which passes the test that the polynomial equals 0 at that x-value.
