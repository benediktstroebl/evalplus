In this code, the poly function evaluates a polynomial with the coefficients provided as the list xs at the point x. The find_zero function finds the zero of this polynomial and returns the corresponding value. The test_find_zero function tests the correctness of the find_zero function by verifying that it returns the correct result for a given polynomial. The test_poly function evaluates the polynomial at the point 0 and compares the result with the expected value.
