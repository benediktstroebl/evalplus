This Python code defines a function called `find_zero` that solves the problem of finding the zero of a polynomial. The polynomial is defined as a list of coefficients `xs`, and the function takes this list as input and returns the zero of the polynomial evaluated at the found point `x` along with the coefficient `xs[0]`.  The function uses the logarithm of the polynomial and the coefficients to find the zero of the polynomial, and then checks the result against the expected result to pass the test.
