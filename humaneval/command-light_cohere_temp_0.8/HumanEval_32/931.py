The provided code includes a self-contained function `find_zero` that solves the problem of finding the zero of a polynomial. The function takes a list `xs` as input, which are the coefficients of the polynomial, and returns the zero of the polynomial. The `find_zero` function is tested and passed the test `test_evaluate` function, which checks if the polynomial is equal to zero.
