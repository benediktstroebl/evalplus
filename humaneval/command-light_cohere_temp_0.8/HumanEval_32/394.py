The provided Python script defines a function `poly(xs: list, x: float)` that evaluates a polynomial with coefficients `xs` at a given point `x` using the `sum` function. The `find_zero` function finds the zero of the polynomial `poly(x)` by evaluating it at a point `x`. The `find_zero` function only returns the zero point and does not return any error for any other input. 
The tests pass successfully as well.
