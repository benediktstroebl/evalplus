The script defines a function `poly` that evaluates a polynomial at a given point `x`. The `find_zero` function finds the zero of a polynomial represented by the list of coefficients `xs`. The function works by first checking if the list of coefficients has an even number of elements. Then, it calculates the largest non-zero coefficient and scales down the other coefficients accordingly to guarantee a solution. The function continues to calculate the root of the resulting polynomial until the result is approximately equal to 0, indicating that the polynomial has indeed reached the zero.
