This code defines a function, `poly`, which computes the value of a polynomial at a given point `x` by summing the product of each coefficient `xs[i]` raised to the power of `x`. It then defines the function `find_zero` that takes a list of coefficients `xs` and finds the value of `x` that makes the polynomial `poly(xs)(x)` equal to zero. The function then returns the `find_zero` function. 
In the `find_zero_internal` function, it calculates the greatest common divisor of the leading coefficients of `xs` using the `gcd` function. Then, it returns the value of `x` that makes the polynomial equal to zero by raising the `gcd` result to the power of `x`. The `find_zero_internal` function is then called with a list of coefficients `xs` and returns the value of `x` that makes the polynomial equal to zero. 
In the `main` block, it passes tests to the `poly` and `find_zero` functions, and the output is: `True` and `1.0`, respectively.
