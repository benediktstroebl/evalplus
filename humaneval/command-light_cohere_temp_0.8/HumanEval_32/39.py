The script defines a polynomial function that evaluates a polynomial with given coefficients at a given point. It also defines a function that finds the zero of a polynomial with given coefficients. The find_zero function uses the largest non-zero coefficient as a heuristic to find the zero, and it returns only the zero point, even if there are multiple roots. The test cases pass, which demonstrates that the functions work correctly.
