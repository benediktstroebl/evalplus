    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """ xs are coefficients of a polynomial
    find_zero finds x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only zero point, even if there are many.
    Furthermore, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution.

The provided code defines two functions, `poly` and `find_zero`, which are designed to evaluate a polynomial and find its zero, respectively. The `poly` function takes a list of coefficients and a point value `x` as input, and returns the polynomial's value at `x` by using the sum of the product of each coefficient multiplied by the corresponding value of `x`. The `find_zero` function takes a list of coefficients as input and finds the value of `x` that makes the polynomial equal to zero. It returns the unique zero point for the polynomial, even if there are multiple solutions.
