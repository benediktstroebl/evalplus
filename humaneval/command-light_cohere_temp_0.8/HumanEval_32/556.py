This Python script defines a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests. It calculates the problem of finding a solution to the equation `f(x) = 0` using the `poly` function, which computes the value of a polynomial at a given point `x` using the given coefficients `xs`. The `find_zero` function is designed to find the zero of this polynomial, it returns the value of `x` which makes the polynomial equal to zero. Finally, the script passes the tests on the `poly` and `find_zero` functions to ensure their correctness.
