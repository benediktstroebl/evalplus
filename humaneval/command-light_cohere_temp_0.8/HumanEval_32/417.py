The solution to the problem is a Python script with a self-contained function that evaluates polynomial with coefficients at a given point x and returns the sum of the products of the coefficients multiplied by the corresponding powers of x. The function also finds the solution to the problem by finding the zero of the polynomial at x, which returns only one value, even if there are many roots.  The function also ensures that the list of coefficients has an even number of elements, and the largest non-zero coefficient is used to guarantee a solution.

The solution to the problem is a function that takes a list of coefficients and a point x as input and returns the sum of the coefficients multiplied by the corresponding powers of x. This function is also test that the list of coefficients has an even number of elements, and the largest non-zero coefficient is used to guarantee a solution.

The solution is tested by passing the coefficients of a polynomial and the point x as input to the function and checking that the returned value is equal to 0. The function is also tested by passing the coefficients of a polynomial and the point x as input to the function and checking that the returned value is equal to the polynomial evaluated at x.
