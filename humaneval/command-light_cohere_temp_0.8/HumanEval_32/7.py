This Python script defines two functions: evaluate_poly and find_zero. The evaluate_poly function takes a list of coefficients (xs) and a point x as input, and returns the value of the polynomial (xs)(x) at that point. The find_zero function takes a list of coefficients (xs) as input and returns the zero point of the polynomial (xs)(x). It uses the zero- largest non-zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution, even if there are multiple solutions. The find_zero function also returns None if the list of coefficients has an odd number of coefficients.

Note that the find_zero function finds the zero point of the polynomial with the given coefficients, and it does not consider the coefficients' magnitude or order. This means the fastest and most efficient solution for finding the zero of a polynomial.

This script is a self-contained Python solution for the problem of finding the zero of a polynomial using the find_zero function.
