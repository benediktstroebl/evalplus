The function test() verifies if the polynomial's evaluation at x equals the polynomial's evaluation at x + 1. If the polynomial has a same value at both points, then it passes the test. The script also defines the function find_zero() that takes a list of coefficients as input and returns the zero point of the polynomial, which can be used to find the roots of the polynomial. The script then passes the test(xs, x) which passes the test, and outputs True.
