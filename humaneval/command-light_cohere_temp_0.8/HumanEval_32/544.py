    find_zero find x such that polynomial(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only zero point, even if there are many.
    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients and largest non-zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution.

This script defines two functions:
1. `poly` calculates the  the polynomial of a given list of coefficients `xs` at the point `x`.
2. `find_zero` finds the `x` that makes the polynomial `poly(x)` equal to zero.

The `find_zero` function returns the `x`-value at which the polynomial equals zero.

In the example provided, we create a list of coefficients `xs` and then call the `find_zero` function to find the `x`-values where the polynomial equals zero. The output will be a list of `x`-values where the polynomial equals zero.

Note: The code uses the `math` module to access mathematical functions. The code also uses the Python-style guide for formatting and indentation, and follows the PEP 8 guidelines for code style and readability. 

It can be used as a template for solving other problems.
