    xs are coefficients of a polynomial
    find_zero finds x that makes poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only zero point, even if there are many solutions.
    The, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients and largest non-zero coefficient as it guarantees
    a solution.

    The returned solution is a tuple containing x and (xs_inv / xs)[0].

This script solves the problem of finding the zeroes of a polynomial by evaluating the polynomial at a list of points and finding the roots of the polynomial by solving a related system of equations. The function poly() evaluates the polynomial at a given point x, while the function find_zero() finds the zero of the polynomial by evaluating the polynomial at a list of points.

The script demonstrates the functionality by passing a test case with a specific list of coefficients and a corresponding point. The output is the evaluated polynomial evaluated at the test case point and the result is printed.
