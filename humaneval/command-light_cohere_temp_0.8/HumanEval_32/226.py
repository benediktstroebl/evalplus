# Example usage:
xs = [1, 2]

The provided Python code defines a function called `poly` that evaluates a polynomial with given coefficients at a given point `x`. The `find_zero` function finds the zero of a polynomial with given coefficients using binary search. The code then demonstrates the example usage by creating a polynomial with coefficients [1, 2], and then finding the value of `x` that makes the polynomial equal to zero. The output will show the solution and the resulting polynomial expression.
