This Python script defines a function `poly` that evaluates a polynomial at a given point `x`. The `find_zero` function finds the zero of a polynomial by selecting the root of the polynomial with the largest non-zero coefficient as the x-value. The script includes test cases to demonstrate the correctness of the functions.
