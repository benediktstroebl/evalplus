The provided Python code defines a set of functions that work with polynomial functions. 

The `poly` function takes a list of coefficients `xs` and a point `x` as input, and evaluates the polynomial at the given `x` by summing the products of the coefficients and using `math.pow()` function. The result polynomial evaluated by evaluating the coefficients at `x` and returning their sum. 

The `find_zero` function finds the zero of a polynomial `poly(x)` by evaluating it at `x = 0`. 

The `find_zero` function returns the zero value of `poly(x)` at `x = 0`, regardless of the number of solutions. 

The `test` function is used to test whether a polynomial with coefficients `xs` evaluates to a specific `expected_zero` at `x`. 

The code demonstrates the usage of the `poly` and `find_zero` functions by evaluating polynomials and passing tests.
