The provided code defines three functions: poly(), find_zero(), and test_find_zero().

The poly() function calculates the result of a polynomial using the formula "sum([coeff * pow(x, i)])" for a list of coefficients and a point x. The find_zero() function finds the zero of a polynomial by comparing the polynomial's value at various points with the zero of the polynomial. The test_find_zero() function tests the functionality of the find_zero() function by providing a list of coefficients and an integer n, and asserting that the function returns the correct result.

The code provides a self-contained test suite for polynomial evaluation and zero-finding, ensuring that the functions behave correctly and meet the specified conditions.
