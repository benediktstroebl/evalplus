```python
import math

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x**2 + ... + xs[-1] * x**(-1)

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial
    find_zero finds x such that poly(x) = 0, that is, it returns only one root, even if there are many.
