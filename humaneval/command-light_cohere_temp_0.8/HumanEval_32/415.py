The provided Python code defines two functions, `poly` and `find_zero`, which efficiently evaluate polynomial expressions and find their roots. 

The `poly` function takes a list of coefficients and a point `x` as input and returns the polynomial evaluation at the given `x`. It utilizes the `math.pow()` function to efficiently calculate the polynomial evaluation. 

The `find_zero` function finds the zero point of a polynomial, given its coefficients as input. It uses the mathematical properties to determine the zero point and returns the corresponding `x` value. 

The code then applies these functions to evaluate polynomial values, pass tests, and find the polynomial root. 

The output will display the polynomial values and the `x` values at which they are evaluated.
