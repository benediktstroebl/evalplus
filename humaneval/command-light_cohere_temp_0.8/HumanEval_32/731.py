The script uses a function `poly` to evaluate a polynomial at a given point and a function `find_zero` to find the zero of the polynomial. The `find_zero` function sorts the coefficients of the polynomial, removes all non-zero coefficients, finds the largest coefficient, and calculates the value of the coefficient at x = 0. The `find_zero` function returns the value of the coefficient.
