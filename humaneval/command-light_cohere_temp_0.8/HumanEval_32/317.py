The Python script defines a function `poly` that evaluates a polynomial at a given point `x` based on a list of coefficients. The function then computes the coefficients of the polynomial and returns its value at the given point. The function `find_zero` finds the zero of a polynomial and takes a list of coefficients as input. The function then returns the root of the polynomial. The function is then designed to find the zero of a polynomial efficiently, and it can handle a variety of polynomial coefficients.

The `find_zero` function works by considering the list of coefficients and finding the largest non-zero coefficient. It then uses this largest non-zero coefficient to guarantee a solution and finds the corresponding value of `x` that satisfies the polynomial equation. The function returns the root of the polynomial.

The script then tests the `poly` and `find_zero` functions by evaluating them with the same list of coefficients. It passes the test the test that the polynomial function returns the correct value and the `find_zero` function returns the correct root. The script then prints the root of the polynomial.
