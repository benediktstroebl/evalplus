This script defines a polynomial function that evaluates a polynomial with given coefficients at a given point x. It also defines a function that finds the zero of this polynomial, it does so by finding the only zero of the polynomial's derivative at x, which is guaranteed to be unique for a polynomial of even degree. The function then passes these tests that demonstrate the correctness of the functions.
