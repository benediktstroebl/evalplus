This Python script defines a function `poly` that computes the polynomial expression with a list of coefficients at a given point `x`. The `find_zero` function identifies the zero of the polynomial with a list of coefficients and returns the index of the zero or the smallest nonzero coefficient. The `test_find_zero` function tests the `find_zero` function with a list of coefficients, expecting it to return a valid zero index. The test passed successfully, indicating that the `find_zero` function works as expected with the test coefficients.
