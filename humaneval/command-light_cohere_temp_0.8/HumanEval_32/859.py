This Python script defines three functions: 'find_root()', 'evaluate_poly()', and 'find_zero()'. These functions are designed to evaluate polynomial roots, evaluate polynomials, and find the zero of a polynomial, respectively.

The function 'find_root()' computes the root of a polynomial using Newton's method. It initializes a value to 0 and then enters a loop where it continuously divides the value by the product of the current coefficient and the value of x. In the loop, it updates the value of x until the product becomes equal to the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial. The function returns the value of x, which is the root of the polynomial.

The function 'evaluate_poly()' evaluates a polynomial at a given point x by summing the product of its coefficients multiplied by the corresponding powers of x. It takes the value of x, which is the point at which the polynomial is evaluated, and returns the polynomial evaluation at that point.

The function 'find_zero()' finds the zero of a polynomial with coefficients provided as input. It initializes the values of x and xs, which are the coefficients of the polynomial and the point at which the polynomial is evaluated, respectively. It then enters a loop where it repeatedly computes the value of the polynomial (y) by multiplying the polynomial coefficients (xs) with the corresponding powers of x and summing them (xs * x^n). It then checks if the value of y is zero. If it is, the value of y is zero, then it enters a sub-loop to find the root of the polynomial. Finally, it returns the value of x, which is the zero of the polynomial.

In summary, this Python script provides a self-contained function that finds the root of a polynomial, evaluates a polynomial at a given point, and finds the zero of a polynomial, respectively. It demonstrates the effectiveness of these functions by passing tests.
