The provided code demonstrates the evaluation of polynomial equations and the finding of their zeros. The `poly` function takes a list of coefficients (`xs`) and a point value `x`, computes the polynomial expression, and returns the result. The `find_zero` function identifies the zero of the polynomial using the same approach, ensuring that only the root with the largest non-zero coefficient is returned. The tests pass the test the polynomial against known values, confirming the correctness of the functions.
