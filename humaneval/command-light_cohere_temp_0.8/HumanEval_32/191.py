The Python code provided defines a function `poly` that evaluates a polynomial with given coefficients at a specified point `x`. The `find_zero` function is used to find the zeros of the polynomial. Both functions are written to be self-contained and can be used together to solve the problem of evaluating polynomials and finding their zeros.
