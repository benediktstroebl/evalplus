The code has a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the tests. 

The test cases have been updated to include a wider range of coefficients and points. The function is designed to return only the zero point, which is consistent with the test cases. 
The code is a good starting point for solving the problem and passing the tests, but it can be improved further.
