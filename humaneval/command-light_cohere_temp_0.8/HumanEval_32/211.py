This code provides a self-contained Python function that finds the zero of a polynomial. It does this by passing the polynomial in the `poly` function, which evaluates the polynomial at the given `x` and returns the result. Then, the `find_zero` function takes the polynomial and `x` value as input and checks if the polynomial is equal to zero at `x`. The output will be the `x` value that makes the polynomial equal to zero.
