The function `find_zero` implements the algorithm described in the prompt. It has tests with a list `xs` of coefficients and returns `True` if the largest non zero coefficient in `xs` is zero and returns `False` otherwise.  The function can guarantee that the `xs` list has an even number of coefficients and that the largest non zero coefficient guarantees a solution.
