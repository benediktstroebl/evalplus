The script defines a function `poly` that evaluates a polynomial at a given point `x` using the given coefficients. The function `find_zero` finds the zero of a polynomial with coefficients passed as an argument. The `test_find_zero` function contains a few assertions that check the correctness of the `find_zero` function.  The script can be run to evaluate the functions and pass the test.
