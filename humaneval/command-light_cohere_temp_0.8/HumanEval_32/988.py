The function `poly` takes a list `xs` of coefficients and a point `x` as input and evaluates the polynomial at the point `x`. The function `find_zero` takes a list `xs` of coefficients and finds the zero of the polynomial `poly(x) = 0`. The test functions pass the corresponding coefficients lists and evaluate them at the respective points.

This code demonstrates how to evaluate polynomial functions and find their zeros in a markdown code block using Python.
