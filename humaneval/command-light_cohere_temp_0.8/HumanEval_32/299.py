The solution to the problem is a Python script that defines two functions: poly and find_zero. The poly function evaluates a polynomial with a list of coefficients at a given point x. The find_zero function finds the zero of the polynomial at x. The script then passes the tests that check if the poly and find_zero functions are correct.
