In this script, the `poly` function evaluates the polynomial given the coefficients `xs` at `x` by summing the products of `x` and the corresponding coefficients. The `find_zero` function finds the zero of the polynomial by taking the derivative of the polynomial n(x) = x**n and equating it to zero.

This script provides a self-contained function that can evaluate the polynomial and find its zero.
