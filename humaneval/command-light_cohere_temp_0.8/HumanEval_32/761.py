# test cases
test_cases = [
    [(-3, 4), (-1, 2)],
    [4, -6],
    (0, 1),
    (2, 0),
    (1, -1),
    (10, -10)]

for case in test_cases:

    assert x == case[0]
    assert poly(case) == y
``` 
This solution uses the divide-by-factor technique to find the root of the polynomial. It's an recursive approach that works for all polynomials. The test cases ensure the x and the polynomial match the expected output values.
