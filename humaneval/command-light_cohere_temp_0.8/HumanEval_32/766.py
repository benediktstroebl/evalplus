```
The function `find_or_calculate_zero` uses the polynomial formula to find the x value where the polynomial equals zero. The function then returns the value of x that makes the polynomial equal to zero.

This code is a self-contained Python script that has a function to find the x value where a given polynomial equation equals zero.
