In this script, we have defined a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the test. The function `poly` evaluates the polynomial with coefficients xs at point x, and the function `find_zero` finds the x that makes the polynomial equal to 0. The function `ensure_even_coefficients` ensures that the list of coefficients has even number and the largest non zero coefficient is even. 

The test_solve function asserts that the function `find_zero` returns the correct value for a given input.  The code passes the test and prints "OK" if it succeeds, or "NOT OK" otherwise.
