This script defines a function `poly` that evaluates a polynomial at a given point `x` and returns the polynomial's value at that point. It also defines a function `find_zero` that finds the zero of a polynomial with given coefficients `xs` by finding the value of the polynomial at a point `x`. 

This code passes the test by evaluating the polynomial at the point and checking if the polynomial's value is equal to zero. The code also passes the value of the function at the point by evaluating the polynomial at the point and checking if the polynomial's value is equal to zero.

This is an example of a self-contained Python script that solves a problem and passes corresponding tests.
