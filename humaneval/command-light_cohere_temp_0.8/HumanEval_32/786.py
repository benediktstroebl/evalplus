This code defines two functions:
1. find same as in your above response, with added docstrings and a function test_find_zero to check the correctness of the find_zero function.
2. The test_find_zero function tests the validity of a quadratic equation by solving the corresponding quadratic equation and comparing the result with the expected value.

In the test_find_zero function, the code tests a quadratic equation by passing the coefficients of the quadratic polynomial to the find_zero function and comparing the result with the expected value.

The test passes successfully, demonstrating that the find_zero function correctly finds the zero of a quadratic equation.
