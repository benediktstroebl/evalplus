This Python script contains a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the tests. The test cases are provided to test the function. The function `find_zero` finds the zero of a polynomial by iteratively increasing the `x` value until the polynomial becomes zero. The test cases ensure that the function works correctly with different sets of coefficients.
