    find_zero finds x such that poly(x) = 0, i.

    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution.

xs = [1, 2]

The code is a Python script that finds the zero of a polynomial. The function `poly` evaluates a polynomial at a given point x and returns the polynomial's value at that point. The function `find_zero` finds the zero of a polynomial by finding the root of the polynomial's derivative. The function also performs some tests to ensure that the input is a list of coefficients of a polynomial and that the input has a positive leading coefficient.
