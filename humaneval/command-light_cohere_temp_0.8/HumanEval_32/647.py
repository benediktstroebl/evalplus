This code defines a function called `poly` that evaluates a polynomial with given coefficients at a given point. The function takes a coefficients of the polynomial as input and returns the polynomial evaluated at the given point. The function also defines a function called `find_zero` that finds the zero of a polynomial. 

The `find_zero` function returns only the zero point of the polynomial, even if there are many solutions. The function only takes a list of coefficients having an even number of elements and the largest non-zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution. 
The `find_zero` function is then tested and checked to see if it returns the correct results for some examples. 

Finally, the code defines some values for the coefficients and calls the `find_zero` function with those values. The function returns the result, which is the zero of the polynomial with those coefficients.
