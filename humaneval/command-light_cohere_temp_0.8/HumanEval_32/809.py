This Python code demonstrates polynomial interpolation and finding roots. 

The '**`poly`**' function computes the value of a polynomial with given coefficients at a given point. The '**`find_zero`**' function searches for a root of a polynomial equation, ensuring that it returns the smallest absolute value of the solution for a positive x value. 

Two lists, '**`xs`**' and '**`ys`**', are provided to the '**`find_zero`**' function. The '**`poly`**' function value is then printed for the specified '**`xs`**' and the result of '**`find_zero`**' is displayed.
