The code defines two functions: `poly` and `find_zero`. The `poly` function computes the polynomial value of a given list of coefficients `xs` at a given point `x` and returns the result as the sum of the products of the coefficients multiplied by the corresponding powers of `x`. The `find_zero` function searches for the zero point of the polynomial using the `poly` function and returns the result as the value of `x` that satisfies the equation. The function also handles the specific requirements: the list `xs` must have an even number of coefficients and the largest non-zero coefficient.
