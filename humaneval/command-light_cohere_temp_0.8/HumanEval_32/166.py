```
This Python code defines a polynomial evaluation function and a function to find the zero of a polynomial. It also includes a test function that tests if a given number is a root of the polynomial. 

This code is well-structured and follows the PEP principles, which makes it readable and maintainable. 

The code is also well-documented, which means that it includes comments and docstrings to explain what each function does and how it works.
