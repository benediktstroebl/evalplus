The code defines two functions: `poly` and `find_zero`. The `poly` function computes the value of a polynomial at a given `x` point by summing the product of each coefficient multiplied by the corresponding power. The `find_zero` function is used to find the `x` value that makes the polynomial equal to 0. 

The code then tests these functions by providing two sets of coefficients `xs` and checking that the output of `find_zero` function matches the expected result.
