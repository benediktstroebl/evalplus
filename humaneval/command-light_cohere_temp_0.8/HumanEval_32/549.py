The provided code demonstrates the evaluation of polynomial equations using the provided `poly` and `find_zero` functions. The `poly` function computes the polynomial coefficients at a given point `x`, and the `find_zero` function searches for the zero of the polynomial. 

The test cases section allows users to input values for `x` and displays the result for both functions. The code is self-contained and can be executed without requiring external functions or modules.
