This Python script defines a function `poly` that evaluates a polynomial with coefficients provided as a list at a given point `x` and returns the polynomial's value. The `find_zero` function finds the zero of this polynomial and returns the corresponding `x` value. 

The test section verifies that the `poly` and `find_zero` functions behave as expected by passing various test cases.
