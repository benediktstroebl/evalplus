If the input is a list of numbers, function returns list of zeros of corresponding numbers.

If the input is a dictionary with numbers as keys and coefficients as values, function returns list of zeros of corresponding numbers.

If the input is a list of tuples containing numbers and coefficients, function returns list of zeros of corresponding numbers.

If the input is a list of elements of a polynomial, function raises an error.

If the input is not a list, function raises an error.
```
Here is a sample output:
```
(1.4422)
```

This code has a poly function that evaluates a polynomial at a given point, and a find_zero function that finds the zero of a polynomial. The poly function takes a list of coefficients and a point as input, and returns the sum of the coefficients multiplied by the corresponding powers of the point. The find_zero function takes a list of coefficients as input and returns the zero of the polynomial, which is the only number that satisfies the equation.

The code passes all the tests.
