This script defines a function `find_zero` that finds the zero of a polynomial using the `poly` function. The `test_find_zero` function tests the `find_zero` function with various input combinations.  The function raises a ValueError if the input is invalid, such as not having an even number of coefficients or if the coefficients are not sorted by magnitude.  The output is the largest non-zero coefficient in the input list.
