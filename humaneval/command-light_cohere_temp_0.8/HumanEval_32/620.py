We've defined a function named `poly` in this Python code that computes the value of a polynomial with given coefficients at a specified point. The function accepts two parameters: a list `xs` of coefficients and a `float` value `x`. The function returns the polynomial's value at `x` based on the provided coefficients.

Additionally, we've defined a function called `find_zero` that aims to find the root of the polynomial. The function takes a list of coefficients as input and aims to return the value of `x` that makes the polynomial equal to zero.

The `find_zero` function employs backtracking to traverse through the polynomial's coefficients and calculate the value of `x` that makes the polynomial equal to zero. The function returns a list of zeros and the largest non-zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution to the problem.

You can use this Python script to solve the problem of finding polynomial zeros and pass corresponding tests.
