This code defines a function poly that computes a polynomial's value for a given list of coefficients and a point x. It then defines a function find_zero, which finds the zero of a polynomial by determining the root of the polynomial's numerator divided by its denominator. The function uses the largest non-zero coefficient to ensure a solution.

The code passes all the tests for correctness.
