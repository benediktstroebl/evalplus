You can use this code to solve the problem and pass the test.

This is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of finding zeros of a polynomial and passes the corresponding tests. The script is designed to be a self-contained unit, meaning that it can be used as a standalone function without relying on any external functions or variables.
