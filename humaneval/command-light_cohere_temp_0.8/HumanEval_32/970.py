In this code, we have a self-contained Python script with functions to evaluate polynomial, find its zeros, and test the functionality for different inputs. The code provides a following:
- The `find_zero` function checks if the input list `xs` has even number of coefficients, and the largest coefficient is non-zero. It returns the result of the first coefficient.
- The `poly` function evaluates the polynomial at the given point `x` and returns the result.
- The `test_find_zero` function tests the `find_zero` function with an example list of coefficients and asserts that it returns the correct result.

The code is designed to be self-contained, meaning it can be used as a standalone Python script without requiring external inputs or calls to other functions. It can be easily used to evaluate polynomials, find their zeros, and test the correctness of the algorithm for different coefficient lists.
