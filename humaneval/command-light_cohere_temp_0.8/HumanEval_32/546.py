The output of this script is:
```bash
x: -0.6988
```

Note that this script is a self-contained implementation and does not require external functions or modules.  It provides a mathematical evaluation of polynomial functions and the finding of zeros of these functions, making it useful for many mathematical and engineering tasks.
