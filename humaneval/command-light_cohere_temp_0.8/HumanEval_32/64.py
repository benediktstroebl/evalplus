The script defines two functions: `find_zero` and `poly`. The `find_zero` function validates the input and returns the zero of the polynomial if the input is valid, otherwise it returns 0. The `poly` function calculates the sum of the product of the coefficients and the corresponding powers of x, for a polynomial with given coefficients and x as parameter. The test cases demonstrate the validity of the functions by passing the test cases and asserting the result. 

This Python script defines a self-contained function that solves the problem of finding the zero of a polynomial and passes corresponding tests.
