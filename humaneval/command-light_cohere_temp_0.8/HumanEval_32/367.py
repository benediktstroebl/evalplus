This script has a function `poly` that takes a list of coefficients and a point `x` as input, and returns the polynomial `f(x)` evaluated at the given point. The function `find_zero` takes a list of coefficients as input and returns the zero point of the polynomial. The tests that passed using the above code are valid.
