The provided Python script defines a function `poly` to evaluate a polynomial with given coefficients at a given point `x`. It also defines a function `find_zero` that finds the zeros of the polynomial. The `find_zero` function ensures that the list of coefficients has an even number of elements and the largest non-zero coefficient to guarantee a solution.
