In this script, we define a function `evaluate_poly` that evaluates a polynomial at a given point `x`. The function uses the `find_zero` function to find the polynomial zeros. 
The `find_zero` function iterates over the coefficients of the polynomial and checks if the polynomial is equal to 0 at the given point `x`. 

This script passes the test for a valid polynomial function.
