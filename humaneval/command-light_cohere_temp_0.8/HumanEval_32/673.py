The provided code defines two functions: `poly` and `find_zero`. The `poly` function computes the polynomial value of a given list of coefficients at a specific point `x`. It uses the `math.pow()` function to evaluate the polynomial coefficients and returns the sum of the resulting product. The `find_zero` function searches for the zero point of a polynomial represented by a list of coefficients `xs`. It calls the `poly` function with the coefficients and the point `x` and returns the zero point `x` that makes the polynomial equal to zero. The code implements polynomial and polynomial zero-point calculations and passes tests for correctness.
