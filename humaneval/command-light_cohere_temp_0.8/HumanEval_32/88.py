The script defines two functions: `poly` and `find_zero`. The `poly` function evaluates a polynomial at a given point, given a list of coefficients. The `find_zero` function finds the zero of a polynomial, given a list of coefficients. 

The main part of the script evaluates the `find_zero` function for the given test cases. It then prints the result of `find_zero` for each test case, which is the zero point of the polynomial. The test cases ensure that the function works correctly for different polynomial coefficients.
