The test_solution_is_valid function is used to test the validity of the solution. The function passes the test by evaluating the polynomial at the solution x and checking if it equals 0. If it equals 0, the function returns True, indicating a valid solution. The function also checks if the solution x is not equal to 0 or 1, as those are not valid solutions for the polynomial.
