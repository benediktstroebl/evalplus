This Python code defines a function `poly` that computes the polynomial expression for a given list of coefficients `xs` at a given point `x` using the sum of products of the coefficients multiplied with the corresponding powers of `x`. The function also defines a function `find_zero` that finds the zero of a polynomial expression `poly(x)` by iteratively substituting `x` with each coefficient `xs` in the polynomial expression until a value is reached that makes the polynomial zero. The code also includes three tests to verify the correctness of the functions, which pass the tests with the expected values.
