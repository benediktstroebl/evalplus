The provided code defines two functions: `poly` and `find_zero`. The `poly` function takes a list `xs` of coefficients and a point `x` as input and evaluates the polynomial at `x`. The `find_zero` function takes a list `xs` of coefficients and finds the zero of the polynomial at `x`. The `find_zero` function returns the value of the largest non-zero coefficient in `xs` as the value of the solution, and also rounds the result to a specified number of decimal places.
