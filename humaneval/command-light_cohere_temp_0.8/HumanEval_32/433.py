The script's function `find_zero` searches for the x-value at which the polynomial function `poly` equals zero. It employs a approach by incrementing x and checks if the polynomial is zero. The function returns the value of the first non-zero x-value and the corresponding coefficient of the polynomial.

The function passes the test of being a polynomial function since it returns a zero at a single point. The function also passes the test of being a single-valued function since it returns a single tuple (x, coeff).

Note that `find_zero` only returns the x-coordinate where the polynomial equals zero. This means that it is not an exhaustive function for finding all zeros of a polynomial. The function may also return other types of results if used with polynomials that are not zeros.
