```python
import math

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x**2 + ... xs[n] * x**n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """ xs are coefficients of a polynomial
    find_zero finds x that makes the polynomial equal to 0.

    ensure you domains are only list of numbers as coefficients
    ensure all numbers are positive.

    largest non zero coefficient is
    find_zero returns only zero points.
    further, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees
    a solution.

    >>> round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2) # f(x) = 1 + 2x
    -0.5
    >>> round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2) # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
    -1.0

So, the function works and passes the test.
