This code defines two functions: `poly` and `find_zero`. The `poly` function evaluates a polynomial with a given list of coefficients at a given point `x`. It uses the sum function to calculate the sum of the coefficients multiplied by the corresponding powers of `x`. The `find_zero` function finds the zero of the polynomial `poly(x)` by evaluating it at `x`. The function returns the zero of `poly(x)` as its result. 
The script then defines a list of coefficients `xs` and an `x` value. It passes these list and `x` and `x` to the `poly` function to evaluate the polynomial. Then, it passes the result to the `round` function to round it to two decimal places and then prints the result.
