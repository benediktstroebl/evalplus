The function `find_zero` in this code will locate the x-value at which the polynomial equation poly(x) equals zero. The function accepts a list `xs` as input, which represents the polynomial's coefficients, and returns the x-value at which the polynomial equation is satisfied. 
This function is self-contained and may be used to solve polynomial equations without the need for outside inputs or function calls.
