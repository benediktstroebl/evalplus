The script defines two functions, `poly` and `find_zero`, which solve the polynomial equation and find the zeros, respectively. The `poly` function evaluates the polynomial with a given list of coefficients at a given point, while the `find_zero` function finds the zeros of the polynomial with a given list of coefficients.
