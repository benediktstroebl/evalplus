The provided code contains two main functions: `poly()` and `find_zero()`. The `poly()` function computes the polynomial given a list of coefficients and a point value. The `find_zero()` function searches for the zero of the polynomial given a list of coefficients. 

The script then uses these functions to solve the problem and pass the corresponding tests. The output will be a corresponding values of `x` and `y` for the given inputs.
