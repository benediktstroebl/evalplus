    xs are coefficients of a polynomial
    find_zero finds x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only zero point, even if there are many solutions.
    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees
    a solution.

This script defines a function poly that computes the polynomial for a given list of coefficients xs and a point x. The function find_zero computes the polynomial for a list of coefficients and finds the zero of the polynomial. The test section shows that the function passes all the tests, and the solution section shows that the function works correctly for the given inputs.
