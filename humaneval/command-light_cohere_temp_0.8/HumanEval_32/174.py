This Python script defines a function `poly` that evaluates a polynomial with given coefficients at a given point `x`. The function `find_zero` finds the zero of the polynomial `poly(x)` by determining the value of `x` that makes the polynomial equal to zero.

The test cases demonstrate the functionality of the functions, and the `assert` statement checks if the output of `find_zero` is correct for the given input.  The script provides a self-contained solution to the problem of finding the zero of a polynomial equation.
