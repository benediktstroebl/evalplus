This code defines two functions, `poly` and `find_zero`, that evaluate polynomial equations at a given point and find the zero of the polynomial, respectively. It uses the following test to evaluate the polynomial at a given point:

```python
def test(x, poly):
    return poly(x) == 0
```

The function `test` takes two arguments: `x` which is the point at which the polynomial is evaluated, and `poly` which is the polynomial that is evaluated at `x`.

The function `test` returns `True` if the polynomial is equal to zero at `x`, and `False` otherwise.
