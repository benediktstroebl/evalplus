```python
import math
def find_zero(xs):
    if len(xs) % 2 != 0:
        raise ValueError("List must have even number of coefficients")
    return math.pow(xs[-1])
``` 
This Python code defines a function called `find_zero` that takes a list called `xs` as an argument. The function checks if the list has an even number of coefficients, raising a `ValueError` with an appropriate error message if not. It then uses the`math.pow(xs[-1])` to find the zero of the polynomial, which is the last coefficient multiplied by the corresponding power. The function returns the value of the resulting power. 

This code provides a straightforward and efficient solution to the problem of finding the zero of a polynomial.
