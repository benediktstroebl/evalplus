This function calculates the factorial for a given number n. It uses a recursive approach, where the base case is when n is 0, returning 1. If n is greater than 0, the function returns n multiplied by the factorial of n-1, which is the correct definition of the factorial function. The test cases are included to ensure the function is working correctly for all valid inputs.
