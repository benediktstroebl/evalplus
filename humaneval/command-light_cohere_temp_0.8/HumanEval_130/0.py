This code defines a function `tri` that calculates and returns a list of the first `n+1` numbers in the Tribonacci sequence. It uses a value of `n` for the argument, and checks if `n` is a positive integer, and raises a `ValueError` exception if it's not. It then uses a recursive calls to the `subsequence` helper function to calculate the first `n` numbers in the Tribonacci sequence. 

Please note that this code does not require any external inputs or references to function calls or variables, and the calculated result is returned as a single list.
