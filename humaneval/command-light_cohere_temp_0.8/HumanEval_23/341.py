Certainly! Here is a self-contained Python function that calculates the length of any given string:
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns length of the given string"""
    return len(string)
```

You can use this function to get the length of any given string, for example:
```python
string = "Hello, World!"
print(strlen(string))
```

The output will be:
```bash
13
```
