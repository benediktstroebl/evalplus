```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    return len(string)

# Test case 1
assertEqual(strlen(''), 0)
# Test case 2
assertEqual(strlen('abc'), 3)
```
This code defines a function `strlen` which takes a string as an argument and returns its length. The code then passes the test cases to ensure the correctness of the function. 

Would you like me to assist you in solving any other coding problems?
