Here's a self-contained Python function that calculates the length of a given string:
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string """
    return len(string)
```
The function takes a string as input and returns an integer - the length of the given string. This is a simple and efficient solution uses the built-in `len()` function.
