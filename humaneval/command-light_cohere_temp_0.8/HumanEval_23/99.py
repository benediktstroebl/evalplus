Here's the code:
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string """
    return len(string)
```

This code defines a Python function `strlen` which takes a string `string` as an argument and returns the length of that string. It achieves this by using the Python's built-in `len()` function.
