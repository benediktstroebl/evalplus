Here's the self-contained Python function to calculate the length of a given string:
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    return len(string)
```
This function takes a string as an argument and returns its length using the built-in function `len()`. The provided tests are also correct and pass the function. You can use this course and explore more ways to write self-contained functions.
