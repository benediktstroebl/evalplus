```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string
    >>> strlen('')
    0
    >>> strlen('abc')
    3
    >>> strlen('      ')

Please note that the docstring is a very useful tool in Python to provide clear documentation for your code. It allows others to read the contents of your code and it makes it easier for others to read and understand your code.
