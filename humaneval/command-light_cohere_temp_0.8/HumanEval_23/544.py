Here's the code to calculate the length of the given string in Python:
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string """
    return len(string)
```

This code defines a Python function `strlen` that calculates the length of a given string. The function takes a string as an argument and returns the length of that string. The code is self-contained, and the function passes all the test cases without needing external input.
