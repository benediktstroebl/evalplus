Here's the self-contained Python script that solves the problem of calculating the length of a given string:
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    return len(string)

# Test cases for strlen function
test_strlen = [
    ''.__ unpack("'")
    assert strlen('') == 0, "Should return 0 for an empty string"
    assert strlen("abc") == 3, "Should return 3 for 'abc'"
    assert strlen("") == 0, "Should return 0 for an empty string"
    assert strlen("123") == 5, "Should return 5 for '123'"
    assert strlen("abc123") == 6, "Should return 6 for 'abc123'"
    assert strlen("") == 0, "Should return 0 for an empty string"
]

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.load("test_strlen.py")
   
     run()
```
The code defines a function `strlen` that calculates the length of a given string. It returns an length of the string. The test cases are designed to cover various scenarios, such as empty strings, common words, and longer strings. The test cases assert the results with the expected lengths, and the `main` block ensures that the code is run when the script is executed.
