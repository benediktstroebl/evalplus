Here is a self-contained Python function that calculates and returns the length of a given string:
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    return len(string)
```

The code defines a function called `strlen` that takes a string as input and returns an integer representing the length of that string. It achieves this by using the Python's built-in `len()` function, which returns the length of the given string.
