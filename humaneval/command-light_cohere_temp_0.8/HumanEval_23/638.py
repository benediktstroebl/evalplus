Here is a self-contained Python function that calculates the length of any given string:
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string """
    return len(string)
```

This `strlen` function utilizes the built-in `len()` function that returns the length of the passed string. This is function serves as a ultimate tool for determining the length of any string, and its use and functionality are entirely self-contained within the Python script.
