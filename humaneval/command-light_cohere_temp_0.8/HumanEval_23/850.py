```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    return len(string)

# Test case 1:
assert strlen('') == 0

# Test case 2:
assert strlen('abc') == 3
```
This script defines a function `strlen` that calculates the length of a given string. The function uses the simple Python's `len()` function to get the length. It passes the test cases with valid inputs and asserts that the output of the `strlen` function matches the expected length. 

Please note that this solution is self-contained within the script and does not require any external imports or functions.
