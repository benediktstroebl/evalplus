```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    return len(string)

# Test case 1
assert strlen('') == 0

# Test case 2
assert strlen('abc') == 3
```
This code defines a function `strlen` that calculates the length of a given string. It passes two test cases provided in the test suite using `assert`.  The output is as expected, the function returns 0 for an empty string and returns 3 for the string "abc".  This effectively demonstrates that the code is correct and self-contained.
