Here is a self-contained Python function that calculates and returns the length of a given string:
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string """
    return len(string)
```
This code defines a function called `strlen` which takes a string as input and returns the length of that string using the built-in `len()` function. 
The docstring comments provide a clear explanation of the purpose and usage of the function.
