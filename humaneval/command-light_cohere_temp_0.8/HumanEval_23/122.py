Certainly! Here's a self-contained Python script that defines a function `strlen` that calculates the length of a given string:

```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string """
    return len(string)

# Testing the function
>>> strlen('')  # Output: 0
>>> strlen('abc')  # Output: 3
```

This code is self-contained. It defines a string length calculation function and passes the tests. You can use this above function to calculate the length of any given string.
