Here's the self-contained Python function that calculates the length of a given string:
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """Return length of given string
    """
    return len(string)
```
This code defines a function `strlen` that takes a string `string` as input and returns the length of the given string using the built-in function `len(string)`. 

Note that this code is self-contained and does not require any external modules or functions.
