Here's the self-contained Python function that calculates the length of a given string:
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns the length of the given string"""
    return len(string)
```

This code provides a simple and self-contained solution to calculate the length of a given string using the built-in function `len()` in Python, which returns the length of the given string as an integer. 
Feel free to use this code for your problem and modify it further if needed!
