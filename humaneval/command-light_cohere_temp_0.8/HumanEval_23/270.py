Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function `strlen` which calculates the length of a given string:
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    return len(string)

# Test case 1
assertEqual(strlen(''), 0)
# Test case 2
assertEqual(strlen('abc'), 3)
# Test case 3
assertEqual(strlen('abcabc'), 6)
```
This code defines a function `strlen` that calculates the length of a given string. It passes three test cases with different strings and different expected lengths. This code is a simple and clear way to solve the problem in Python.
