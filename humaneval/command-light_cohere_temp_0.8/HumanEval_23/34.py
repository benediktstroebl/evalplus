Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function strlen that calculates and returns the length of a given string:
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string
    >>> strlen('')
    0
    >>> strlen('abc')
    3
    >>> strlen('Spaces are for )')
    5
    >>> '' == str.empty()
    string

    """

Would you like to see more such self-contained functions with tests?
