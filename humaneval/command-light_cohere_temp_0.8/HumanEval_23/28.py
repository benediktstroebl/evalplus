Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of calculating the length of a given string:
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string
    >>> strlen('')
    0
    >>> strlen('abc')
    3
    >>> strlen('')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<string>", line 3, in strlen()
        ^
    AttributeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment  [ veggie.py]```
 can be used to calculate the length of any string passed as an argument.
