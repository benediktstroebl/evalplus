Here's a solution:

```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string """
    return len(string)
```

This function uses the built-in `len()` function to get the length of the given string, which is a concise and commonly used way to find the length of a given sequence of characters in Python.

It also includes helpful docstrings to provide clear documentation for the function, which is good programming practices.
