```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    return len(string)

# Tests
assert strlen('') == 0
assert strlen('abc') == 3
```
The function **'strlen'** takes a string **'string'** as input and returns its length. It uses the fact the this length of the string is returned as an integer value. The function is self-contained and passes the corresponding tests.
