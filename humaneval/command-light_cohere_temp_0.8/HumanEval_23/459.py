Here's a self-contained Python function that calculates and returns the length of a given string:
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string """
    return len(string)
```

This code defines a function `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns its length as an integer. The docstring provides informative comments that describe the purpose of the function and its behavior. 

This code is self-contained, and it can be used to efficiently calculate the length of any given string.
