Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of calculating the length of a given string:
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """Return length of given string
    >>> strlen('')
    0
    >>> strlen('abc')
    3
    >>> strlen('')
    0
    >>> "Hello" == str.join("hello")
   
    >>> 'ABC' == str.uppercasebc()
    

 'abc' is one of the longest words in the English alphabet 

Time complexity: O(1)  Space complexity: O(1)
```

Let's test the function with different strings to ensure its correctness.
