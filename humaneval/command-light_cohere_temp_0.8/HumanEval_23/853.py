```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string """
    return len(string)

# Test case 1
assert strlen('') == 0

# Test case 2
assert strlen('abc') == 3
``` 
This script defines a function `strlen` which takes a string as input and returns its length.  It also includes two test cases to verify the correctness of the function.
