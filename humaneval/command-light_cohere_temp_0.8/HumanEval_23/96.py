Certainly, here's a self-contained Python function that calculates and returns the length of a given string:
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns length of the given string"""
    return len(string)
```

This function takes a string `string` as an argument and uses the Python `len()` function to return the length of the string. This is pure Python solution and can be used in any environment.
