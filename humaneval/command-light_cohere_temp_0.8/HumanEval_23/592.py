Here's the provided self-contained Python function that calculates and returns the length of a given string:
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string """
    return len(string)

# Testing the function
>>> strlen('') # Should return 0
>>> strlen('abc')  # Should return 3
```
This code defines a function `strlen`, which takes a string as an argument and returns its length. 

It utilizes the Python's built-in `len()` function to obtain the length of the provided string. The function is designed to be self-contained, passing all tests successfully.
