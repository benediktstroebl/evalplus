Here's the solution:
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string """
    return len(string)
```

The above code defines a Python function `strlen` that calculates the length of a given string. It uses the general string's `len()` function to get the length.

This self-contained solution can be used to calculate the length of any string in Markdown code blocks or anywhere else.
