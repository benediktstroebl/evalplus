Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of calculating the length of a given string:
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string """
    return len(string)
```

This script defines a function called `strlen` which takes a string as input and returns the length of that string using the `len()` function. 

You can use this to solve the problem in markdown code blocks, or anywhere else in your Python code.
