Here's a self-contained Python function that calculates and returns the length of a given string:
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string """
    return len(string)
```

This function takes a string as input and returns an integer -- the length of the provided string. You can use the reason on the string to test the function, and you can see that the result is returned instantly.

Please note that the function doesn't take any arguments, and the return value is the length of the string, which is computed using the `len()` function.
