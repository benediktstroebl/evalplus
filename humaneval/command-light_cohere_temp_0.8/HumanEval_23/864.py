Here's the solution:
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    return len(string)
```

This code defines a function `strlen` that calculates the length of a given string. It uses the str.len() function to directly return the length of the input string, which is a built-in function that returns the length of a string in Python. The code is self-contained, which means it doesn't rely on any other functions or modules to complete its task.
