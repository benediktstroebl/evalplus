```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns length of given string """
    return len(string)

# Test the function:
print(strlen(''))  # Output: 0
print(strlen('abc'))  # Output: 3
``` 
This code defines a function `strlen` that calculates the length of a given string. It uses the `len` method to get the length of the string, which is then returned. The test cases pass successfully, with the function returning the correct results.
