```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    return len(string)

# Test case 1
assert strlen('') == 0

# Test case 2
assert strlen('abc') == 3
```

This code defines a function `strlen` that calculates and returns the length of a given string. It passes two test cases with correct assertions, demonstrating its functionality.
