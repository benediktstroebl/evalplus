```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    return len(string)

# Test case 1
assert strlen('') == 0

# Test case 2
assert strlen('abc') == 3
```

This code defines a function `strlen` that calculates and returns the length of the given string. The code is written in a self-contained manner, with no external dependencies. It passes the test case 1, which checks if an empty string has a length of 0, and test case 2, which checks if the length of 'abc' is 3. The code is well-structured, adheres to Python best practices, and is easy to read and understand.
