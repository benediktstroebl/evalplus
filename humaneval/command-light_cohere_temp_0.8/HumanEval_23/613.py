Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of calculating the length of a given string:
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns length of the given string
    """
    return len(string)
```

This script provides a function `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of that string using the `len()` function.  The can be used to pass the tests you provided.
