Certainly! Here's a self-contained Python function that calculates and returns the length of a given string:

```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Returns length of the given string """
    return len(string)
```

You can use this function just like you would with any built-in function:

```python
# Test case
print(strlen(''))  # Output: 0
print(strlen('abc'))  # Output: 3
```

I hope this provides a complete solution for the given problem statement.
