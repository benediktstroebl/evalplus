Here's a self-contained Python function that calculates the length of any given string:
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string """
    return len(string)
```

This function accepts a string `string` as an argument and returns its length using the built-in `len()` function. The docstring is properly describes its intended functionality.
