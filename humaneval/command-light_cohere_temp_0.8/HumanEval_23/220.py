```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    return len(string)

# Test case 1
assert strlen('') == 0
# Test case 2
assert strlen('abc') == 3
```
This code defines a function `strlen` that calculates and returns the length of the given string. It uses the `len` built-in method to get the length of the string passed as a parameter. The function is tested and passes the corresponding tests successfully.
