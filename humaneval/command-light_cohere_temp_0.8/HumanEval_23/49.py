Here is a self-contained Python function that calculates the length of a given string:
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string
    """
    return len(string)
```
This function takes a string as input and returns an integer, representing its length.

In this version of the function, the return type is explicitly defined as an integer using the `int` class, which is a common convention for function returns. This ensures that the string length is returned consistently as an integer, and can be used in other integer-based operations and comparisons.

The function is also properly indented and formatted, which helps to improve readability and maintain consistency in code structure. 

This version of the function is self-contained, meaning it does not rely on any external functions or modules, and can be fully understood and tested within the script.

These improvements help with better code quality, clarity, and maintainability.
