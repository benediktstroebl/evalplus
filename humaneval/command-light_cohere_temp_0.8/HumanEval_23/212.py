Here's the solution to the problem:

```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string """
    return len(string)
```

This code defines a `strlen` function that takes a string as input and returns its length. It uses the fact that the Python function is named `len`, which returns the length of the given string.

You can call the function with any string, and it will return the length of that string.

Let's breakdown the code:

1. First, we define the function `strlen` with a single parameter `string: str` which is a string.
2. The `string` parameter in the function is a string that needs to be found.
3. The `return` keyword is used to specify that the function will return an integer.
4. The expression `len len(string)` returns the length of the string.
5. This length is `len` is an integer value that represents the length of the string.

Finally, the code passes the test and you can use the `strlen` function to calculate the length of any string.

This is a self-contained solution to the problem and it does not require any external libraries or imports.
