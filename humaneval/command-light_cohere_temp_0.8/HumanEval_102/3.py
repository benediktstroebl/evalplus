```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    """This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the
    biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive. If 
    there are no number, then the function returns -1.
    """
    code"""
    numbers
    if x < y:
        return -1
    else:
        return x ##

# Testing the function
x = 25
y = 10
result = choose_num(x, y)
print(result)  # Output: 25
``` 
The above function works by checking if x is less than y, and if so, returns -1. If x is greater than y, it returns x.
