```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.14159 * (a**h)

def test_triangle_area():
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5, "Assertion failed: Wrong area calculation"
    assert triangle_area(6, 4) == 12.2856, "Assertion failed: Wrong area calculation"
``` 
This Python code defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle given the lengths of its sides (`a` and `h`). The function uses the mathematical formula for the area of a triangle, `Area = (1/4) * (a**2 + b**2)`, where `a` and `h` are the lengths of the sides, and `b` is the perpendicular distance between the sides. The code also includes a `test_triangle_area` function, which tests the `triangle_area` function by asserting that its result is correct for the given inputs.
