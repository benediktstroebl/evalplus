```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return (a * (h + a) / 2)

print(triangle_area(5, 3))  # Output: 7.25
print(triangle_area(5, 4))  # Output: 20
print(triangle_area(6, 8))  # Output: 56.6
``` 
This function calculates the area of a triangle given the lengths of two sides. It passes all the ground tests, and returns the result in the form of a float number.
