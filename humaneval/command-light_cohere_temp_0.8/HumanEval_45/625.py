```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 5.0 * (sqrt(3.0 * a / 2.0 * aa *a * h)

def test_triangle_area():
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5, "Test failed"
    assert triangle_area(8, 4) == 40.0, "Test failed"

```
This Python script defines a function `triangle_area` that computes the area of the triangle given its base and height. It then defines a test function `test_triangle_area` that checks the correctness of the `triangle_area` function with the provided test cases.
