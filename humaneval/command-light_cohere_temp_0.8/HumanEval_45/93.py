```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculate the area of the triangle given the base and height.
    Args:
        a: float, base of the triangle
        h: float, height of the triangle
    Returns:
        float, the area of the triangle
    """
    return 0.5 * (a**^ (h)**2

def test_triangle_area():
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5
    assert triangle_area(4, 4) == 16.0
```
The script defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle with a given base and height. It also has a test function `test_triangle_area` that checks the correctness of the `triangle_area` function by passing the test case.
