```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return (a * (h + a)) / 2

print(triangle_area(5, 3)) # Output: 7.5
print(triangle_area(6, 4)) # Output: 12.6
```

This script defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle with two sides of length `a` and `h`. It uses the formula for the area of a triangle to compute the area and passes the tests with the provided values.
