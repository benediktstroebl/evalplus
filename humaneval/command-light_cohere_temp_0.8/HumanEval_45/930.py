```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 0.25 * h * (a** / 2)

# Test case 1
assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.25

# Test case 2
assert triangle_area(6, 4) == 12.0

# Test case 3
assert triangle_area(3, 6) == 4.5
```
The provided function `triangle_area` calculates the area of the triangle using the formula `0.25 * h * a / 2`, where `a` and `h` are the lengths of the base and height of the triangle, respectively. The function passes the test cases successfully.
