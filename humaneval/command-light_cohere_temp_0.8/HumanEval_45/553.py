Here's the solution:

def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculate the area of a triangle given the base and height.
    >>> assert a_eq(triangle_area(5, 3), 7.5)
   
    assert_eq(triangle_area(8, 4), 12.0)
   
    def __str__(self):
        return "Triangle Area Function"

This script defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle based on its base and height. The `__str__()` method is also defined to return the function's name.  It can be used to print the function's docstring.
