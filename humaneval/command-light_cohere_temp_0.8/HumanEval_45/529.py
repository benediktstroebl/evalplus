```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.14 * a * * a * h

def test_triangle_area():
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5, "Test failed"
```

The script defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle with the given base and height. The `test_triangle_area` function tests the `triangle_area` function by passing in the parameters 5 and 3, and expects the function to return the correct result, which is 7.5 square units.
