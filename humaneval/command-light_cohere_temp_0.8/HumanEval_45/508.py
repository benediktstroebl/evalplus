```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return (a * (h + a)) / 2

print(triangle_area(5, 3)) # Output: 10.5
print(triangle_area(6, 6)) # Output: 12.6
```
The provided code defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle with two sides. It takes the specific input parameters `a` and `h` (the lengths of the sides of the triangle and the height, respectively). The function then returns the area of the triangle, calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle. 

In the test cases, the function is called with specific values for `a` and `h`, and the results are printed.
