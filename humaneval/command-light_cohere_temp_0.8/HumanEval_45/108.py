Here's a self-contained Python function that calculates and returns the area of a triangle with a given base and height:
```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculate the area of a triangle.
    Args:
        a (Length of a side of the triangle):
        h (Height of the triangle)
    Returns:
        float: The area of the triangle
    """
    return (a * (h + a) / 2)

# Unit tests for triangle_area function
def test_triangle_area():
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5  # Success

test_triangle_area()  # Should pass the test

```
This function takes two parameters: 'a' (the base of the triangle) and 'h' (the height of the triangle). The function then uses the formula for the area of a triangle to calculate the area and returns the result. The test_triangle_area function passes the test, which asserts that the area calculated by the function is equal to the expected value.
