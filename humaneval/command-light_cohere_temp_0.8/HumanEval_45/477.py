```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.14159 * (a**h)

def test_triangle_area():
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5  # abc

``` 
This code defines a Python function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of the triangle using the formula. It also includes a function `test_triangle_area` that contains a test for the `triangle_area` function.
