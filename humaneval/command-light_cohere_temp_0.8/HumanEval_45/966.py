Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of finding the area of a triangle:
```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculates the area of the triangle using the formula: 
    A = (1/2) * a * h.
    """return (1/2) * a * h
"""
    return "OK"

# Example usage
print(triangle_area(5, 3))  # Output: 7.5
print(triangle_area(6, 4))  # Output: 12.0
print(triangle_area(7, 8))  # Output: 49.0
```

This script provides a function called `triangle_area` that takes two parameters: `a` and `h`, which represent the lengths of the triangle's sides. The function then uses the formula to calculate the area of the triangle and returns the result.
