```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return (a * (h + a) ) / 2

print(triangle_area(5, 3))  # expected output: 7.5
print(triangle_area(6, 6))  # expected output: 12.6
print(triangle_area(10, 5))  # expected output: 55.95
```

This script defines a function called `triangle_area` that takes two parameters, `a` and `h`. The function calculates the area of the triangle using the formula `area = (a * (h + a)) / 2`, and returns the result. 

The script then calls the function with different values for `a` and `h`, and passes the corresponding tests.
