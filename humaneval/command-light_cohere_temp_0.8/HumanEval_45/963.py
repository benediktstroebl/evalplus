```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculates the area of the triangle.
    Args:
    a, h (float):
        Length of the base and height of the triangle, respectively.
    Returns: float:

```

This code defines a function called `triangle_area` that takes two arguments `a` and `h`. The function calculates the area of the triangle using the formula `0.25 * (a * (b + h) / 2)`, where `a` and `h` are the lengths of the base and height of the triangle, respectively. The function then returns the area of the triangle. It raises a error with a ValueError if the inputs are not numbers.
