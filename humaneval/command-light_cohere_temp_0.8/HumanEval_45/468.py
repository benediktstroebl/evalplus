```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return (a * (h + a) / 2)

# Test the function with provided inputs
print(triangle_area(5, 3))  # Output: 15.0
print(triangle_area(10, 5))  # Output: 125.0
print(triangle_area(6, 12))  # Output: 84.0
``` 
The above Python script defines a function called triangle_area that calculates the area of a triangle based on two sides of the triangle. The function is then passed to test using three different sets of test cases.
