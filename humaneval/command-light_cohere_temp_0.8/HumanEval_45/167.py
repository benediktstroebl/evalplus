This code defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle using Heron's formula. The function takes two arguments: `a` (the length of one side of the triangle) and `h` (the height of the triangle).

The `test_triangle_area` function is a standalone Python script that contains a main test function that tests the `triangle_area` function with different input values.
