Here is a Python script that calculates the area of the triangle when you provide the lengths of the two sides:

```python
import math
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return math.sqrt(a**2 + h**2 -math.sqrt(3))
```

You can use this script to calculate the area of any triangle, just provide the lengths of the two sides.
