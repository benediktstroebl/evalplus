Here's a Python script that includes a self-contained function with a docstring and passes the test:
```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Calculate the area of the triangle.
    Args:
        a (float),  side length of the triangle
        h (float),  height of the triangle
    Returns:
        float, the area of the triangle
    """
    return (a*h)/2
```
This script defines a function called `triangle_area` that takes two arguments: `a` (side length) and `h` (height). It then calculates the area of the triangle using the formula `(a * h) / 2` and returns the result.

The function is designed to be self-contained and passes the test. It is well-documented using a docstring that explains the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.
