```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculates the area of the triangle.
    Args:
        a (length of a side of the triangle)
        h (height of the triangle)
    Returns:
        float: The area of the triangle
    """
    return 0.5 * (a * (h) ** 0.25

def test_triangle_area():
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5, "Should return 7.5 for 5, 3"
```

This script defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of the triangle given the lengths of two sides. It also defines a test_triangle_area function, which asserts that the result of `triangle_area` with arguments 5 and 3 is correct.
