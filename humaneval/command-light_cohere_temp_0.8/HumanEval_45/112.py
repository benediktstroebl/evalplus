```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Calculate the area of the triangle."""
    return 0.5 * (a** * (h)) ** 0.25

def test_triangle_area():
    """Test the function."""
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5
    assert triangle_area(10, 10) == 225.0
    assert triangle_area(4, 5) == 20.0
```
This code defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle with given sides and a hypotenuse, and a function `test_triangle_area` that tests the `triangle_area` function with some given inputs.  The test_triangle_area() also passes the test cases.
