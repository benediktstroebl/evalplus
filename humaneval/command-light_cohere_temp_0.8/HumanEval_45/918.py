```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return (a * (h + a)) / 2

# Basic tests
assert triangle_area(5, 3), "Triangle with side length 5 and hypotenuse 3 should give area 15.assert area(6, 4), assert_equal(6.5, 12. area(5, 8), assert_equal(9.0, 24))

# Edge cases
assert triangle_area(0, 0), "Triangle area with 0 length sides should return 0"
assert triangle_area(1, 0), "Triangle area with 1 length side should return 0"
assert triangle_area(1, 1), "Triangle area with 1 length side and 1 length hypotenuse should return 1"
assert triangle_area(-1, -1), "Triangle area with opposite sides should return 0"
assert triangle_area(1, -1), "Triangle area with 1 length side and negated hypotenuse should return 0"
```
This code defines a function called `triangle_area` that calculates the area of the triangle. It takes two parameters of test cases to ensure the function works correctly.
