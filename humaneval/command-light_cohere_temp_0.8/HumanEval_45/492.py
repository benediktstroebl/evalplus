```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculates the area of the triangle given the lengths of two sides.
    Args:
        a (The length of the first side of the triangle.)
    b (The length of the second side of the triangle)
    h (The height of the triangle)
    Returns:
        The area of the triangle in square units.
    """
    # Calculate the area using the formula: a * h
    return a * h
```
The function `triangle_area` takes two arguments: `a` and `h`. The function calculates the area of the triangle using the formula `area = a * h`. The function then returns the calculated area. 

This script defines the area of a triangle and passes the test.
