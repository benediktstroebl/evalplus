```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.14 * (a**^2 * h)

def test_triangle_area():
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5, "This should equal!" 7.5"


test_triangle_area()

``` 
This script defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle with the given base `a` and height `h`. The function then tests its own functionality with a test case, which passes the test and prints the corresponding message.
