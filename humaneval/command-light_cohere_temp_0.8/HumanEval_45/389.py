```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Calculate the area of the triangle given the lengths of two sides."""
    return 0.5 * (a**^(h)) ** .5
```

This Python code defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle given the lengths of its two sides (`a` and `h`). The function uses the formula for the area of the triangle, which involves the Pythagorean theorem (`a**2 + b**2 = h**2`) and multiplies it by the square of the hypotenuse to get the area.
