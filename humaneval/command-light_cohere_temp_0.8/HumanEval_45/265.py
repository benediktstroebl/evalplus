```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculates the area of the triangle given its sides.
    Args:
    a: float, length of the first side
    h: float, length of the third side
    
    Returns:
    float, the area of the triangle
    """
    return 0.5 * (a + h) ** 2
```

This function takes two arguments, a and h, representing the lengths of the first and third sides of the triangle, respectively. The function then returns the area of the triangle, which is given by the formula 0.5 * (a + h) ** 2.
