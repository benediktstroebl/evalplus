```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.14159 * (a **h)

def test_triangle_area():
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5, "This is incorrect!" area!"

test_triangle_area()
``` 
The code defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of the triangle using the formula A = 1/2 * (a * h) * (h + a)^(3/2), where `a` and `h` are the lengths of the triangle's sides.  The performs the area of a triangle in terms of the lengths of its sides.
