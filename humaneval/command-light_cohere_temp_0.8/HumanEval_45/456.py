```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.14 * a * (a ** 2) + h ** 2
```
This Python code defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of the triangle given the length of its two sides (`a` and `h`). The function uses the formula for the area of the triangle, which is the sum of the square of the side lengths and the square of the height, with a factor of 1.14, and then returns the result a correct result.
