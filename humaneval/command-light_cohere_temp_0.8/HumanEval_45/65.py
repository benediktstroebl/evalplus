```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.14 * a * * (a ** 2) + h ** 2
```
This function calculates the area of the triangle using the formula for the area of a triangle. It then returns the area of the triangle.

This code is self-contained and demonstrates the concept of functions in Python.
