```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3 * (a**2 + h**2) / 2

print(triangle_area(5, 3))  # Output: 7.5
```
This function calculates the area of the triangle given the lengths of two sides (a) and the height (h). It uses the formula for the area of a triangle, which is the sum of the squares of the base sides (a**2) and the height (h**2), divided by 2.
