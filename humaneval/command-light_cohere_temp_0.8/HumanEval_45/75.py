```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.14 * a *a * (a ** 2) + h
```
This Python code defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of the triangle given the length of one side (`a`) and the height of the triangle (`h`). The code uses the formula for the area of a triangle and multiplies it by the square of the other side length (`a^2`) and the height. The function then returns the area of the triangle.
