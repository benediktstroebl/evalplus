```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """ Calculate the area of the triangle given the lengths of its sides """
    return (sqrt(a * (h + h)) / 2)

# Test case: Calculate area of triangle with side length 5 and height 3
print(triangle_area(5, 3)) # Output: 7.5
```
This script defines a function called `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle based on the length of its sides. The test case demonstrates the area of a triangle with side length 5 and height 3, and the output is 7.5.
