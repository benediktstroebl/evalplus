```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return sqrt(a*h+h*h+a*h) # Pythagorean theorem formula for triangle area.

print(triangle_area(5,3)) # Output: 7.5
``` 
This function calculates the area of the triangle using the Pythagorean theorem formula. It takes the area of a triangle in a given set of side lengths.
