Here is a Python script that includes a self-contained function to calculate the area of a triangle:

```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Calculate the area of a triangle.
    # Using a area of a triangle is half the product of its base and height
    return (a * h) / 2
```

This script includes a self-contained function called `triangle_area` that takes two parameters: the base `a` of the triangle and the height `h` of the triangle. The function then returns the area of the triangle, which is half the product of its base and height, divided by two.
