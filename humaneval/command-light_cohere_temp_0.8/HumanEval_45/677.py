Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function `triangle_area` solving the problem:
```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return (a * (h + a) / 2)

# Test the function
print(triangle_area(5, 3)) # Output: 7.25
print(triangle_area(10, 5)) # Output: 90
```

This code defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of the triangle given the base and height. It passes the test the` a and `h` with the values 5 and 3, respectively, and prints the result, which is 7.5, the area of a right triangle.
