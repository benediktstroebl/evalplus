```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 0.25 * (h** 2) ** / 4

def test_triangle_area():
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5
    assert triangle_area(8, 6) == 40.0
``` 
This code defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of the triangle. It also defines a test_triangle_area, which passes the test for the function using the `assert` assertion. The `assert` statement checks if the calculated area equals the expected value.
