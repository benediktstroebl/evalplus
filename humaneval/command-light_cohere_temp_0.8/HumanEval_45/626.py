This code defines a Python function called `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle using Heron's formula. The function takes two arguments: `side` and `height`, representing the lengths of the triangle's sides and its height, respectively. The function then uses the formula `sqrt((s*s(a, h, a)) / 2)` to compute the area of the triangle.

The formula uses the complete square integral `s(a, h, k)` of the triangle's semi-perimeter, which is defined as the product of the triangle's sides minus the sum of their areas.  The formula is a generalization of the area of a triangle to any triangle with sides `a, b, c,` whose lengths are `a, b, c`, and whose base angles are `0, a, h, k`. 

This function is then tested with a set of inputs and the corresponding expected outputs.
