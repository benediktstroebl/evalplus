```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 0.25 * (a + h) 

def test_triangle_area():
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.25
    assert triangle_area(10, 5) == 62.75

    assert triangle_area(0.0, 0) == 0.0
``` 
This script defines a function called `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height. The function then passes all of the corresponding tests.
