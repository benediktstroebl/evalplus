    Args:

This Python code defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle based on the lengths of its sides (`a` and `b`) and the base (`h`). The function uses the formula for the area of a triangle, which involves multiplying the square of the length of one side (`a`) by the sum of the squares of the other two sides `(b^2 + h^2) divided by 2, and then multiplying by the hypotenuse `(h + b) / 2)`.

The function takes three arguments: `a` and `b`, which represent the lengths of the triangle's sides, and `h`, which is the base of the triangle.

The function then calculates the area using the formula provided and returns the result as a floating-point number.

The purpose of this code is to provide a generic function to calculate the area of a triangle based on the side lengths and the base, which can be useful in various applications involving geometry calculations.
