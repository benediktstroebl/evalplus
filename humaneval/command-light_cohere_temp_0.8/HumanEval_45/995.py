```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.14 * a * * a * h
```

def test():
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.14 * 5 * 3 and 5,
    assert triangle_area(8, 4) == 20.14 * 4 * 3 and 8
```

This code defines a `triangle_area` function that calculates the area of the triangle based on the given side lengths. The `test` function tests the function by calling it with different inputs and asserting that the returned values are correct.
