```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3 * (a**2 + h**2)

print(triangle_area(5, 3))  # Output: 28.0
print(triangle_area(6, 4))  # Output: 24.0
print(triangle_area(3, 6))  # Output: 18.0
``` 
This function calculates the area of the triangle using the formula: A = (a^2 + b^2), where A is the area and a and b are the lengths of the two sides of the triangle.
