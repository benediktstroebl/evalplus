```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 0.25 * a.NTAHIS correct or On a way of finding the area of a triangle. In general, the base of the triangle is 'a' and the height is 'h'. The area is equal to the product of the base and the height.

### Test cases:
print(triangle_area(5, 3))        # Expected Output: 7.5
print(triangle_area(3, 5))        # Expected Output: 14.0
print(triangle_area(5, 5))        # Expected Output: 25.0
print(triangle_area(2, 6))        # Expected Output: 8.0
print(triangle_area(6, 2))        # Expected Output: 12.0

``` 
This code defines a function called `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle with a given base `a` and height `h`. The test cases ensure that the function returns the correct result for different input values.
