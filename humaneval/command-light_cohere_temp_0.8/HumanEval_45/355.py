Here's the solution to the markdown code block problem using a self-contained Python function:
```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.14 * a * * (a ** 2) / 2 

def test_triangle_area():
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5, " incorrect result"
    assert triangle_area(6, 4) == 12.25, " failed again"
    assert triangle_area(8, 5) == 56.6, " did not work"
```
This code defines a `triangle_area` function that calculates the area of the triangle based on the given sides and passes the test function `test_triangle_area` to verify if the function works correctly.
