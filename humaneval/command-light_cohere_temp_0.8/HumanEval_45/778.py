```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculates the area of the triangle using the formula: 
    A = (1/2) * a * h.
    Returns the area of the area of a triangle.
    Args: 
    a (length of a side)

```
This Python function, `triangle_area`, calculates the area of a triangle using the formula A = (1/2) * a * h, where a is the length of one of the triangle's sides and h is the height of the side.

The function then returns the calculated area of the triangle, A. This function is a syntax and structure is following PEP 8 conventions for Python functions, which improve readability and maintainability.
