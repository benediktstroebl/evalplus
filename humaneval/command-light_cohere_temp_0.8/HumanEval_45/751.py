```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.14 * a * * (a ** 2) + h
```

The above Python script defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates and returns the area of a triangle. In particular, it uses the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the area of a triangle with the provided length of its side and the height.
