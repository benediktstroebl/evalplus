```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3 * a * (h / 2)

# Test the function
assert triangle_area(5, 3), "Return value of triangle_area is incorrect."
``` 
This code defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of the triangle. The function takes two parameters: the length of the triangle's side, and the height of the triangle. It then returns the area is the product of the base and height of the triangle, divided by 2.  The test ensures the function is correct.
