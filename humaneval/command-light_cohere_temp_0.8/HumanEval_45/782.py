```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 5.0 * (sqrt(3.0) / 4.0)
```
def test_triangle_area():
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5
    assert triangle_area(8, 12) == 116
    assert triangle_area(15, 20) == 628
    assert triangle_area(3, 4) == 12
``` 
Is there anything else I can help you with?
