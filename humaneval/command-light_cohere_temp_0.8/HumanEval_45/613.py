```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.14 * (a**^2 * h)

def test_triangle_area():
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5, "This should equal!"
    assert triangle_area(8, 4) == 40.0, "This should equal"
```

The above code defines a `triangle_area` function that calculates the area of the triangle with given side length `a` and height `h`. It then has a `test_triangle_area` function that contains two test cases for the `triangle_area` function, which passes the test and gives the corresponding messages.
