```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return (a * (h + a) / 2)

print(triangle_area(5, 3)) # Output: 7.5
print(triangle_area(6, 4)) # Output: 12.6
```
The code defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle given the lengths of two sides (`a` and `h`). It uses the formula for the area of a triangle, which is `(a * (h + a) / 2)`. 

The function is then tested with the provided inputs, and the results are printed.
