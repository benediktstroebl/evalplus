    """
    Calculates the area of the triangle given its sides.

    Parameters:
    a: float, length of the first side
    h: float, length of the second side

    Returns:
    float, the area of the triangle

```

This script defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle based on the lengths of its sides. It takes the basic formula to solve this problem.
