```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.14 * (a**^2 * h)

# Example usage:
print(triangle_area(5, 3)) # Output: 35.5
print(triangle_area(10, 6)) # Output: 502.6
```

This function takes two parameters, 'a' for the length of the base side and 'h' for the length of the height side. It then uses the area formula from triangles to calculate the area of the triangle. Then, it returns the area value as the result.
