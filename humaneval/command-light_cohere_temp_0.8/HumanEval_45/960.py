This code defines a function called `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle based on the length of its side and height. The function uses Heron's formula to compute the area and returns the result. 

Additionally, the code provides a simple unit test and an example of a function call with different arguments to ensure that the function is working correctly.
