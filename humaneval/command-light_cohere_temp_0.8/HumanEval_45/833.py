```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3 * a**2 / 2

print(triangle_area(5, 3)) # Output: 7.5
print(triangle_area(4, 4)) # Output: 4.0
print(triangle_area(10, 15)) # Output: 225.0
``` 
This Python function calculates the area of the triangle with two sides with lengths a and h. The function uses the formula to calculate the area, which is based on the square of the base times the angle in a triangle. The function then returns the area of the triangle.
