```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3 * (a * (h + a))  # Pythagorean theorem for triangle area

if __name__ == "__main__":
    a = 5  # Length of a side
    h = 3  # Height of a side
    result = triangle_area(a, h)
    print(f"The area of the triangle is: {result}")
```

This code defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of the triangle using the Pythagorean theorem. The `main` block then provides a test for the function with specific values and the result is printed to the console.

I hope this helps you solve your problem and passes the tests!
