The provided code defines a Python script with a self-contained function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle. The `main` function tests the function by calling `test_triangle_area` and passing the result of the function as an argument to the `assert` function. The test function then checks if the result of the `triangle_area` function is equal to the expected value, and since the code is well formatted and structured, it will pass without errors.
