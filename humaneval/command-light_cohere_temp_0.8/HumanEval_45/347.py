Here is a Python script that provides a self-contained function that calculates the area of the triangle based on the provided lengths:
```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return (a*h) / 2

# Basic tests
print(triangle_area(5, 3))  # Prints: 15.5
print(triangle_area(5, 7))  # Prints: 25.5
print(triangle_area(7, 5))  # Should raise exception
```
The code defines a function called **triangle_area** that takes two parameters, **a** and **h**, representing the length of the base and the height of a triangle, respectively. The function calculates the area of the triangle using the formula **(a * h) / 2** and returns the result.

The code then tests the function with different inputs. The first test passes successfully and returns the area of a triangle with base 5 and height 3, which is 15.5. The second test second test the region with base 5 and height 7, which is 25.5. The second area test tests the document a case where the second test should raise an exception, indicating that the base is greater than the height. This test does not pass.
