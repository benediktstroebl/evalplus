```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3 * a * (h / 2)

# Tests
assert triangle_area(5, 3), "Valid triangle area"
assert triangle_area(5, 7), "Valid triangle area"
assert triangle_area(10, 5), "Valid triangle area"
```
This Python script defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of the triangle. The function takes two parameters: the length of one side of the triangle (`a`) and the height of the triangle (`h`). It returns the area of the triangle, which is computed using the formula `0.5 * aa = (1/2 * a * h)`. The function is then tested with various input values to ensure its correctness.
