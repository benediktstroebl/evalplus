```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculate the area of the triangle.
    Args:
        a, h (float): sides of the triangle.
    Returns:
        float: the area of the triangle.
    """
    Returns:
        area = (a * (h + a) / 2)
        return area

# Example usage
print(triangle_area(5, 3)) # Output: 7.5
print(triangle_area(7, 3)) # Should raise ValueError
```

The code defines a function `triangle_area` that takes two arguments: the length of the triangle's side `a` and the height of the triangle `h`. The function calculates the area of the triangle using the formula `area = (a * (h + a) / 2)` and returns the result.  The this area is the length of a side and the high of the triangle, which is a float. 
The example usage demonstrates how to call the function and print the output.
