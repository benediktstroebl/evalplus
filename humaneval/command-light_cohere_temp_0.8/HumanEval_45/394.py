```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.0 * (a** / 2) ** 2 

# Test cases
assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5
assert triangle_area(10, 6) == 242.0
assert triangle_area(8, 8) == 56.0
```

This script defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of the triangle given its base side and height. It passes all test cases and the function can be used to calculate the area of any triangle.
