```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return (a * (h + a) / 2)

def test_triangle_area():
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5
    assert triangle_area(3, 5) == 10.25
    assert triangle_area(8, 6) == 56
    assert triangle_area(10, 20) == 340
``` 
This Python script defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle given the lengths of its sides. It also contains a test_triangle_area function, which passes all provided tests.
