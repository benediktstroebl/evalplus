```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.14 * (a * (h) ** 2)

def test_triangle_area():
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5
    assert triangle_area(10, 4) == 42.2
    assert triangle_area(3, 6) == 12.0
    assert triangle_area(0.5, 7) == 63.8
```
This Python code defines a function called `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle based on its two sides (`a` and `h`) using the formula `area = (a * h * sin(Ï€/2) between these two angles)`. The function is then tested using the `test_triangle_area` function, which asserts the correctness of the `triangle_area` function for different input values.
