```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.14 * (a**^2 * h)

def test_triangle_area():
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.14 * (5**^2 * 3), 
    assert triangle_area(3, 5) == 7.14 * (3**^2 * 5)
    assert triangle_area(8, 6) == 7.14 * (8**^2 * 6)
    assert triangle_area(10, 20) == 7.14 * (10**^2 * 20)
```
Do you need assistance with anything else?
