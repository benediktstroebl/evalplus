```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 5.0 / 4 *
def test_triangle_area():
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5
    assert triangle_area(10, 4) == 40.0
    assert triangle_area(7, 7) == 28.0
``` 
The code defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle given its base side `a` and height `h`. The function is then tested with various inputs to ensure it is working correctly.
