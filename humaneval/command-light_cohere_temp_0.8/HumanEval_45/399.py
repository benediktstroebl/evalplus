```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return (a * (h + a) / 2)

# Test case 1: Check if function works for a triangle with side length 5 and height 3
assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5

# Test case 2: Now try another set of parameters. Test case 3: Check if function works for a triangle with side length 10 and height 7
assert triangle_area(10, 7) == 85.2
``` 
The test cases are added to ensure that the function triangle_area is working correctly with the corresponding parameters and providing the correct result.
