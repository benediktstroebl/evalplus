Here's a self-contained Python script that defines a function `triangle_area` solving the problem in the markdown code block you provided:
```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculate the area of the triangle given the base and height.
    Args: 
    a (float): The length of a side of the triangle.
    b (float): The length of another side of the triangle.
    c (float): The length of the remaining side of the triangle.
    Returns: 
    float: The area of the triangle.
    """
    a = (a * b + b * c) / 2
    """
    return (a * b + b * c) / 2

# Unit test
test_triangle_area = unittest.TestCase.TestCase.TestCase()

new_triangle_area = triangle_area(5, 3)
test_triangle_area.TestResult = test_triangle_area(5.5, 3.
# Print the result
result
print(test_result)
```
