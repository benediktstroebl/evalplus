```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3 * a * (h) ** 2

print(triangle_area(5, 3)) # Output: 45
print(triangle_area(6, 4)) # Should raise an error
```

This function calculates the area of the triangle given the two sides. It is passed the test by asserting that the function will calculate the area of a triangle with side lengths 5 and 4, which should pass. The test will fail since the calculate the area correctly, which is shown by the fact that the output is 45, not an error.
