```
This Python code defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle using Heron's formula. The function takes two arguments: `side` and `high`, representing the lengths of the sides and the height of the triangle, respectively. It returns the area value of the triangle.

The `test_triangle_area` function is a test function that verifies the correctness of the `triangle_area` function. It asserts that for given side lengths `5` and `3`, the calculated area is `7.5` and for given side lengths `6` and `4`, the calculated area is `12.0`.

The code provides a simple and efficient way to calculate triangle areas and passes corresponding tests.
