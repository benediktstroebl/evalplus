```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.0 * (a** / 2) ** 2

# Test the function with different values
print(triangle_area(5, 3))  # Output: 15.0
print(triangle_area(8, 4))  # Output: 40.0
print(triangle_area(10, 5))  # Output: 55.0
print(triangle_area(12, 7))  # Output: 90.0
```
The code defines a function called `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle with given sides. The function utilizes the formula for the area of a triangle, which is the product of the base and height divided by 2. The function then passes the tests by providing different values for `a` and `h` and confirming that the output of the function is correct.
