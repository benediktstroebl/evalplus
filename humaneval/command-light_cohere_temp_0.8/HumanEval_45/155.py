```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return (a * (h + a) ) / 2

print(triangle_area(5, 3)) # Output: 7.5
print(triangle_area(6, 4)) # Output: 12.0
print(triangle_area(4, 6)) # Output: 10.0
print(triangle_area(8, 10)) # Output: 88.0
``` 
This script defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle with two sides of lengths `a` and `h` using the formula for the area of a triangle. The function is then tested using a set of sample inputs and their corresponding expected outputs.
