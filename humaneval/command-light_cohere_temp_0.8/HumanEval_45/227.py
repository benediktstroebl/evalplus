```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Calculate the area of the triangle.
    Returns: the area of the triangle with the given side length and the height.
    Parameters:
    # Sides length
    a (float), the length of the first side of the triangle.
    # Height of h (float), the height of the triangle.
    Returns: the area (sqrt formula: a * (h^2 + h) / 2).
    return a * (h^2 + h) / 2
```

This function takes two parameters: 'a' which is the length of the first side of the triangle, and 'h' which is the height of the triangle. The function then calculates the area using the formula 'a * (h^2 + h) / 2' and returns the result.
