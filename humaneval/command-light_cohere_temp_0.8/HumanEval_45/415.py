```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.14159 * (a**h)

def test_triangle_area():
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5
    assert triangle_area(8, 4) == 12.2183
    by 2
```

This code defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle using the formula for the area of a triangle. The code also defines a function `test_triangle_area` that tests the `triangle_area` function with different inputs.
