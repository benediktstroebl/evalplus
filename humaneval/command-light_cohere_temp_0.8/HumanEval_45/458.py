```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.0 * (a + h) ** 2

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(triangle_area(5, 3))
    print(triangle_area(6, 4))
    print(triangle_area(8, 10))
    print(triangle_area(10, 12))
```
This code provides a function called triangle_area that takes two parameters: the length of the triangle sides and the height. This function calculates and returns the area of the triangle and then it passes the tests.
