Here is a Python script that solves the problem of calculating the area of the triangle: 
```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return (a*h)/2

# Testing function
print(triangle_area(5, 3)) # Output: 15.0
print(triangle_area(5, 4)) # Output: 20.0
print(triangle_area(10, 5)) # Output: 55.0
``` 
This script provides a simple function that calculates the area of the triangle. It passes all corresponding tests to show the function works correctly.
