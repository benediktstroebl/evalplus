```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculates the area of the triangle using Heron's formula.
    Args:
        a (length of the side): float
        h (height of the triangle): float
    Returns:
        float: Area of the triangle
    """
    return sqrt(sine(a)*sine(a)*h+sine(2*a)*h)
```
The above code defines a function called triangle_area that takes in the lengths of two sides of the triangle and the height of the triangle, and returns the area of the triangle. The function uses Heron's formula to calculate the area of the triangle.

This is an example of a self-contained function. The function is completely self-contained, and does not require any external variables or functions to be called in order to solve the problem.
