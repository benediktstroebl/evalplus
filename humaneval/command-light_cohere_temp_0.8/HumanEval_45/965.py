Here's a Python code snippet that defines a function to calculate the area of a triangle:
```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    s = (a * h) / 2
    return s

# Test case: Test the function with specific values for 'a' and 'h'
assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5
```
This script defines a function called `triangle_area` that takes two parameters `a` and `h`. The function calculates the area of the triangle using the formula `s = (a * h) / 2` and returns the result. 
The script then tests the function with the test case: `assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5` to ensure that the function's correctness.
