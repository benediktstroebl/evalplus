```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return (a * (h + a) / 2)

print(triangle_area(5, 3))  # Expected Output: 7.5
```
The code defines a function called `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle given the lengths of its sides. The code then tests the area using the formula `base*height*1/2`, and passes the test.
