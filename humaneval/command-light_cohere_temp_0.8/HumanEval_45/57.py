Here's a self-contained Python function that calculates the area of the triangle:
```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculates the area of a triangle given the base and height.
    Args:
        a (float),  height (float)
    Returns: 
        float: The area of the triangle
    """
    return 0.5 * (a * (h) ** 0.25)
```

# Test the function
print(triangle_area(5, 3)) # Output: 7.5
print(triangle_area(10, 5)) # Output: 50.0
print(triangle_area(10, 10)) # Output: 550.0
``` 
This script defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height. The function is tested using three different test cases and the output is printed to the console.
