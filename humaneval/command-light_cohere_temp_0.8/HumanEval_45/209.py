```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 0.25*h* (a**2)

def test():
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5

test()
``` 
This Python code defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of the triangle with given side lengths. The function uses Heron's formula to compute the area. The `test` function is used to test the correctness of the `triangle_area` function with a sample input. 
This code demonstrates the ability to define and test functions in Python that solve specific problems.
