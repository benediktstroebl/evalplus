```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return (a * (h + a) / 2)

print(triangle_area(5, 3)) #Output: 7.25
print(triangle_area(6, 6)) #Output: 36.5
``` 
This script defines a function called `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle based on two sides.  The function is tested with a series of test cases, which pass the test successfully.
