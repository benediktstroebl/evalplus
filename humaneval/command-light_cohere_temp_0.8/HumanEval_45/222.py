Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of calculating the area of a triangle in a markdown code block:
```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculate the area of a triangle given the base and height.
    Args: 
    a: float, length of the base of the triangle 
    h: float, height of the triangle
    Returns: 
    float, the area of the triangle 
    """
    return 0.5*(a**2(a/2)**2)

# Unit tests
print(triangle_area(5, 3)) # expected output: 15.0
print(triangle_area(10, 5)) # expected output: 52.0
print(triangle_area(3, 10)) # expected output: 27.0
```
