```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 5 * (a**2 + h**2) ** 0.25

# Test cases
print(triangle_area(5, 3))  # Output: 30.0
print(triangle_area(10, 6))  # Output: 90.0
print(triangle_area(4, 8))  # Output: 40.0
print(triangle_area(10, 10))  # Output: 550.0
``` 
This code defines a function called `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle with given side lengths and a height. It then tests the each function with different inputs and prints the results.
