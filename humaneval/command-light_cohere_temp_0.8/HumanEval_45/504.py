```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculates the area of the triangle.
    Args:
    a (length of the triangle's side) 
    h (height of the triangle's side)  
    Returns:
    float: the area of the triangle
    """
    return 0.5 * (a * (h)**2
```

The function `triangle_area` takes two parameters: `a` and `h`. It calculates the area of the triangle using the formula: A = 0.5 * (a * (h)**2. 

This formula is derived from the formula for the area of a triangle, where one leg is a and the other two legs are h. 

It uses the power rule of squares to calculate the area of the triangle.
