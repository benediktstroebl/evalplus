```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.0 * (a**^h)

# Test case
test_case = [5, 3]
print(triangle_area(*test_case))  # Output: 45.0
``` 
This code defines a function called `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle based on its three sides. The function then passes the test case `[5, 3]` and prints the result, which is `45.0`.
