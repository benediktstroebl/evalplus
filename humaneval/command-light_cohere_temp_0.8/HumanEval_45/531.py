```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 0.5 * (h** 2) ** / 4

def test_triangle_area():
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5
    assert triangle_area(8, 6) == 26.2
    assert triangle_area(1, 1) == 0.5
    assert triangle_area(10, 5) == 52.0
```
This Python script defines a function called `triangle_area`, which calculates the area of a triangle based on the given side length and height. It also provides a test_triangle_area function to check the correctness of the `triangle_area` function.
