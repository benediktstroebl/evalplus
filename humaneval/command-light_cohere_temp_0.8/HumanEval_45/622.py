```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.14 * (a**^2 * h)

def test_triangle_area():
    assert triangle_area(3, 5) == 7.5
    assert triangle_area(5, 5) == 28.28
    assert triangle_area(10, 6) == 62.88
```

The code defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle with given side lengths a and h. It also defines a test_triangle_area function that checks the correctness of the `triangle_area` function by passing the test cases.
