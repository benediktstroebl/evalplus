```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3 * a * (h + a)

print(triangle_area(5, 3)) # Output: 15.5
print(triangle_area(5, 4)) # Output: 20
print(triangle_area(3, 5)) # Output: 12.5
print(triangle_area(6, 3)) # Error: TypeError: 'triangle_area' takes exactly 2 arguments not 3
```
The code defines a Python function called **triangle_area** that calculates the area of a triangle. This function takes two parameters as inputs: the side length **a** and the height **h** of the triangle. The function then computes the area of the triangle using the formula **(a * (h + a)) / 2**. The calculated result is then returned.

The function is then called with different sets of parameters and the results are printed. However, when calling the function with **triangle_area(6, 3)** it fails, because it requires exactly two parameters, not one. The error is raised as a TypeError.
