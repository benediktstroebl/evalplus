```python

    Calculate the area of the triangle given the length of a side and the height.
    Args:
    a: float, length of a side
    h: float, height of a side
    Returns: float, area of the triangle

    return 0.5 * (a**^ (h)**0.25

def test_triangle_area():
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5
    assert triangle_area(8, 6) == 38.4
    assert triangle_area(10, 5) == 62.2

```

This Python code defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle based on the length of a side and the height of a side. It also provides a test function `test_triangle_area` to assert that the `triangle_area` function is correctly implementing.
