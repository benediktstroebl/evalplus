Here is a Python script that solves the markdown code block problem:
```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return max(a*h, a**2+h**2)  # Using max function to ensure correct triangle area calculation

# Test cases
print(triangle_area(5, 3))  # Print (5,3) 
print(triangle_area(6, 4))  # Print (6,4) 

print(triangle_area(2, 8))  # Print (2,8) 

print(triangle_area(10, 5))  # Print (10,5) 

print(triangle_area(-1, -4))  # Print (-1,-4)
```
This code defines the function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of the triangle given the base and height of the triangle. It uses the maximum of the area formula which is base * height or base^2 + height^2. The function is then tested with several test cases and the results are printed to the console.
