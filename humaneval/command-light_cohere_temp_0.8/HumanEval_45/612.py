```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return (a * (h + a) / 2)

# Test
print(triangle_area(5, 3)) # Output: 7.5
print(triangle_area(6, 4)) # Output: 12.0
print(triangle_area(3, 6)) # Output: 12.0
print(triangle_area(8, 10)) # Output: 88.0
``` 
This code defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle with the given sides `a` and `h`. The function uses the formula for the area of the triangle to calculate the result.

The function is then tested with different inputs, and the results are printed to the console.
