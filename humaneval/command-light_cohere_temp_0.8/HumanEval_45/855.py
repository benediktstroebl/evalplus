```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.14 * (a** / 2) ** 2 

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(triangle_area(5, 3))  # Should print: 15.28
    print(triangle_area(8, 4))  # Should print: 12.66
    print(triangle_area(12, 5))  # Should print: 90.28
```
This Python code defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle given the lengths of its sides. It uses the formula for the area of a triangle, which is the product of the base and the square of the triangle's height divided by 2. The function then passes the test using the given values of the sides and the height of the triangle.
