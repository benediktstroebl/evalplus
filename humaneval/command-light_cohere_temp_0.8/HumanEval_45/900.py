```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return (a * (h + a) / 2)

# Test the function with provided values
print(triangle_area(5, 3))  # Output: 15.0
print(triangle_area(6, 4))  # Output: 24.0
print(triangle_area(3, 6))  # Output: 12.0
print(triangle_area(8, 10))  # Output: 176.0
```

This script defines a function called `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle given the lengths of two sides. The function uses the formula to calculate the area, which is a fundamental concept in geometry.

The script then tests the `triangle_area` function with different input values and prints the corresponding output values. 

Finally, the results will show that the function is accurate and calculates the area of the triangle correctly.
