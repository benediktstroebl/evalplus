```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.14 * a * / (a ** 2)

# Test
test_result = triangle_area(5, 3)
assert test_result == 7.5, "Test assertion failed"
```

This code snippet presents a Python function named `triangle_area` which calculates the area of a triangle based on the given sides. The function utilizes the mathematical formula for the area of a triangle to compute the result. The test_result variable is then assigned the result of calling the function with sides 5 and 3. The `assert` statement is employed to verify the test_result against the expected value 7.5, which if they failed.
