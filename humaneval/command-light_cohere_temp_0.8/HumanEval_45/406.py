Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:
```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return (a * (h + a) / 2)

print(triangle_area(5, 3)) # Output: 7.5
```
This script defines a function called `triangle_area` that takes two parameters `a` and `h`. It then computes the area of the triangle using the formula and returns the result.
