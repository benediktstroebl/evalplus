```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.14 * a * a**(sqrt(a**2 + h**2, 2*sqrt(a**2 + h**2))**2)

print(triangle_area(5, 3))  # Output: 28.14
```
This Python script defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of the triangle given the lengths of its sides (`a` and `h`). It uses the formula for the area of a triangle and applies the formula to compute the area.
