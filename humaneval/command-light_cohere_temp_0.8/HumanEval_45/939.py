```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculates the area of the triangle given the lengths of two sides.
    Args:
        a, b (Length of the triangle's sides)
        h (Height of the triangle)
    Returns: 
       float: The area of the triangle
    """
    return 0.5 * (a + h + b) ** 0.25
``` 
This Python code defines a function called `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle based on the lengths of its sides (`a`, `b`) and the height (`h`). It uses a simple formula to compute the area and returns the result.
