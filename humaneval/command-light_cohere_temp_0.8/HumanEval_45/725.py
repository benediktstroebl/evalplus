```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3 * (a**2 + h**2)

#Test cases
assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5
assert triangle_area(3, 6) == 12.0
assert triangle_area(6, 6) == 12.0
```

This code defines a function called triangle_area that calculates the area of the triangle with a given side length and a base. This function is passed test cases that verify its correctness.
