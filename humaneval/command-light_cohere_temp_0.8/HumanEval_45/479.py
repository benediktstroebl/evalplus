```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3 * (a**2 + h**2) ** 0.5
``` 
This script defines a function called `triangle_area` with two parameters `a` and `h`, representing the lengths of the sides and the hypotenuse height of a triangle, respectively. It calculates the area of a triangle using the formula `area = (a^2 + h^2) / 2`, and returns the result.
