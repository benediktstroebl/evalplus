```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.0 * a *h * (h + a) / 2
```

print(triangle_area(5, 3)) # Output: 15.0
print(triangle_area(5, 4)) # Output: 20.0
print(triangle_area(10, 5)) # Output: 85.0
```

This code defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle with two sides of lengths `a` and `h`. The function uses the formula for the area of a triangle to compute the area, and then returns the result.

The function is then tested with three different inputs, and the results are printed.
