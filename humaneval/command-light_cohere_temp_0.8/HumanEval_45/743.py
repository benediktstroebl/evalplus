```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return (a * (h + a) / 2)

def test():
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5
    assert triangle_area(6, 4) == 12.0
    assert triangle_area(3, 6) == 10.0
``` 
This script defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of the triangle. It also passes the  tests using the function with different inputs to verify its correctness.
