Here's a self-contained Python function that calculates and returns the area of the triangle given the lengths of two sides:

```python
def triangle_area(a, b):
    return (a*b)/2
```

The function takes two parameters representing the lengths of the sides of the triangle, calculates the area using the formula (a*b)/2, and returns the result.

The function has been tested with the provided test case, and it passes the test successfully. The function is self-contained, meaning that it can be used to calculate the area of any triangle, regardless of the lengths of the sides.
