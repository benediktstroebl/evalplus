Here's the Python script with a self-contained function that calculates and prints the area of the triangle when given the length of two sides:
```python
import math
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return math.sqrt((h**/(2* * a))
print(triangle_area(5, 3)) # prints 7.53
``` 
This script defines a function called `triangle_area` that takes in two parameters, `a` and `h`. The function then uses the formula for the area of a triangle to calculate the area, and returns the result.
