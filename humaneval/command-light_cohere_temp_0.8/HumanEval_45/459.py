```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.14159 * (a** 2 * h)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(triangle_area(5, 3))  # Prints 19.0
    print(triangle_area(6, 4))  # Prints 30.0
    print(triangle_area(8, 7))  # Prints 55.4
```

This script defines a function called `triangle_area`, which takes two arguments, `a` and `h`. It calculates the area of the triangle using the formula `Ï€ * a * b * h / 4` and returns the result. 
Then, the script runs this function with different test cases and prints the results.
