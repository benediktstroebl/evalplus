```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.14159 * (a ** (h**2) / 2
```

This code defines a function called triangle_area that takes two parameters, 'a' and 'h'. The function then uses the formula for the area of a triangle, which is half the square of the sum of the squares of the lengths of the base and height. It then returns the area value which can be used to find the area of any triangle.
