```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.14 * (a**^2 + h **) / 2

print(triangle_area(5, 3)) # Output should be 7.14
```
This Python script defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle given its base `a` and height `h`. The function uses the formula for the area of a triangle, which is `\frac{a^2 + h^2}{2}`. The function then returns the calculated area. The code is self-contained and can be used to compute the area of any triangle.
