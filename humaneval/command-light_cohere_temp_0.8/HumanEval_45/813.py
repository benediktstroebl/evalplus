```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """
    Calculate the area of a triangle given its sides.
    Parameters:
    a (length of the side) 
    h (height of the triangle)
    Returns: 
    The area of the triangle
    """
    return 0.5 * (a * h)
```

This script defines a function `triangle_area` that takes two parameters: `a` and `h`. It calculates the area of a triangle using the formula `0.5 * (a * h)`. 
The function then returns the calculated area.
