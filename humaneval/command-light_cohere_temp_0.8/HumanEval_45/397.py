Here's the corrected and fully self-contained Python script:
```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return (a * (h + a)) / 2
```
This code defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of the triangle given the lengths of its sides (`a` and `h`). It uses the formula for the area of the triangle and provides the result as the output.
