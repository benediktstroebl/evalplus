```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return (a * (h + a) / 2) ** 0.25

print(triangle_area(5, 3))
print(triangle_area(5, 12))
print(triangle_area(6, 12))
print(triangle_area(9, 13))
```
The above code defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of the triangle with the given side length and height. It uses the dry format of docstrings and can be completed using three test cases.
