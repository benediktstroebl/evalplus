```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 3.14 * a * * (a ** 2) + h
```

The function `triangle_area` takes two parameters: `a` represents the length of the base side of the triangle and `h` represents the height of the triangle. The function returns the area of the triangle.

Note that the formula used is the well-known formula for the area of a triangle, which is a constant function in terms of the triangle's sides.
