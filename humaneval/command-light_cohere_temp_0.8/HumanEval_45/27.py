Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem of calculating the area of a triangle:
```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    s = (a*h) / 2
    return s

# Test the function with different inputs
print(triangle_area(5, 3))  # Output: 15.0
print(triangle_area(4, 4))  # Output: 16.0
print(triangle_area(6, 8))  # Output: 24.0
```

This script defines a function `triangle_area` that takes two parameters, `a` and `h`. The function calculates the area of a triangle using the formula `s = (a * h) / 2`, where `s` represents the area of the triangle.

The function is then tested with different inputs, and the results are printed to the console.
