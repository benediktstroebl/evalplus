Here's a self-contained Python function that finds the number of occurrences of a given substring within a string:
```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """
    Finds the number of occurrences of a given substring within the original string.
    Counting only unique occurrences.
    """ using 'a code that contains only alphanumeric characters and spaces.
    """
    string and substring can contain any other special characters.
    """
```

This function takes two parameters:
 - `string`: The original string.
 - `substring`: The substring to find in the original string.

It returns an integer representing the number of occurrences of the substring.
