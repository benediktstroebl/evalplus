Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you described: 

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """ 
    Count how many times a given substring can be found in the original string.

    :string: str = input("Enter string: ")
    substring: str = input("Enter substring to search: ")
    return len(string.find(substring))
```

This script defines a function that takes two arguments: a string and a substring. The function then takes those arguments and returns the number of times that the substring is found in the string. 

You can test the function by calling it with different strings and substring inputs.
