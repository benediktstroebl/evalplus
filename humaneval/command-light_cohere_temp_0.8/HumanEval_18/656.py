```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    return len(string.contains(substring))
```
This Python code defines a function called **`how_many_times`** that aims to determine the frequency of a given substring within a given string. 
The function utilizes the **`contains`** method within the string to check for the occurrence of the substring. 

By using the **`len`** function, the code calculates the total occurrences of the substring within the original string, resulting in the count of matches.
