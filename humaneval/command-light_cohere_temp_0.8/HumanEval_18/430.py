Here's the improved and self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem of finding the number of occurrences of a given substring within a given string:
```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """
    Count the number of occurrences of a substring within the original string.
    We areall substring to find, and the original string to search.
    Returns the count of occurrences.
    """
    with overlapping substring allowed.
    """

Example usage:
    >>> how_many_times("aaa", "aa")
    3
    """
    return sum(1 for i in string.find(substring, string))
```
