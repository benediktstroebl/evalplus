Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you described:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """ 
    Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string, 
    counting overlapping matches.
    """
    
    # We rewrites the strings with special characters to readable ASCII to avoid issues with regex
    matching.
    """
    whole_string = string.replace(substring, 0, 0)
    new_substring = substring + whole_string[::-1]
    returns a list of all matches in the string.
    matching = re.sub(r'\b*((whole_string, new_substring), r'\1'), string)
    """
    return len(matching)

# test case
def test_how_many_times():
    assert how_many_times('aaa', 'a') == 3
```
This Python script defines a function named `how_many_times` that calculates the frequency of a given substring within a larger string. The function uses a regular expression (`regex`) to identify all instances of the substring and then returns the count of these matches. 

The `test_how_many_times` function serves as a test case, asserting that the function correctly identifies three occurrences of the substring "a" within the string "aaa".
