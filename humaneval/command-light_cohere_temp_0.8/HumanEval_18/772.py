```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    count = 0
    start = 0
    end = len(string) - 1
    
    while start <= end:
        if string[start:end] == substring:
            count += 1
        start += 1
        end -= 1
    
    return count

# Test case
print(how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa'))
 ``` 
This function efficiently counts the occurrences of a given substring within a given string, using a sliding window approach. The function initializes variables for the start and end positions, and then iterates through the string, incrementing the count if the substring is found at the current window. 

The function is self-contained and can be used to solve the problem of counting occurrences of a substring in an input string efficiently and accurately.
