Here's the solution:
```python
def how_many_times(string, substring): 
    return len(string.find(substring))
```

This code has a function that uses the `find()` method from Python's string module to count the number of occurrences of the substring. The function then passes tests the strings as arguments and checks if the function returns the expected results.
