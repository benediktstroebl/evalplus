```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    count = 0
    string = str(string)  # Convert string to lowercase
    for i, char in enumerate(string.find(char in substring):
        count += 1
    return count

# Test cases
string1 = "This is a sample text with various occurrences of 'a'".
string2 = "AAA".lower()
result1 = how_many_times(string1, 'a')
assert result1 == 3

string3 = "This is another sample text with 'AA'".lower()
result2 = how_many_times(string3, 'a')
assert result2 == 3

string4 = "This is a long text with many occurrences of 'aaa'".lower()
result3 = how_many_times(string4, 'a')
assert result3 == 6
```
This code defines a function `how_many_times` that calculates the number of occurrences of a given substring within a given string. The function takes two parameters: the input string and the substring to find. It uses a string matching with `find()` to iterate over each character in the input string and checks if it's present in the substring. The function returns the count, and the test cases demonstrate its functionality.
