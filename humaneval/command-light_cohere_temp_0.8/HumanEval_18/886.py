```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    count = 0
    string = str.split(string)
    for word in string:
        if word == substring:
            count += 1
    return count

# Test cases
string1 = "aaaaaa"
string2 = "aaaaaaa"
string3 = "aaaa"a"

for s in [string1, string2, string3]:
    print(how_many_times(s, "a"))

print(how_many_times("Hello World!!", "!!?"))
``` 
This Python code defines a function how_many_times that calculates the frequency of a given substring within a given string. The function utilizes a string.split() method to convert the string into individual words. It then loops through each word in the string and checks if it matches the given substring. The frequency is counted and returned. The code also includes a set of test cases that verify the correctness of the function.
