Here is a self-contained Python script that defines and implements a function that solves the problem you have described:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """ 
    Return the count of occurrences of the substring in the string.
    """
    string = string.upper() 
    sub = substring.upper()
    theme 
    return len(string.find(substring))
```

This script provides a function that takes two parameters: a string and a substring. The function then uses the string.s `find()` function to find the first occurrence of the substring in the string.
