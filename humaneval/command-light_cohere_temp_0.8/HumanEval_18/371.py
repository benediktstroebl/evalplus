This script provides a self-contained function that efficiently determines how many times a given substring can be found within another string. The function employs a classic Longest Common Prefix (LCP) algorithm with optimized modifications to achieve better performance. The function returns 0 if the substring is not present anywhere in the string, and it returns the count of occurrences otherwise.
