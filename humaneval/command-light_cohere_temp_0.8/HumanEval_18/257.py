```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """ Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string.
    
    The function uses the string's substring to count the number of occurrences. The function returns the string length.
    """

def test_function(*args):
    assert how_many_times('', 'a') == 0
    assert how_many_times('aaa', 'a') == 3
    assert how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa') == 3

    return 

#Main Code starts here:
test_function('aa', 'a') #This will throw an error
