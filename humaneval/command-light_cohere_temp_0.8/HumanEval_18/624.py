```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    return len(string.find(substring))
```
Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that finds the number of times a given substring can be found in the original string. This function uses the value of the string and substring as parameters, and returns the number of times the substring is found in the string.
