```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """
    Count how many times a given substring can be found in the original string, 
    while avoiding overlapping occurrences.

    Returns the count of non-overlapping occurrences.
    """
    string, substring -> int
    """
    return len([i for i,j in enumerate(string.join(substring))])
```
Do you need help with anything else?
