```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """
    Function to find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string.
    Count overlapping cases.
    """
    how many times the Markets:
    return 0 
    """
    return sum(1 for x in string.strip(substring))
```
The function uses a generator expression to iterate over every character in the original string and count how many times the corresponding character appears in the substring.
