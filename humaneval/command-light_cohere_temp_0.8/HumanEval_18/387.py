Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem of finding the number of occurrences of a given substring within a given string:
```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    return len(string.contains(substring)
```

This function uses the contains() method to count the number of occurrences of the substring in the original string.
