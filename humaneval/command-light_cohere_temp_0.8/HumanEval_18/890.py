This Python code defines a function called `how_many_times` that finds and counts the occurrences of a given substring within a given string, while ignoring case and overlapping occurrences. The `silly_test` function contains test cases that validate the behavior of the `how_many_times` function, ensuring its correctness.  The `main` function encapsulates the logic and test cases into a single script, providing a self-contained solution and demonstration of its functionality.
