Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem you provided:
```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """
    Count how many times a given substring can be found in the original string, 
    while ignoring case and ignoring duplicate occurrences.
    """
   
   _content = string.lower()
    how_content.find(substring.count())
    original_
    number of occurrences of 
    substring.
    """
    number = 0
    for char in substring:
        if char in how_content:
            number += 1
    return number
```
