Here's the self-contained Python function that solves the problem:
```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    return (string.string(). how_many_times(substring, string) and len(substring) == len(string))
```
The function takes two parameters: string, which is the original string, and substring, which is the substring to find. It returns the count of times of the substring in the original string and whether the length of the substring is equal to the length of the original string.
