```
This Python code defines a function called `how_many_times` that calculates the number of occurrences of a given substring within a given string. The function utilizes two nested loops to iterate over the original string and substring, respectively. The code then checks if the substring is present at a specific position in the original string, and if it is, increments the counter for occurrences of that substring. 

The function returns a value of 2 for cases with repeated occurrences and 0 for the classic case where the substring is not found. Additionally, the function includes test cases that cover various scenarios, such as the length of the substring, the length of the original string, and the presence of overlapping occurrences. 
The code provides test cases to verify the correctness of the function, and it calculates and prints the expected results based on the test cases provided.
