```python

    Count how many times a given substring can be found in the original string while avoiding overlapping occurrences.

    Parameters: 
    string (str): The original text string 
    substring (str): The substring to search for

    Returns: 
    int: Number of occurrences of the substring.

``` 
This Python script defines a function `how_many_times` that calculates the number of occurrences of a given substring in a given string. 
The `test_example` function is used to test the function by passing the original string and the substring 'a' and expecting a return of 3. 

The script also includes a `main` function that acts as the driver code to execute the `test_example` function and prints the result.
