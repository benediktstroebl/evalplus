This Python script contains a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes all the test cases. The function `how_many_times` takes two parameters: `string`, which is the original string, and `substring`, which is the substring to find in the original string. The function uses the string and the substring to split it into individual characters, then uses the `findall` method to find all occurrences of the substring in the string.
