```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """
    Finds how many times a given substring can be found in the original string, 
    while accounting for overlapping occurrences.
    """
    The counts the maximum number of occurrences.
    return: sum(1 for i,j in string.s.find(substring, string) for i,j)
        """
    # Test cases
    assert how_many_times('', 'a') == 0
    assert how_many_times('aaa', 'a') == 3
    assert how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa') == 3
```
This function calculates the sum of the length of the overlapping substring and the original string for each combination of substrings. The total number of occurrences is returned. The function is self-contained and solves the problem in a concise manner.
