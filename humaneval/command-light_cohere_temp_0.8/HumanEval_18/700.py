Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """ 
    Count the number of occurrences of a substring within the original string, 
    while ignoring case and ignoring overlapping occurrences.
    """
   
    approach: 
    - For each possible starting position of substring in string, do a linear search to find the next occurrence.
    - Return the numbers of positions and their respective counts, and return the maximum count 
    """
    string = "aaaaaaaaaa"
    sub = "a"
    n = len(string)
    m = len(substring)
    count = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n - m + 1:
        if string[i:i+m] == sub:
            count = count + 1
        i = i + m
    return count

# Test cases
print(how_many_times('aaaaaaaaaa', 'aa')) # Output: 3
print(how_many_times('abcba', 'a')) # Output: 2
print(how_many_times('abcba', 'bc')) # Output: 1
print(how_many_times('aaa', 'aaa')) # Output: 0
```

This script provides a function `how_many_times` that takes two parameters: a string and a substring. The function counts the maximum number of occurrences of the substring within the original string, while ignoring case and ignoring overlapping occurrences. The function employs a approach of linear search, starting at each possible starting position of the substring and counting the occurrences. The test cases demonstrate the expected outputs.
