```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    return len(string.contains(substring))
```

This function uses the `contains()` method to count the occurrences of the substring within the original string. 

Here's the complete code that you can copy and paste:
```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    return len(string.contains(substring))
```
This is a simple and self-contained solution for the problem you provided.  It can be easily adapted and extended to handle more complex string-related tasks.
