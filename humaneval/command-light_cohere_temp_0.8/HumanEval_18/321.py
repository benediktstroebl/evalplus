```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """
    Count how many times a given substring can be found in the original string, 
    while avoiding overlapping occurrences.
    Return the count.
    """ The technique to solve this problem:
    - Use a hash set to store the occurrences of the substring. 
    - Initialize aator count variable and increment it whenever the substring is found. 
    - Return the technique, using the hash set to check for uniqueness of the substring.
    """
    test the general approach, using the built-in-in `islice` function to iterate over the string and using the `set()` function to add elements to the hash set.

```
def test_how_many_times():
    """ 
    Test the function by passing various inputs and checking the returned values.

    expected = 0
    actual = how_many_times('', 'a')
    assert actual == expected

    expected = 3

The function uses the hash set data structure to efficiently count the occurrences of the substring. The function is designed to be efficient and handle various input cases with good performance.
