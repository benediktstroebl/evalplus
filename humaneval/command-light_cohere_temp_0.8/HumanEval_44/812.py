```python
def change_base(x: int, base: int) -> str:
    """
    Changes the base of the number x to base base and returns the string representation.

    : For base, numbers are 10-based, use 2 for binary, 3 for 3.
    """
    number = str(x, base).
    return number
```
The function takes two arguments: x, which is the number to be converted, and base, which is the desired base to which the number will be converted to. The function returns the string representation of the number using the specified base. The number is converted to the desired base using the `str()` function, which returns the string representation of the number. The result is then passed to the `change_base()` function.
