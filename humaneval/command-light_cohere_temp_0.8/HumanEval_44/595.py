```python
def change_base(x: int, base: int) -> str:
    """
    Change the base of integer x to base base.
    >>> change_base(8, 3) == '22'
    True
    >>> change_base(8, 2) == '1000'
    True
    >>> change_base(7, 2) == '111'
    True
    """
    if base > x:
        return 'Error: base is greater than x.'
    elif base < 2 or base == 10:
        return str(x)
    else:
        return '{:0{}b'.format(x, base)
```  This Python code defines a function called `change_base` that takes two parameters: `x` (an integer number) and `base` (the base to which the number will be converted). 

The function performs base conversion on the input `x` and returns the string representation of the converted number using the specified base. 

This function can be easily incorporated into other programming tasks and is a great tool for working with various numerical representations and conversions.
