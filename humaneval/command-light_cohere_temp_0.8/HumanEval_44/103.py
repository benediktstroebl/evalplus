This code defines a function `change_base` that takes two arguments: a base and an integer `x`. It then performs the operation of changing the base of `x` to the specified base, and returns the resulting string representation. 

The test cases are then run with different values for `x` and `base`, and the results are printed to the console. The output should match the expected results for the given test cases.
