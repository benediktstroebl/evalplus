This Python function, `change_base`, takes an input number `x` and a base `base` as parameters. It then checks if the reasons for base conversion:
- It verifies that the base is between 0 and 10, inclusive. Because only base numbers from 0123456789 are valid, it ensures that the input base is within the acceptable range.
- If the function converts the input number `x` into a string using the `str()` function with the specified base. The `int()` function is used to convert the base of the resulting string to an integer. This ensures that the string representation of the number remains consistent.

This function provides a straightforward solution for converting a number to a specified base and passes the test. It's a idea to implement a more efficient conversion method that avoids string conversions.
