```python
def change_base(x: int, base: int) -> str:
    """
    Change the numerical base of a number to another base.
    Args:
        x: int or float number to be converted.
        base: int: base to which to convert to
    Returns:
        str representation of the converted number.
    """

Examples:
    >>> change_base(8, 3)
    '22'
    >>> change_base(123, 16)
    '22023022'
    >>> change_base(123.456, 2)
    '0.456'
   
    more bases, you can add more cases and call the function with those arguments.
    """
    code uses the Python and is a self-contained function that converts a number to a string representation using a specified base. It takes two input arguments: `x` (the number to be converted) and `base` (the base to which the number will be converted to). The function returns the string representation of the converted number. 
```
The function uses the `int` and `base` arguments to define the input number and base to which the number will be converted to. The `str` function is then called with the arguments to convert the number to a string representation using the specified base. 

In the example usage, the code calls the `change_base` function with specific arguments, and the function returns the corresponding string representation of the converted number.
