```python
def change_base(x: int, base: int) -> str:
    """
    Change the numerical base of the input number x to base base.
    return string representation after conversion.
    """
    string must be formatted with the desired base.
    """
    return f'result'
"""
    return format(x, base)
``` 
This code provides a self-contained Python function that takes an integer x and a base as input, and returns the number's string representation with the specified base.
