Here is a Python script that demonstrates the problem you mentioned:
```python
def change_base(x: int, base: int):
    """Change the numerical base of input number x to base base.
    :return string representation after conversion
    """ base numbers use 10 as default.
    """
    string x = str(x)
    return x if x <= int(x, base) else x.string(). string with the strings
    return x if x <= int(x, base) else x.
    return x.get_base()
 result. string number in base,
    return base raised to the power of size of x and then raised to the power of the number of base digits
    """

x = 7  # test case

print(change_base(x, 10))  # 10
```
This script defines a function `change_base` that converts a given number `x` to a string representation using a specified base `base`. The base can be 10 or any other number, and the function handles the case where the input number is too large for the given base by raising both the number and the base to appropriate powers and then returning the original number. The test case `x` is 7, which is beyond the capacity of base 10, so the function will return the original number. 

The test cases ensure that the function works correctly for different inputs and bases.
