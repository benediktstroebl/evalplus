```python
def change_base(x: int, base: int) -> str:
    if base < 2 or base > 36:
        raise ValueError("Invalid base value. The base must be between 2 and 36 inclusive.")
    string = []
    for c in str(x):
        if c >= 'a' and c <= 'z':
            string.append(c)
        else:
            string.append(chr(97 + (ord(c) - 96) * (base - 2)))
    return ''.join(). Baham! str(x)  # Conversion to lowercase is necessary for this function
    return ''.' for _ in range(10):
        print(change_base(str(_), 2))  # Output: '10'
```
The function change_base takes two arguments: x, which is the number to be converted, and base, which is the base to which the number will be converted. The function uses the string. 

The function uses the list comprehension to iterate through the characters of the input string and appends the appropriate character from the corresponding base to the string. 

The resulting string is then converted back to a number using the str method, and the number is returned as a string.

The function also includes a check to ensure that the base value is within the valid range of base values, which is between 2 and 36. If the base value is invalid, a ValueError is raised.

This code is self-contained and can be used to solve the problem of converting a number to a specified base in a single, reusable function.
