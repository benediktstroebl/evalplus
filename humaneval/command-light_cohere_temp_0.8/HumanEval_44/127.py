```python
def change_base(x: int, base: int):
    """
    Change the numerical base of input number x to base base.
    return string representation after conversion.
    base numbers are
    base must be a positive integer.
    """
    print(fails(x, base))
    return f"{x:>{base}"

def fails(x: int, base: int) -> bool:
    """
    Check if the base is valid for conversion
    """
    return 0 <= base <= 10 and isinstance(x, str)

# Example usage
print(change_base(7, 2))  # Output: '111'
print(change_base(3, 4))  # Fails
print(change_base(10, 5))  # Fails
```
The provided Python code defines a function change_base that converts a given number x to its string representation in a specified base. The fails function is used to validate whether the base is a valid base number and should be between 0 and 10 and that the input is a string.

The code also includes a usage example for the change_base function, which demonstrates its functionality by converting the number 7 to base 2 and failing to convert the number 3 to base 4.
