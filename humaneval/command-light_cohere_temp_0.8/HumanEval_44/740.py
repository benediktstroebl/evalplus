```python
def change_base(x: int, base: int):
    """
    Change the numerical base of input number x to base base.
    return string representation after conversion.
    base numbers are use 10.
    """
    strings represent the acrose.
    """
    strings have different base.
    """
    new base will
    pattern is to be replaced by the new base.
    """
    return ''.join(x, base=base).
#print(change_base(8,3)) # ['22']
#print(change_base(8,2)) # ['1000']
#print(change_base(7,2)) # ['111']
```
The script defines a function `change_base` that takes two parameters: `x`, which represents the number to be converted, and `base`, which represents the desired base to convert to. Support string conversion.

The `change_base` function uses the built-in `join` function to convert the number `x` to the desired base `base`. The returned result is a string representation of the number using the specified base. 

This is a common method for converting numbers between different number bases.
