```  This script provides a self-contained function `change_base` that changes the numerical base of an input number `x` to a specified base. The function ensures that the base is valid, and raises a ValueError if it is not. It then converts the numbers to a string representation, using a loop while the number is greater than 0. The loop divides the numbers by the base until it becomes 0, and appends each digit to the result string with a space character. This method correctly changes the example numbers to base 3, and the results are as expected.
