```python
def change_base(x: int, base: int) -> str:
    """
    Change the numerical base of the input number x to base base.
    Return a string representation of the result.
    """
    input base is an integer in the desired base and x is a
    number in decimal system.
    """
    return format(fractions(x, base), 'I')
```
This function takes two parameters: `x`, which is the number to be converted, and `base`, which is the desired base to convert to. Zipped, the function creates a new number using the given base by calling `fractions()` function.  It number converts the
decimal representation of the input number to a string representation using the `format()` function, and returns the result.
