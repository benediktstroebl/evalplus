```python
def change_base(x: int, base: int) -> str:
    """
    Change the numerical base of the input number 'x' to the specified base.
    If specific base numbers, the base of 10 is used by default.
    """
    conversion is done using the int() + str() format, which converts a number to a string with base 10 representation.
    """
    resulting string is then converted back to an integer using int() to get the base 10 representation of the number.

return """ string representation after the conversion. 
```
This function accepts an integer 'x' and a base 'base' as input, and returns the corresponding string representation with the specified base.
