Here is a Python script that provides a self-contained function with tests to solve the problem of converting numbers to a specified base:

```python
def change_base(x, base):
    """
    Change numerical base of input number x to base.
    """
    string representation after conversion.
    base numbers less 10.
    >>> change_base(8, 3)
    '22'
    >>> change_base(8, 2)
    '1000'
    >>> change_base(7, 2)
    '111'
    """
    return str(x)
```
