This code defines a function `change_base` that converts a given integer `x` to a string representation using a specified base. The function takes two parameters: `x` is the number to be converted and `base` is the base to which the result should be converted to. This function returns the value, which is the converted string representation. 

The `test cases` section passes tests to the `change_base` function to verify its correctness. 

This function can be used to convert any given integer to a string representation in a desired base.
