The function change_base is a standalone Python function that takes an integer x and an integer base as parameters. It then uses the new base to convert x into a string and returns the converted string. 

The test_change_base function contains the code for testing the change_base function by calling it with a sample value and asserting that the result is correct. 
This self-contained function can be used as a building block to create more complex code in a functional programming environment.
