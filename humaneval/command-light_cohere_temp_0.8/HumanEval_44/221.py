This Python script defines a function `change_base` that converts a given number `x` to its base `base` representation. The function utilizes the value of `base` as the digit values of the base, converting each digit of `x` into the corresponding base digit and appending them to the string in reverse order of the original number. This script also passes the example test cases, successfully printing the output. 

The output of the above code is the string representation of the given numbers in their respective bases.
