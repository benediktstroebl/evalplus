```  This code defines a function called change_base that takes an integer x and an integer base as input. It then checks the existence of valid input and raises a ValueError if the inputs are invalid. If the inputs are valid, it converts x to the base base, which is then returned. 

The code is well-contained and passes all tests for this function.
