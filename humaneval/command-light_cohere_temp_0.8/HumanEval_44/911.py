```
This Python code defines a function change_base that takes two parameters: x, representing a number to be converted, and base, representing the desired base. The function then performs the string conversion of x to the specified base, ensuring that the input is valid (positive integer), and returns the converted result. The code then passes tests to the function, printing the results of the valid and invalid inputs, respectively. The test passes for positive integers but fails for negative integers and non-positive bases.
