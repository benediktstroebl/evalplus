This code defines a function `change_base` that takes two parameters: `x` and `base`. The function converts the numerical representation of `x` to the base `base`. It then returns the string representation of the number with the new base. The function uses a mathematical properties to calculate the result correctly and passes all the tests.

This code demonstrates the concept of changing the base of a number and provides a self-contained function to achieve this.
