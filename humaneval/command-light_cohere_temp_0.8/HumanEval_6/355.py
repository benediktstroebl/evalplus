Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function with a detailed explanation:
```python
from typing import List
def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    """
    A function that splits the input string by spaces into a list of parentheses levels, 
    and returns the deepest level of nesting.
    Args: 
        s (strring string containing nested parentheses)
    Returns: 
        List[int], each representing a level of a nested parentheses.
    """
    list comprehension to split the string into a list of characters, and then using the type inference to 
    create a function that returns the deepest level of nesting of parentheses. 
```
This function takes a string as input and splits it into a list of characters. It then uses a list comprehension to split the string into a list of characters, and then uses the type inference to create a function that returns the deepest level of nesting of parentheses.
