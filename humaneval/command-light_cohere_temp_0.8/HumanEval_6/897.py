This script defines a function `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string as input and returns a list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the string. The function uses a `stack` to keep track of the deepest level of parentheses encountered so far, and uses this stack to reconstruct the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses.
