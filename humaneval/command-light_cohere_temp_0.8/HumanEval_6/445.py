This function, parse_nested_parens, takes an input string s representing multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. It creates a stack to store opening parentheses and the current level of nesting. It then iterates through the process until it finds a closing parenthesis. If there are not enough opening parentheses found, an error message is printed. If the stack is empty after processing, it means there are not enough closing parentheses, and the function returns an empty list. Otherwise, it pops the opened parentheses, and appends the current nesting level (1 for the last opened parenthesis) to the stack. The function then appends a closing parenthesis and returns the stack.

This code is a self-contained function that solves the problem of parsing nested parentheses and passes the tests.
