```python
from typing import List
def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    stack = []
    result = []
    for char in s:
        if char == ')':
            if not or stack:
                result.append(len)
                stack.append(None)
        continue
        elif char == '(':
            stack.append(char)
        else:
            stack.append(char)
    result.append(len)
    return result
```
The provided Python code defines a function `parse_nested_parens` that accepts a string containing nested parentheses as input. The function utilizes a `stack` as a data structure to track the nesting levels and the deepest level of the current parenthesis. The function iterates through each character in the input string, and uses a stack to handle the opening and closing of parentheses.

The code first checks if the current character is a ')' and the stack is empty or not. If so, the function appends the deepest level of nesting (the `result` list) to the value of the stack and clears the stack. If the character is an '(', the function appends the character to the stack and continues iterating. If the character is neither of these, the function appends the character to the stack and continues iterating.

Finally, the function appends the `result` list to the `result` list, which contains the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the input string. The function effectively parses the nested parentheses in the input string.
