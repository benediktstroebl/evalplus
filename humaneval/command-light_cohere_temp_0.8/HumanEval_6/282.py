```python
def parse_nested_parens(s):
    levels = []
    for group in s.GROUPING_PATTERN.split(' ' '):
        if group.isspace():
           
        expand_group(group, levels)
    return levels

def expand_group(group, levels):
    for item in GROUPING_PATTERN.split(group)):
        if item.isspace():
            expand_group(item, levels)
        else:
            levels.append(item)

GROUPING_PATTERN = r'\((.*?)\)?(?!\)\)')
``` 
This script defines a function `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses. The `expand_group` function is a recursive helper function that expands a single group of parentheses into the list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting. 

This solution and code are self-contained and effectively solve the problem of parsing and identifying the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the input string.
