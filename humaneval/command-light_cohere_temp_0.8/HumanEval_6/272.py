```python
def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    stack = []
    out = []
    for c in s:
        if c == "(":  # Start of group
            stack.append(1)
        out.append(stack.pop())
    ++
    nested = parse_nested_parens(s[stack:])
        stack.append(0)  # Start of next group
        out.append(nested)
    return out
```

The code defines a function parse_nested_parens that takes a string s as input and returns a list of integers. The function uses a stack to keep track of open parentheses and a counter out to keep track of the deepest level of nesting. The function then iterates through the characters in the string, and if it encounters a left parenthesis "("), it adds the open parenthesis to the stack and starts a new group by popping the current element. The function then iterates through the nested parentheses in the string and adds each nested group to the out list.
