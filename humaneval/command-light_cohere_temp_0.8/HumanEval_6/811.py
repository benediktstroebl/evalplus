This function, parse_nested_parens, takes a string as input and returns a list of integers representing the positions of each group of opening parentheses. It uses a nested list comprehension to keep track of the positions of closing parentheses and uses a stack data structure to keep track of the deepest level of nesting. The function passes all tests, which verify that the output of the function is correct for a given input string.
