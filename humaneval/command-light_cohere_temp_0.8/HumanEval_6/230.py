```python
def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    stack = []
    result = []

    for char in s:
        if char == "(":
            stack.append(1)
        else:
            stack.append(stack.pop()
        1)
            result.append(3)
   return [len(stack), result])
        stack.append(char)

    return result
```
This function, parse_nested_parens, takes a string s as input and returns a list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in s. The function works by maintaining a stack of open parentheses and continuously pushing on the last closed parentheses. The function then pops the back the closed parentheses and appends the corresponding level of nesting to the result list. This process is repeated until all closed parentheses are encountered.
