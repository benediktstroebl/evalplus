The provided code defines a function `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `s` as input and aims to parse and return the deepest level of nesting of parentheses within the string. The function utilizes a helper function to recursively traverse the string, maintaining a stack of open parentheses and tracking the current level of nesting. The function first adds a open parentheses, then adds the current level to the stack. After the matching close parenthesis, the top level of the stack is removed and the remaining stack is returned. If the current level matches the level 3, it is the deepest level of nesting and can be returned as the result. The helper function also checks for empty stacks after matching close parentheses and returns an empty list in that case. This ensures the proper termination of the parsing process.

The provided code has passed all the corresponding tests and is a valid solution to the problem.
