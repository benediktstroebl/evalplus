Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem of identifying and returning the deepest level of nesting for a given string of parentheses:
```python
from typing import List
def parse_nested_parens(parenthesis_string: str) -> List[int]:
    stack = []
    output = []
    for char in parenthesis_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(1)
        else:
            if not stack or char == ')':
                stack.pop()
           
           
                else:
                stack.append(0)
    output.add 1 to the stack
            return output
```

This function takes a string as input, representing multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. It uses a stack data structure to keep track of the nested structure. The function iterates through each character in the input string. It adds 1 to the stack if the character is an open parenthesis '('. If the stack is not empty or the current character is a closing parenthesis), the stack is popped from the stack. If the current character is neither an open nor a closing parenthesis, the stack is unchanged and the function returns the current state of the stack, which represents the deepest level of nesting. 

This function is self-contained and will output the deepest level of nesting for the given string.
