This code defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string of nested parentheses as input and returns a list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the string. The function uses a stack to keep track of the opening levels of each group of parentheses and uses a sliding window to keep track of the deepest level of nesting for each group. 

The function starts by initializing variables for the stack, opening level, start_pos, and list of groups to be returned. It then iterates through each character in the input string, checking if it is an opening parenthesis `(). If it is, the opening level is incremented. If it is a closing parenthesis `)`, the function checks if an opening level is greater than 0. If it is, the closing level is decremented, and the opening level is saved in the stack. If the character is not a closing parenthesis, the function appends the character to the stack and resets the stack to keep track of the deepest level of nesting for the current group of parentheses.
