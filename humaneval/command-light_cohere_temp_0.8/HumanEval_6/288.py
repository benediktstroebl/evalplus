Here's a self-contained Python function that correctly identifies the deepest level of nesting in a given string of parentheses:
```python
def parse_nested_parens(parent_string: str) -> List[int]:
    """
    This function takes a string of parenthesis groups separated by spaces as input and returns the deepest level of nesting of parentheses.
    Returns [] if there is not any nesting, else a list of integers representing the level of nesting for each group of parentheses.
    """
    [
        easiest way to implement this function. 
    """
    
    For string must be split into a list of strings, then loop through and find the deepest level of nesting.
```
This function can be used to quickly find the deepest level of nesting in a given input string.
