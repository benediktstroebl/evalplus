The provided Python function `parse_nested_parens` takes a string of parentheses as input and returns a list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses. It uses a common opening and closing brackets for parentheses and a stack data structure to keep track of opening brackets encountered. The function iterates through the opening brackets, pops the topmost brackets from the stack, and appends them to a list of groups to be returned. This process continues until all stack is empty, effectively capturing all nested parentheses in the input string.
