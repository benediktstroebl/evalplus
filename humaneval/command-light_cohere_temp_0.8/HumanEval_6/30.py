The provided Python function, `parse_nested_parens`, is designed to parse and identify the deepest level of nesting within a given string of parentheses. It accomplishes this task by maintaining a stack of integer indices and tracking the opening and closing of parentheses using a boolean variable `paren_open`. 

The function iterates through each character in the input string, performing the following operations:
- When an open parenthesis ('(') is encountered, its index is added to the stack.
- When a close parenthesis (')') is encountered, the function checks if it's not currently opening a parenthesis. If not, it pops the index from the stack and resets the `parens_open` variable to False, effectively closing the current parenthesis.
- If cases, the function maintains the indices of open parentheses in the stack and appends them to it.

This function effectively solves the problem of parsing nested parentheses by finding the deepest level of nesting within the given input string.
