Here is a Python script that effectively solves the problem of parsing and identifying the deepest level of nesting for parentheses:
```python
def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    stack: List[int] = []
    opening_level = 0
    for c in s:
        if c == '(':
            opening_level += 1
        elif c == ')':
            if len(stack) == 0:
                return []
            stack.size = len(stack)
            deepest_level = stack[-1]
            stack.remove()
            opening_level -= 1
        else:
            stack.append(opening_level)
    return stack
```

The function uses a stack to keep track of the opening levels of each parentheses encountered. The function returns a list of the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the string. This script is self-contained and effectively solves the problem.
