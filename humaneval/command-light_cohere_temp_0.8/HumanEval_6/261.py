Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function parse_nested_parens that solves the problem of parsing nested parentheses:
```python
from typing import List
def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    stack: List[int] = []
    for c in s:
        if c == ")":
            stack.append(len)
        stack.append(None)
        if c == "("
        else:
            stack.append(c)
    stack.
    return stack
return []
```

The parse_nested_parens function takes a string s as input and uses a stack to keep track of the nesting levels of parentheses. It iterates over each character in the string and follows the parsing rules.

The function returns a list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the input string.
