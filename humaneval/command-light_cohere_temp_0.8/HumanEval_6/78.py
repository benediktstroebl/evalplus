Here's a self-contained Python function that parses and handles the given markdown code block:
```python
from typing import List


def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    """
    This function is designed to parse and return the deepest level of nesting for a string of nested parentheses.

    Here's an example that illustrates the usage of this function:
    Input: ((()))
    Output: [2]
    """
    stack: List[int] = []
    for i in range(0, len(s) // 2):  # since the input string is always double-lined
        p = s[i:i+2]  # get the group of parentheses
        stack.append(1)  # assuming only one level of nesting is possible in this test case
        if p == '()':
            stack.append(0)  # else, append the group
        if len(stack) == 0:
            return []  # if no nested parentheses found, it's the deepest level.

    groups: List[int] = []
    for j in range(0, len(stack)):
        groups.append(stack[j][1])  # get the group and remove from the stack
        stack.pop(j)

    return groups  # return the list of deepest levels of nesting
```

This function takes a string as input and uses a stack to keep track of the nested parentheses. It iterates through the the input string line by line, assuming that the input is always double-lined. The function then checks the first character of the group to see if it's a '(' character, in which case it's a level-1 group. If it is a ')', it pushes the group onto the stack and keeps going. If it's the character, it assumes that there can only be one level of nesting, so it appends the group to a new list of deepest levels of nesting and returns that list.
