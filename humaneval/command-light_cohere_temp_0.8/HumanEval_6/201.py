```python
from typing import List
def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    stack = []
    result = []
    for group in s:
        if group == '(':
            stack.append(1)
        else:
            if len(stack) == 0:
                result.append(0)
            else:
                result.append(stack.pop().note the biggest value with the nested structure, which is to solve the problem.

``` 
The function `parse_nested_parens` takes a string `s` as input, which is a series of parentheses. The string is parsed into a list of integer levels of nesting. 

The function uses a stack to keep track of the opening parentheses, and the result is a list of integer levels of nesting for each group of parentheses in the string.
