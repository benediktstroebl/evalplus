The function `parse_nested_parens` takes a string `s` that contains multiple groups of parentheses separated by spaces. 

The function uses a stack to keep track of the open parentheses and levels of nesting. It uses two dictionaries to keep track of the closing parentheses and their levels. The function iterates over each character in the string, and uses the appropriate dictionary to update the appropriate values accordingly. 

The function returns a list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the string.
