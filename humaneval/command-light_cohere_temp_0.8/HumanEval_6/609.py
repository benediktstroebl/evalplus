This Python function, parse_nested_parens, takes a string as input and returns a list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the string. It uses a nested list, stack, to keep track of opening parentheses and their levels. The function iterates through each character in the input string, and uses a series of if-elif statements to determine the type of character and the appropriate action to take based on the character.
