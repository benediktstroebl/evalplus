The provided Python code defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that efficiently analyzes and computes the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in a given string. The function utilizes a `List` data structure for efficient tracking of opening and closing levels of each group. It iterates through `stack` to keep track of the current parenthesis depth, `opening_levels` to track the opening parenthesis levels, and `closing_levels` to track the closing parenthesis levels. The function then iterates over each character in the input string, and whenever a parenthesis ('(') is encountered, it is added to the stack, and the corresponding levels in `opening_levels` and `closing_levels` are updated accordingly. When a parenthesis is consumed (closing parenthesis ')' is encountered), the corresponding levels in the stack and `closing_levels` are popped, and if there are no more parenthesis left in the stack, the function returns the `opening_levels` which represent the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses.
