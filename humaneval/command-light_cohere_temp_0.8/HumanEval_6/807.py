``` 
This function takes a string as its input and returns a list of integer indices representing the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses found in the string. The function uses a stack data structure to keep track of the open parentheses and their indices. It uses a method to iterate over each character in the string. When it encounters an open parenthesis '(', it adds the current index to the stack. When it encounters a closing parenthesis ')', it checks if there is a non-zero index in the stack. If there is, it pops the last element from the stack and sets the count to 0, indicating that the closing parenthesis has been matched. If there are any remaining elements in the stack after processing, it raises a 'ValueError' to indicate an unmatched closing parenthesis.
