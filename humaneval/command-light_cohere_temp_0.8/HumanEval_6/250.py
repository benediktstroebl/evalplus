```
This function takes a string s as input and returns a list of depths of nesting for each group of parentheses in the string. The function uses a nested while loop to iterate through the string, and for each opening parent ('), the depth is increased by 1. For each closing parent ('), the depth is decremented by 1. If the last element is not an opening parent, the character is appended to the current group. The function returns the list containing the depths of nesting for each group of parentheses in the input string.
