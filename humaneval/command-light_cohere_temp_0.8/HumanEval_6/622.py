This script defines a function that takes a string of nested parentheses as input and returns a list of the deepest nesting levels of parentheses in the string. It uses a stack data structure to keep track of the open parentheses and their nesting levels, and it processes the input string by iterating through the matches to find the deepest levels of nesting.

The function also has tests to ensure the correct functionality of the function, such as checking if the stack is empty before popping a pair and making sure the output is a list of integers.

This function is a self-contained and can be used to solve the problem of finding the deepest levels of nesting in a string of parentheses.
