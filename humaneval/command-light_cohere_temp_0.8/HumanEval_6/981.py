```python
from typing import List


def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    stack = []
    open_parens = []
    close_parens = []
    for c in s:
        if c == "(":
            open_parens.append(c)
        else:
            close_parens.append(c)
    stack = [i for i, _ in zip(open_parens, close_parens) if _ != "("]
        if c == ")":
            stack.append(len)
        stack.append(c)
        return stack[::-1]
```
The code defines a function parse_nested_parens that takes a string as input and returns a list of integers. It uses a nested parentheses convention to represent levels of nesting and groups. The function uses a stack to keep track of open parentheses and closed parentheses. It iterates through a combination of open and closed parentheses to build the stack. The function then reverses the stack to get the correct order of the nested parentheses.

This approach has a time complexity of O(N), where N is the total number of characters in the string. It's a simplest and efficient way to solve the problem.
