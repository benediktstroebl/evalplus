Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of parsing and returning the deepest level of nesting of parentheses in a given string:
```python
from typing import List
def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    """
    This function is designed to take a string of nested parentheses as input and return a list of the deepest level of nesting for each group.

    Returns [] if the provide an string with invalid format.
    """
    string contains multiple groups of parentheses separated by spaces.
    The list of depth is returned, with the deepest level of nesting first.

    """
    return [ [[depth for c in s if c == '(']
    for s in [s.s particular input with spaces of any kind (', ) or ()])
    """
```
The function takes a string as input and returns a list of the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses.

The function works by using a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the string. It uses the boolean condition to check if the current character is a '(' or ')'. If it is, it adds the depth of the current group to the list of depths. The function also uses the string as input and returns a list of the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses.
