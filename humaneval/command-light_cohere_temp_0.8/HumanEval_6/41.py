```python
from typing import List
def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    stack = []
    for c in s:
        if c == '(': stack.append(0)
        elif c == ')':
            if stack: stack.pop()
               if a filled:
                lvl = stack.pop()
               max = len(stack) - 1
                stack.append(lvl)
        else: stack.push(0)
    return stack
```
This Python code defines a function `parse_nested_parens` that performs a nested parentheses parsing task. The function takes a input string `s` representing multiple groups of parentheses separated by spaces. It utilizes a list comprehension to iterate over each character `c` in the string, checking if it's an opening parenthesis `(). If it is, the function adds a zero to a stack `stack` to keep track of the nesting level. 

After processing all characters, the function examines the stack. If it's empty, indicating that there are no closing parentheses to match against opening parentheses, the function returns the `stack` as the deepest level of nesting of parentheses. If there are closing parentheses, the function pops the topmost element from the stack, converts it to a level, and appends it to the stack. This process continues until the depth is reached and returns the final stack, which contains the deepest level of nesting of parentheses in the input string.
