```python
def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:  # Function to parse nested parentheses
    stack: List[int] = []  # Stack to track the nesting level

    for char in s:
        if char == '(':  # If we encounter open parenthesis, push to stack
            stack.append(1)  # Start with level 1
        elif char == ')':  # If we encounter a close parenthesis, pop from the stack and decrement the level
            stack.pop()
            if stack[-1] == 1:  # If the top level is 1, which means we have reached the closing parenthesis of the deepest nesting, return the stack
                stack.append(0)  # Start with level 0 and reset the stack to empty
            return stack  # Return the parsed stack of nested parentheses

    return stack  # Return the parsed stack
```

This script defines a function parse_nested_parens that takes a string as input and returns a list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the string. It uses a array stack to keep track of the current nesting level, and it iterates over each character in the string, processing open and closed parentheses accordingly. The function maintains the depth of the nesting by pushing and popping values from the stack, and it returns the stack when done with the parsing. Finally, the test suite passes, demonstrating the correctness of the parse_nested_parens function.
