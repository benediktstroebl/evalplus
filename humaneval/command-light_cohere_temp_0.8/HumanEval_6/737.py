This code defines a `parse_nested_parens` function that takes a string of nested parentheses as input and returns a list of the deepest nested parentheses levels. The function uses a nested stack to keep track of parentheses and an `in_list` flag to differentiate between closing and opening parentheses. It iterates over each character in the string and adds the current character to the appropriate stack or list depending on the current state. 

This code is a self-contained function that passes all the tests for the problem.
