This script defines a function `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string as input and returns a list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the string. The function uses a stack to keep track of the current level of opening parentheses and uses it to maintain the state of nesting. It also uses an out stack to hold the parsed output and uses it to store the last level of each group of parentheses. The function iterates through the string, starting from the current index and moving forward. It checks for the`" opening parenthesis (if it is not empty) or closing parenthesis. If it encounters an opening parenthesis, it adds the current index to the stack. If it encounters a` closing parenthesis, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is empty, this level is the last level, and the current index is added to the output. Otherwise, it removes the index from the stack and adds it to the output. The function then continues until it reaches the end of the string. This function successfully parses the` nested parentheses in the string and returns the list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses.
