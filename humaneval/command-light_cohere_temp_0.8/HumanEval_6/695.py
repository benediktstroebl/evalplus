Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of parsing and returning the deepest level of nesting for given parentheses:
```python
def parse_nested_parens(s):
    """
    Input to this function is a string represented multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.
    Returns a
    list of deepest level of nesting.
    """
    previous solution"""
    [i,j,k]
    for i, group in enumerate(s):
        if group == '()':
            s[i] = None  # Nested, remove the current parent from the string
            break  # Exit the loop if we found a parent
        else:
            if s[i] is not None:  # Ensure we only have one level of nesting
                parse_nested_parens(s)  # Recursively find the deepest level
    return [i for i, group in enumerate(s) if group is not None]
```
This function takes a string `s` as input, representing multiple groups of parentheses separated by spaces. It returns a outcome, which is a list of the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in `s`. 

The function uses a nested loop to iterate over each group of parentheses in `s`. It checks if the current group is ')' and sets the current group to None. If the current group is not ')' or it has a previous group, it assumes it has only one level of nesting and calls the function recursively to find the deepest level.
