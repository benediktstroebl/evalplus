This function uses a stack to keep track of opening parentheses and a list to keep track of the deepest level of nesting. The function loops through the string, and for each character, it checks if it is an opening parenthesis or a closing parenthesis. If it is an opening parenthesis, it pushes the current level of nesting onto the stack. If it is a closing parenthesis, it checks if the current level of nesting is the deepest level of nesting, and if so, it appends a 0 to the list of the deepest level of nesting. If it is a opening parenthesis, it pushes the current level of nesting back onto the stack. If it is a closing parenthesis, it pops the current level of nesting off the stack, and appends the next character to the list of the deepest level of nesting. If it is not an closing parenthesis or a character other than an opening or closing parenthesis, it appends the next character to the list of the deepest level of nesting.
