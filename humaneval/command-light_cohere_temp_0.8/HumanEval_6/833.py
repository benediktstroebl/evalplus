Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem of finding the deepest level of nesting for any given input string:
```python
def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    stack = []
    opening = True
    result = []
    for c in s:
        if opening and c == "(":
            stack.append(1)
        opening = False
        elif closing and c == ")":
            stack.pop()
            opening = True
        elif c.isspace():
           
            result.append(stack.pop() if closing is
            if stack:
                return result
            stack = []
    return result
``` 
The provided code defines a function `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a list of integers containing the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses found in `s`. 

The function utilizes a stack data structure to keep track of open parentheses and their corresponding levels. It iterates through string character to determine if each character is an opening or closing parenthesis. When an opening parenthesis is encountered, it's added to the stack. Once a closing parenthesis is encountered, it's popped from the stack and the opening flag is reset. 

The function then iterates through the string character by character, appending the deepest level of nesting found on the stack to the result list. If no nesting is found on the stack after the loop completes, it means that there are no more nested parentheses in the string, and the function returns the result list containing the level of the deepest nesting found.
