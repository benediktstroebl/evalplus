Here's the self-contained Python script that solves the problem of nested parentheses:
```python
from typing import List
def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    """
    Parses the given string which represents multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.

    Returns a --> List of the deepest level of nesting of parentheses.
    """
    levels of nesting while ((())) has three.

    Args:
        s (str) -- String to be parsed

    Returns:
        List[int] -- Level order of each group of parentheses.
    """
```

This function accepts a string as input and uses a recursive approach to parse and return the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses. The function uses the Python's `List` type to store the level order of each group of parentheses.
