```
This Python code defines a function called **parse_nested_parens** that is designed to parse and return the deepest level of nesting of parentheses in a given string. 

The function uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening parentheses encountered. It starts with an flag "in_string" to indicate if the current character is the beginning of a new string or inside an existing one. 

When an '(' character is encountered while the flag is set, it means we are inside a string and need to push the current output onto the stack. When the ')' character is encountered, it means we are outside the string and need to pop the last element from the stack and append it to the output list. 

This approach ensures that each level of nesting is correctly captured, and it efficiently handles any level of nesting.
