```python
def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    """
    Function to parse and return the deepest level of nesting for parentheses in a string.
    Parameters:
    - string to be parsed is passed in as s (required to be a string)
    Returns:
    List of the deepest level of nesting for parentheses.

    return [ [map(lambda x: x == '(', len(x), s)])
    ``` 
This code defines a function parse_nested_parens that takes a string s as input and returns a list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting for parentheses in the string. The function uses a lambda function and the map function to iterate over each character in the string and returns the deepest level of nesting for each character that is a '(' or ')' character.
