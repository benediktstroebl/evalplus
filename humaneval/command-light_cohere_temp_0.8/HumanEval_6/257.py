Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function that solves the problem of parsing nested parentheses:
```python
from typing import List
def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    """
    Parses a string representing multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces.
    Returns a particular nesting level with the highest level of nesting.
    """

Example usage:
    >>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
    [2, 3, 1, 3]
    """
    stack: List[int] = []
    open_brack: int = 0
    close_brack: int = 0
    level: int = 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '(' and open_brack == 0:
            open_brack += 1
            stack.append(level)
        level += 1
        elif char == ')' and open_brack != 0:
            open_brack -= 1
            stack.append(level)
        level -= 1
        elif char == ')' and open_brack != 0:
            open_brack = 0
            level = stack.pop()
        maximum_level of nesting in the string.

def test_parse_nested_parens():
    """
    Parses and tests a string that contains multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces.
    """
    Input is a string representing multiple groups of nested parentheses.
    """
    expected_output: a list of integers representing the nesting levels.
    """
