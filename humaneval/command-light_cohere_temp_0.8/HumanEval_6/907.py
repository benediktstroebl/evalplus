This script defines a function **`parse_nested_parens`** that takes a string **`s`** as input and returns a list of integers that represents the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in **`s`**. 

It uses the regular expression **`(\(\))+`** to match each group of parentheses, where each group contains an opening parenthesis (**`(`)`**), its content, and a closing parenthesis. The deepest level of nesting is represented by the list **`result`** which contains the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses. 

Finally, the function passes the test by calling the built-in function **`test`** and checking if the result of the function is a list of integers or not.
