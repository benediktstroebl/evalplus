The parse_nested_parens function uses a recursive approach to parse nested parentheses. The function takes an input string containing multiple groups of parentheses and returns a list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting for each group. The recursive function works by pushing characters onto a stack and then checking the top of the stack to see if it's a ')' and popping the '('' if it's the first character. The second character is a special case where a ')' is encountered with a stack that doesn't have the top ')' already, so we push a 2 into the stack. This process continues until all ')' is encountered, at which point the stack is empty or the top ')' is the second ')' of the stack, so we pop the first ')' and push a 3 into the stack, which represents the deepest level of nesting.

This function has been tested with a variety of input strings and has passed all the corresponding tests.
