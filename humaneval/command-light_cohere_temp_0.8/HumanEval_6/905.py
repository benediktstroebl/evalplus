Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of parsing and identifying nested parentheses:
```python
def parse_nested_parens(parentheses_string: str) -> List[int]:
    """
    This function is designed to parse and identify the deepest level of nesting for parentheses in a given string.
    Input to this function is a string represented multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.
    The deepest level of nesting for each group is returned as a list.
    Returns: list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting.
    """
    test usage:
    assert parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((()))()')
    == [2, 3, 1, 3]
    """
    return [level for level in range(4)]  # referring to the innermost level
```
Do you find this script helpful?
