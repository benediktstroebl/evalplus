```python
def parse_nested_parens(parenthes):
    stack = []
    result = []
    for token in parenthes:
        if token == '(':
            stack.append(1)
        else:
            if len(stack) == 0:
                result.append(3)
                stack.append(0)
            else:
                stack.pop()
       first level = stack[-1]
                result.append(3)
                stack.append(1)
    return result
```

The code you provided defines a function parse_nested_parens that takes a string of nested parentheses as input and returns a list of the deepest levels of nesting for each group of parentheses. The code uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening and closing parentheses. The deepest level of nesting for each group is calculated by tracing back through the stack, starting from the last closing parenthesis.
