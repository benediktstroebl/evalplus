This Python function, parse_nested_parens, takes a string as input and returns a list of integer values representing the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the string. The function uses a following logic:
1. First, it initializes an stack variable to keep track of the last parsed character.
2. Then, it iterates through through each character in the input string, and it checks if the character is an open parenthesis ('('). If it is, the nested level is incremented.
3. Next, it checks if the character is a close parenthesis (')'. If it is, the nested level is decremented.
4. If the character is neither an open nor close parenthesis, it checks if the nested level is zero. Then, if the character is not an open parenthesis, it is added to the stack.
5. If the nested level is greater than zero, it means that there are no more nested parentheses left, so the character is added to the stack and the function returns the stack content.
6. Finally, if the character is a close parenthesis, it means that the parsing is finished. The function then returns the content of the stack, which represents the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the string.

This function is self-contained and can be used to solve the problem of parsing nested parentheses in a given string. It provides a tests by passing different test cases, which demonstrate its correctness.
