Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of parsing and identifying the deepest level of nesting in a string of parentheses:
```python
from typing import List
def parse_nested_parens(s: str) -> List[int]:
    stack: List[int] = []
    for c in s:
        if c == '(':
            stack.append(1)
        elif c == ')':
            if not stack or stack[-1] == 1:
                stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append(0)
        elif c == '(':
                stack.append(3)
        else:
                stack.append(2)
    return stack
```

This function uses a stack to keep track of the nested structure of the input string. It iterates through string and for each character, it takes the appropriate action based on the character. The function returns the list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting in the input string.
