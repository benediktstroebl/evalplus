This Python function `parse_nested_parens` is designed to parse and return a list of integer levels of nesting for each group of parentheses in a string. The function uses a following approach to parse the given string:
1. It initializes an stack, an in_string flag, and an `opening_parenthesis` flag.
2 It iterates through each character in the string, the function checks the character and its current state.
3. If the character is a space, and the current state is not `in_string`, it appends the opening `opening_parenthesis` to the stack.
4. If the character is a space and the current state is not `opening_parenthesis`, it sets the `in_string` flag to `True` and sets the `opening_parenthesis` flag to `True`.
5. If the character is an open parenthesis and the current state is not `in_string`, it appends the current integer level of nesting to the stack.
6. If the character is a space and the current state is `opening_parenthesis`, it sets the `in_string` flag to `True` and sets the `opening_parenthesis` flag to `False`.
7. If the character is an closing parenthesis, it sets the `in_string` flag to `True` and sets the `opening_parenthesis` flag to `False`.
8. If the character is not a space nor an open or closing parenthesis, it sets the `in_string` flag to `True` and sets the `opening_parenthesis` flag to `False`.
9. The function returns the list of integers representing the integer levels of nesting for each group of parentheses in the string.

Note that this function uses a stack to keep track of nesting levels. The function also uses the `in_string` and `opening_parenthesis` flags to differentiate between the string and the current opening or closing parenthesis.
