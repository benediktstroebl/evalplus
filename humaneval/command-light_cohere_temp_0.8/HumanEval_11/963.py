Here's the solution:

```python
from typing import List

def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ XOR two strings containing only 1s and 0s.
    return ''.join(a, b)

# Test case:
# a = '010'
# b = '110'
# result = string_xor(a, b)
# print(result) # Output should be '100'
```

I hope this self-contained solution addresses the problem of performing XOR on strings consisting of only 1s and 0s and passes all the tests successfully.
