```python
from typing import List

def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ 
    Perform binary XOR on input strings and return result as a string.
    """ 
    return a string.xor(a +b)
``` 
This function takes two strings as input and returns the XOR of those two strings. It uses the string concatenation and the `str.st string` method to combine the two input strings into a single string. 

You can use this function to solve the problem of performing XOR on two given strings in a markdown code block.
