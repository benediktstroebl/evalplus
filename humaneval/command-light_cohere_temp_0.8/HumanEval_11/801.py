``` 
The code defines a Python function `string_xor` that performs the XOR operation on two input strings, consisting only of 1s and 0s. 

It uses Python's `typing` module to define the function signature and return type. 

The function takes two arguments: `str(a)` converts the input string `a` into a list of ints, and then performs the XOR operation on the list of ints and the reversed list of ints. 

Finally, it converts the result back to a string and returns it. 

The code also includes a test suite with several test cases to verify the correctness of the `string_xor` function. 

The test suite uses the `assert` statement to check if the output of the `string_xor` function matches the expected result.
