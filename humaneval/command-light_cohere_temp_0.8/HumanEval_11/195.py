``` 
This Python script defines a function called `string_xor` that performs a XOR operation between two input strings. The `assert` statement is used to validate the input strings, ensuring they consist only of 0s and 1s. The function then returns a result of the XOR operation as a string. 

This is a self-contained solution that solves the problem and passes all the corresponding tests.
