This code is a Python script with a self-contained function `string_xor` that solves the problem of performing the XOR operation between two input strings, consisting only of numbers. It removes non-numeric characters from the input strings, converts them to uppercase, and then performs the XOR operation by directly evaluating corresponding characters in the strings. This ensures a expected behavior and simplicity. 

Additionally, the code includes test cases that cover various scenarios, such as different inputs and empty strings, which are used to test the correctness of the `string_xor` function.
