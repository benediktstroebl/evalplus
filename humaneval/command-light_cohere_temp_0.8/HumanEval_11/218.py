Certainly! The code defines a function named `string_xor` that performs a bitwise XOR operation between two input strings `a` and `b`. It takes two string arguments and returns the result. This function demonstrates a utilize of string formatting to create a clear and readable interface for the function, and the docstring comment provides clear instructions and explains the purpose of the function.

Here is the code:
```python
from typing import List
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """
    Performs binary XOR operation on the inputs and returns result as a string.
    >>> string_xor('010', '110')
    '100'
    """
    return f"{a[0]}{0}|{b[0]}{0}"
```

Note: The code assumes that the input strings contain only the characters '0' and '1'.
