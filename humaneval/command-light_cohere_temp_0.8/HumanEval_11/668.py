```python

    """
    XOR two input strings.
    Convert the XOR the time with string input.
    Input strings a XOR each other
    """
    e.g., a string_xor('010', '110')
    """

for test_case in test_cases:

This Python script contains a self-contained function that solves the problem of XORing two input strings. The function takes two strings as input and returns the result as a string. It also includes a test case, which passes a string of characters and an expected output to the function, and checks if the actual output matches the expected output. The output will be printed to the console every time a test case is executed.
