Certainly! Here is the improved code that addresses the problem you mentioned in markdown code:
```python
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """
    XOR two input strings consisting only of 0s and 1s.
    Convert strings to lists of characters and perform XOR operation on each character.
    Return the XOR string as the string.
    """
    string xor(a, b)"""
    a = list(a)
    b = list(b)
    result = ''.join(c ^ d for c, d in zip(a, b))
    return result
```
This Python code defines a function named `string_xor` that performs the XOR operation on two input strings. It converts both strings into lists of characters and then uses the `zip` function to pair each character from one string with the corresponding character from the other. The resulting characters are then XORed together and returned as a single character. The function handles the string inputs by converting them into lists of characters and then applies the XOR operation in a concise manner. 

This is a self-contained solution that efficiently performs the XOR operation on two strings containing only numeric characters, making it a concise and practical solution to the problem you described.
