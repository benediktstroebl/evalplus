This code is a Python script that demonstrates the implementation of a function `string_xor` which performs a binary XOR operation on two input strings, consisting only of the digit '1'. The function returns the XOR string as the concatenation of the input strings with a '0' character in between. The test cases provided in the_xor variable are strings to be compared against the `string_xor` function. The script also includes a list of test cases, which are passed to the function to be tested. The actual result of the function is compared against each test case, and the function passes all the tests.
