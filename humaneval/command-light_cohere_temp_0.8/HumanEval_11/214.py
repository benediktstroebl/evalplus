Here's a self-contained Python function that performs the string XOR operation for two input strings consisting only of single characters:
```python
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """
    XOR two input strings a and b consisting only of single characters.
    Returns the single character of single characters.
    Returns the dry string containing the result of XOR.
    """
   string_xor('010', '110')
    # '100"
```
Do you need assistance with anything else related to Python scripting or code readability?
