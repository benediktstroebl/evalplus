    """
    XOR two strings a and b consisting only of 1s and 0s.
    Returns the string a same characters, regardless of case.

```

This script provides a function `string_xor` that takes two strings containing only digits from 0 to 9 as input and returns their XOR. The function is tested by passing the test function, and the test passes successfully, demonstrating the correctness of the `string_xor` function.
