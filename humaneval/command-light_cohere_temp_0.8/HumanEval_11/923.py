Certainly! Here's the Python code for the string xor problem, which accepts two strings and returns the XORed string:

```python
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """Function to perform XOR on two input strings."""
    return a ^ b
```

The code defines a function 'string_xor' that takes two strings as arguments and returns their XOR as a new string. It uses the straightforward implementation by performing the XOR operation on the two input strings using the '^' operator.

Please note that this solution is self-contained and can be run independently. It can be easily imported and called as a module in another script.
