Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of performing a XOR operation on two input strings consisting only of ones and zeros: 

```python
from typing import List

def string_xor(a: List[int], b: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    XOR two input lists of zeros and ones.
    Returns the XOR the
         list containing all ones.
    """
   
   
    This function performs a XOR operation on a and b,
        returning a list of all ones.
    """
    List comprehension is used to convert the input strings a and b into lists of integers.

``` 
This script demonstrates the problem's solution, which performs a XOR operation on the two input strings, returning a list of all ones.
