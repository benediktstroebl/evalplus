```
The function 'string_xor' accepts two strings and performs an XOR operation on them. The function converts the strings to lowercase to ensure consistency, counts the characters, and returns the XOR of the character counts. The test suite, which passes several test cases, ensures that the 'string_xor' function works correctly.
