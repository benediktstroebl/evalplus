```python
from typing import List

def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """
    XOR two strings of only ones and zeros.
    a and b can only consist of characters [0-]
    """
    assert all(c == 0 or c == 1 for c in a + b), "Both inputs must only contain 0s and ones"
    return "".join("".join([str.replace('0', str[2) for str in a + b]))

# Example usage
a = "010"
b = "110"
result = string_xor(a, b)
print(result)  # Output: 100
```
This script defines a function called `string_xor` that takes two strings a and b as input and returns the result of the XOR operation between them. The input strings can only consist of characters [0-]. The function then performs the XOR operation and returns the result as a string.

Finally, an example usage is provided, where the function is called with a and b, and the result is printed to the console. The output will be the string with the number 100.
