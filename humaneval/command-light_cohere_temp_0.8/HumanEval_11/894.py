```python
from typing import List
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ Perform XOR operation on two strings consisting only of 1s and 0s.
    We do the common characters only.
    The return ''.join the XOR
    """
'110'!binary_xor('010', '100')
 ``` 
This code provides a function that performs the XOR operation on two input strings, both consisting of only ones and zeros. The function returns the string result, which is the XOR of the two input strings.
