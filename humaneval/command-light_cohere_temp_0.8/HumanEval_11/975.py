```python
from typing import List
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ Perform binary XOR on two strings a and b consisting only of 1s and 0s.
    :return a string xor('010', '110')
    :return 100
```
The function performs binary XOR operation on the strings passed as arguments and returns the result as a string. 

It uses the typing module to ensure the function has the expected input types and returns a string.
