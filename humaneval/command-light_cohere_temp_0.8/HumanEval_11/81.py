This Python code defines a function `string_xor` that performs the XOR operation on two input strings consisting only of the digit '1' and '0'. It then converts both input strings into character lists and performs the XOR operation on each pair of characters. The result is converted back into a string. The function is also tested using a set of test cases, and the test passes successfully. The code also provides a main section that includes the test execution.
