Here's the Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of XORing strings:
```python
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ Perform XOR operation on two strings consisting only of 1s and 0s and return the result as a string.
    """
    string_xor('010', '110')
    # Output: 100
    """
    return a ^ b
```

This script provides a self-contained function that performs the XOR operation on two input strings and returns the result as a string. You can use this. Just to ensure the simple XOR operation on strings with only ones and zeros.
