This Python code defines a function called `string_xor`, designed to perform the XOR operation on two input strings consisting only of 1s and 0s. It employs a string matching with the `typing` module to ensure the input strings are treated as strings. The code includes a test cases to verify the correctness of the `string_xor` function. The test cases cover various scenarios, including different lengths, different characters, and strings containing only zeros. The `assert` statements are then used to check if the function's output matches the expected output for each test case, ensuring the function's correctness.
