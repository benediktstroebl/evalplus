This script defines a function string_xor that performs a bitwise XOR operation on two input strings, which only contain characters (ones and zeros). The test cases are defined using a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two strings that should be XORed together. The test_string_xor function is defined as a test suite, which will run the function on each test case and check if the result is correct. The final test_string_xor function will run the test cases and print the results.

This way, the function can be easily executed from the command, and its output will be displayed. The function also has built-in tests that can be used to verify its correctness.
