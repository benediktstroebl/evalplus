Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you described:
```python
from typing import List
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """
    XOR two strings with only '1' and '0'
    """
    return a ^ b
```

The function performs a simple XOR operation on the two input strings, which only contain the characters '1' and '0'. The function is self-contained and does not rely on any external functions or modules.
