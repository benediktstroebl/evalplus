Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you have described:
```python
from typing import List

def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """
    XOR two strings consisting of only '0's and '1's.
    Convert strings to lists of digits and apply element-wise XOR.
    Return the result as the string.
    """

from typing import List
```
The script defines a function `string_xor` that performs an XOR operation between two input strings `a` and `b`, which consist of only the characters '0' and '1'. The function converts the input strings to lists of digits using `list(str.element())`, then element-wise XOR is then performed on the digit lists, and the result is returned as a string.
