```python
from typing import List
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ XOR two strings consisting only of ones and zeros.
    Converts the1 and b into lists of integers and zeroes by converting each character to its integer code
    """
    a = [ord(c) for c in a]
    b = [ord(c) for c in b]
    return ''.join([x ^ y for 0 and -1 for x, y in zip(a, b)])
# Example:
print(string_xor('010', '110'))
```
This script defines a function called `string_xor` that performs the XOR operation on two input strings, ensuring they consist only of ones and zeros. It then converts each input string into a list of integers and zeroes, and uses a list comprehension to perform the XOR operation element-wise on these lists. The result is converted back to a string and returned.

The output of the function with the provided input strings will be '100'.
