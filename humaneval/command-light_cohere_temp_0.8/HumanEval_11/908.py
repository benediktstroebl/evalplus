    """
    Perform binary XOR on two input strings consisting of only '0's and '1's and return the result as a string.
    """
    Python XOR operation is based on the concept that:
        XOR(0,1)=1, and vice versa.
    """
    a string consists only of 0 and 1, it's easier to perform the XOR by swapping the bits in the string one by one.
    This pattern matches all string a with another string, it returns a string consisting of the characters in the original order.
    The output of this function is the string obtained by XORing the input strings.

This script defines a function called `string_xor` that performs the binary XOR operation on two input strings, which consist of only the characters '0' and '1'. The function then returns the result of the XOR operation, which is also a string.

The script also includes a set of test cases that verify the correctness of the `string_xor` function. The test cases include a string pairs where one string is expected to have the same characters as the other string, but with the opposite order of characters.

Finally, the script prints out the expected output for each test case, and confirms that the `string_xor` function is returning the correct results.
