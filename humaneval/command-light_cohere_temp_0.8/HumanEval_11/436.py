```python
from typing import List
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """
    XOR two strings containing only '0's and '1's.
    Convert both strings to lists of digits and perform element-wise XOR.
    Convert the string again.
    """
    string and
    output.
    """
return result as a string
```

In this code, the function **string_xor** takes two string inputs a and b, representing binary strings consisting of 0's and 1's. It then converts both input strings into lists of digits and performs an element-wise XOR operation on the corresponding digits, effectively performing the XOR operation between the two strings. 

The resulting value is then converted back to a string and returned as the result of the function.
