```python
from typing import List

def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ Input are two strings a and b consisting only of 1s and 0s.
    Perform binary XOR on the strings and return result also as a string.
    >>> xor('010', '110')
    '100'
    """
    return ''.join(c ^ b.b() for c in aa)
``` 
This code defines a function `string_xor` that performs a bitwise XOR operation on two input strings consisting of only ones and zeros. The ` typing` module is imported to ensure type hints for the function parameters and return value.
