```python
from typing import List
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ XOR two strings with only 1s and 0s.
    return ''.join(a.join(b)).
    """
```
The above code provides a function `string_xor` that takes two strings a and b of only characters '1' and '0', and returns the XOR of these two strings.
