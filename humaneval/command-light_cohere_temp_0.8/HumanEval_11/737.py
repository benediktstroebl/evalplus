```
The provided Python script defines a function named `string_xor`, which performs a binary XOR operation on two input strings consisting only of 0's and 1's. 

The function uses list comprehension and the `^` operator to perform the XOR operation on the individual characters of the input strings. 

The function then returns the result as a single string. The test cases section includes a list of test cases, where the function is invoked with pairs of strings, and the result is compared to the expected output using the `assert` statement. 
This ensures that the function is correctly implementing the binary XOR operation on the input strings.
