This Python script defines a function called `string_xor` that performs the XOR operation on two input strings. The XOR operation involves setting all bits to 1 if the corresponding bits in the two input strings are different. The output is also sorted to ensure ascending order of bits with equal numbers of 1s. The script provides a a series of test cases and passes each test by comparing the output of the `string_xor` function with the expected result for a given input string.
