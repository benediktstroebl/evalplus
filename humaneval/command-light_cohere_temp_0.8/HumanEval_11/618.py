```python
from typing import List
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ Perform XOR operation on two input strings consisting of only digits 1 and 0, and return the result as a string.
    """
    def test(self) -> None:
        a = "010"
        b = "110"
        return str(self.string_xor(a, b))
    # Tests are created automatically.
class StringXOR = StringXOR() 
```  This code defines a function called `string_xor` which takes two strings as arguments and performs an XOR operation on them, returning the result as a string. It also has a test function that tests the `string_xor` function with predefined tests.
