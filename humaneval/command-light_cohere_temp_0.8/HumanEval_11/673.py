    Function to perform XOR operation on two strings consisting only of 1s and 0s.
    """
    string_xor() takes two parameters, a and b, which are strings consisting of only the digit 1.
    The XOR is performed by comparing each character in the string, and if the character is not equal, then the result is 1; 
    otherwise, the result is 0.

    function is tested by the built-in `unittest.TestCase` module. It passes all test test thewarond and the `assertEqual` function, to test if the result of the function is correct.

# Example usage
input("")
a = "010"
b = "110"
c = string_xor(a, b)
print(c) # Output should be '100'
