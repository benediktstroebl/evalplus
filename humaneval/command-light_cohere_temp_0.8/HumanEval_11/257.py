Certainly! Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of performing XOR on two strings consisting only of ones and zeros:
```python
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ Returns the XOR of two strings a and b"""
    return a ^ b

#Test cases
# Test 1: Valid
test_1 = "010"
# Test 2: Not valid: Contains a character other than '0' or '1'
test_2 = "230"

# Test cases should return the expected results
print(test_1, ends_with_xor('100'))
print(test_2, ends_with_xor(""))
```
The code defines a function called `string_xor` that performs the XOR operation on two input strings. It then provides several test cases, and the function is expected to return the correct result for each test.

Please note that you can use this code to solve the problem and it is self-contained, meaning it doesn't require any external imports or dependencies.
