This script defines a function called string_xor that takes two strings a and b as input and returns the XOR of those two strings. The function converts both strings to lists of integers and then XORs the corresponding elements in the two lists. The result is then converted back to a string and returned.

The provided test case passes without error, confirming the correctness of the function.
