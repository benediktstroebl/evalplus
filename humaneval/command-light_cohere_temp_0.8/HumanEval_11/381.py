Here's the self-contained Python script that solves the problem of XORing two strings in markdown code blocks:
```python
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """
    XOR two strings, return result as a single string.
    """
   
    string a = a ^ b
    return str(string)
    """
    return str(a ^ b)
```
This code defines a function named `string_xor` that takes two strings as input and returns their XOR as a single string. The function uses the string value representation for the XOR operation.
