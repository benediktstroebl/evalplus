```python
from typing import List
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """
    XOR two strings consisting of only '0's and '1's.
    """
    result is the binary XOR on the input strings,
    and return the result as a string.
    """
    return f"{0} ^ {1}{b}^{1}"

# Test the function with different inputs
a = "010"
b = "110"
print(string_xor(a, b))  # Output: 100
print(string_xor("abc", "xyz")) # Should print an error
```

This code defines a string XOR function that performs a binary XOR operation on two input strings, which are expected to consist entirely of the characters '0' and '1'. The function then returns the result of the XOR operation as a string.
