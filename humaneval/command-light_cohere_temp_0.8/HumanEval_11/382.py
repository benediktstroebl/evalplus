This Python code defines a self-contained function `string_xor` that performs an XOR operation on two input strings, which consist only of the digit '1' or '0'. The function returns the result as a string. The code also includes test cases that cover all possible combinations of strings with a single character. Additionally, it has a test function that runs the test cases and checks if the `string_xor` function is producing the correct result for each test case.
