This Python code defines a function called `string_xor` that performs the XOR operation on two input strings. The function takes two strings as arguments, representing binary numbers consisting of only the digit '1' and converts them into lists of digits. The XOR operation is then performed by taking the reversed order of the digits from each input string and performing a bitwise XOR operation. The result is then converted back into a string and returned.

The code also includes a set of test cases, represented as a list of strings, that are passed to the `string_xor` function. The function processes each test strings and returns '0000', which is the binary representation of the XOR of the input strings. The test cases are then passed to the `string_xor` function and verified that the returned result matches the expected output ('0000').
