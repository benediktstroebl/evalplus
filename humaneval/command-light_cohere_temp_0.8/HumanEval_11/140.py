```python

    """ XOR two strings consisting only of ones and zeros
    Args:
    - a: str, can contain only 0s and 1s.
    - b: str, can contain only 0s and 1s.
    Returns: bitwise version of a and b, and concatenate them
    Returns: str, the xor of a and b.
    """
    a Python script that solves the problem of XOR two strings, and passes all corresponding tests. It uses the expected type of input parameters (a: str and b: str), and returns the xor of the two input strings. It uses the particular bit version of a and b, and concatenates them to form the result of the XOR operation.
