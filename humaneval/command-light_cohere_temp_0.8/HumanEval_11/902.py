```python
from typing import List
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ Perform binary XOR operation on two input strings a and b and return the result as a string.
    """
    The binary XOR operation is a bitwise operation that returns 1 if the bits of both inputs are different.
    """
    a list of characters contains the same characters as a and b, but in reverse order.
    """ return ''.join(a.join('', b)
   join str.")
``` 
This function takes two strings as input and performs a binary XOR operation on them. The result is then converted back to a string using the join() method. The XOR operation is a common and useful operation in various programming languages. 

Also, the typing module is used to define the function parameters with their type annotations. This helps to make the code more readable and descriptive.
