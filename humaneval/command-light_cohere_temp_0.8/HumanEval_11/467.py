```python
from typing import List
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ Perform XOR operation on two strings composed only of 1s and 0s and return the result as a string.
    """
    XOR is a bit-wise operation, where each digit of the result is the XOR of the corresponding digits of the two input strings.
    If example:
        Input:
        1010
        110
    Output:
        100

    Test Cases:
    - String XOR of '1010' and '110' should return '100'.
