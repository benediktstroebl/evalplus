Here's the improved Python code:
```python
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ Perform XOR operation on two strings composed of only digits 1 and 0 and return the result as a string. """
    return ''.join(a, b)
```

This code defines a function `string_xor` that takes two input strings `a` and `b` consisting of only digits '1' and '0', and performs the XOR operation on these input strings, and returns the result as a string.
