```python
from typing import List

def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ Function to perform XOR on two strings consisting only of 1s and 0s
    :param a: Input string consisting of only 0s and 1s.
    :param b: Input string consisting of only 0s and 1s
    :return: Result of XOR operation on a and b
    """
    # Remove all 0s from both strings
    a = ''.join('1' if char == '0' else '0' for char in a)
    b = ''.join('1' if char == '0' else '0' for char in b)
    return f"{a ^ b}"

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    ("010", "110"),
    ("1010", "0110"),
    ("1010", "1101"),
    # Add more test cases here...
]

# Test the function
for a, b in test_cases:
    result = string_xor(a, b)
    assert result == "".join(f"{a} XOR {b}")
``` 
The code provides a self-contained solution to the problem, which is to implement the XOR operation on two strings consisting only of 0s and 1s. It uses a per the strings and returns the result of the XOR operation. It also includes a test cases to validate the correctness of the function.
