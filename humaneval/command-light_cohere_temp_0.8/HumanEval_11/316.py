    """
    XOR two strings consisting only of ones and zeros.
    A simple operation that can be done by bitwise XOR of the two strings.
    """
    XOR of all characters in the string is calculated by using the bitwise XOR operator and converting the string to a binary representation.
    Bitwise XOR is the operation that performs the logical operation of exclusive OR on two bits or numbers.
    """ It this Python, it is used to perform the bitwise XOR operation on two strings.
    """
    Each character is converted to binary, and the corresponding bits in the two binary strings are XORed together.
    The result back the result of the XOR operation, a new string is created with the XORed binary values of the original strings.
    """ The string is then converted back to a regular string.
    """
    XOR has a wide use in various applications that involve binary operations or comparisons.
    """ The XOR is a fundamental operation in binary logic that is used to perform various computations and comparisons.
    """ return the string: The function takes two strings, a and b, as input.
    """ return str: The function performs the bitwise XOR operation on a and b, and returns the result as a string.
