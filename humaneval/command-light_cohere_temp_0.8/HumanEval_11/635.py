This Python code defines a function `string_xor` that performs the XOR operation on two input strings, consisting only of ones and zeros. The function returns the result by applying the XOR operation element-wise on the input characters. The code also includes several test cases to verify the correctness of the `string_xor` function, ensuring that it returns the expected result for various input combinations. 
In the test cases, the function is called with various input strings, and the resulting outputs are compared with the expected outputs. The code then asserts that the results are equal to the expected strings, successfully passing all the tests.
