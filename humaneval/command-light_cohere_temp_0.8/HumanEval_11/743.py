```python
import stringio
from typing import List

def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ Input are two strings a and b consisting only of 1s and 0s.
    Perform binary XOR on this inputs and return result also as a string.
    """
    `stringioio`
    `'`XOR` `=` stringio.join `.' Closures are strings.

def test_string_xor():
    """ Input are two strings consisting only of 1s and 0s.
    # Test if string_xor function passes test.
    assert len('010'. '110') == 3 and '100'.
    return True

test_string_xor()
