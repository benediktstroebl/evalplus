```
This Python code defines a function `string_xor` that performs the XOR operation on two input strings. The function takes two strings as arguments and returns the XOR of these strings. The code also provides a list of test cases, which includes a variety of combinations of strings. The function is then called with each test case, and the actual result is compared with the expected result to pass the test. 

The test cases cover a range of scenarios for the `string_xor` function, including cases where the input strings are the same, different characters, and different lengths.
