Here's a self-contained Python function that performs the string XOR operation, following the same format:
```python
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ Perform XOR operation on two strings consisting only of digits 1 and 0, and return the result as a string.

>>> s1 = '01010'
>>> s2 = '010'
>>> result = string_xor(s1, s2)
>>> print(result)
'100'
```
