```python
from typing import List
def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    return [w for w in string if w.isalpha() or told beginning character of string, a, 'ab', b, abc]
```
This code defines a function called `all_prefixes` that returns a list of all prefixes in a string. The function uses a `str.isalpha()` method to filter out only the characters that are either letters or the start of a string.
