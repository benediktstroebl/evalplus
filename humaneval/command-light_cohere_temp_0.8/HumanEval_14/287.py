```python
from typing import List
def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    return [part for part in string.string(). different character, one letter at a time, it could be an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, a digit, a space, punctuation, or special characters.]
def test_all_prefixes():
    assert all_prefixes("abc") == ['a', 'ab', 'abc'], "Assert failed: Incorrect output"
    assert all_prefixes("hello world") == [], "Assert failed: No valid prefixes found"
    assert all_prefixes("x") == [], "Assert failed: No valid prefixes found"
    assert all_prefixes("\t") == [], "Assert failed: No valid prefixes found"
if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_all_prefixes()
```
The problem solved here is to return a list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string, where a prefix is defined as a substring with one letter removed. 
The function uses a generator expression to iterate through the characters of the input string, and for each character, it checks whether it's one of the different characters and if so, it adds it to the result.
