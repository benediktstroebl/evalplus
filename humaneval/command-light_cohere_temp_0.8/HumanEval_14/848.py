```python
from typing import List
def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    return [prefix for prefix in string.string() if prefix.endswith('.')]

# unit tests
test_all_prefixes = [
    "abc".split() + [""]
    # Add more tests as needed
]
test_all_prefixes
test_all_prefixes()  # Run the tests
```

This code defines a function called all_prefixes, which returns a list of all prefixes in a given string, ensuring that the input is split into individual characters and the empty string at the end. 
The code then provides a set of test cases, all_prefixes, which is split into strings and empty strings. Finally, the `test_all_prefixes()` function is tested with the provided test cases.
