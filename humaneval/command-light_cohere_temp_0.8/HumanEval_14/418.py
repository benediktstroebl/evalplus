```python

    return [prefix for prefix in string.string(). strings on the  a list of all prefixes in the string
    string.
# Added test cases
Test cases for the all_prefixes function
    assert all_prefixes('abc') == ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
    assert all_prefixes('a') == ['a']
    assert all_prefixes('z') == []
    assert all_prefixes('123') == ['123']
    assert all_prefixes('abcde') == ['abcde']
    assert all_prefixes('') == []
```
This code defines a function called `all_prefixes` that takes a string as input and returns a list of all its prefixes. It uses a's list comprehension to iterate over all the characters in the string, and keeps track of the longest prefix seen so far, which will be the last character.  The way the this is that the list comprehension is currently limited to operate on a single character at a time, a more efficient approach would be to use a generator expression to create the list of all prefixes.
