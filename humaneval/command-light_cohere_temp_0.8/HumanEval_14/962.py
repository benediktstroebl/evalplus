```python
from typing import List

def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    return [''.join(''.join(prefix). Strings are joined the all other, and shortest possible, longest possible.

# Example string
test_ prefixes('abc')
# ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
```
This code defines a function called `all_prefixes` that takes a string as input and returns a list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string.

It uses the join() method to create a new prefix string from each character of the input string, and then uses the contains() method on a list of strings to filter out all prefixes from the new prefix strings.
