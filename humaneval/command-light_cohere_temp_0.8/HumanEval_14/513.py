```python
from typing import List
def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    return [''.join(char) for char in string if char.start(char) and 1 or
    the
    """ Returns list of all prefixes of the input string.
    """

``` 
The function uses list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string and filters out any characters that are not the beginning of a word, returning a list of prefixes from shortest to longest. This provides a all test and can be used in markdown code blocks to create clear, readable code.
