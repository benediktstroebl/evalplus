```python
from typing import List
def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    return ["".join_compat(i) for i in string.
    ) as List[abc
```

This function iterates through each character in the string and creates a new list item for each character. The list of items is then converted into a list of prefixes using the `List` constructor.
