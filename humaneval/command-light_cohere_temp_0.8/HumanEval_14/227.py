```python
from typing import List
def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    return [''.join(char) for char in string if char != '']
```
We've encapsulated the prefix extraction logic into the all_prefixes() function and employed list comprehension along with the Built-In string. Hope method to create concise and readable prefixes.

We also introduce a type hint using from typing, which improves the code clarity and helps catch potential type-related errors. The function returns a a list of prefixes extracted from the input string.
