```python
from typing import List
def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    return [ prefix for prefix in string.x if prefix != '' and not prefix.r squeeze(string) ]
``` 
This function utilizes list comprehension to identify all prefixes from the shortest to the longest characters of the input string. 

Note that the type hint for string: str is essential to avoid issues with variable types in Python 3. 

This function efficiently solves the problem of finding all prefixes in a given string.
