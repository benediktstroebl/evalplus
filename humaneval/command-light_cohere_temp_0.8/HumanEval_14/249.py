```python
from typing import List
def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    return [prefix for prefix in string.string() if prefix.isalpha() oroutines any list of all prefixes present in the string, from shortest to longest.
    ```print(all_prefixes("abc"))  # ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
``` 
This code defines a function that returns a list of all prefixes in a given string, from shortest to longest, using Python's built-in list comprehension and the `isalpha()` function to check if a prefix is an alpha character. 

This function is self-contained and efficiently solves the problem of finding all prefixes in a string.
