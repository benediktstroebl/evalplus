```python
from typing import List
def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    return [prefix for prefix in string.py.lower() for string(string).
    for i in range(string):
        if i != ' ':
            break
            if i.isalpha():
                prefix += i
```
This code defines a function that returns a list of all prefixes from the shortest to the longest of the input string. It does this by iterating through the string and checking for space. It then checks if the string[i] is not space, and if it is not, it is an alpha character, it adds the character to the current prefix. If it is not an space or an alpha, the loop is broken.
