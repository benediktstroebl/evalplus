```python
from typing import List

def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    return [prefix for prefix in string.ph string.split()
    11021221
    general 
    }
``` 
This code defines a function called `all_prefixes` that takes a string as input and returns a list of all prefixes in the string, from shortest to longest. This is done by using the `split()` method to split the string into a list of prefixes. The list of prefixes is then returned.
