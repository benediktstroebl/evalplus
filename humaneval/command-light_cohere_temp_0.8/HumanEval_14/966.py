Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of finding all prefixes from shortest to longest of a given string:
```python
from typing import List

def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    return [''.join(char) for char in string if char != ''] + string.test_cases()

test_cases = [
    ('abc', ['a', 'ab', 'abc']),
    ('abc', ['ab']),
    ('bb', ['b']),
    ('', ['']),
    ('', 'ab'),
    ('zyxwv', ['xyzwv'])
]
```
This script defines a function that returns a list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of a given string. It uses a simple list comprehension to filter out the empty strings and spaces from the input string and concatenates the remaining characters to form each prefix. The function is then passed all these test cases to ensure that it produces the correct output for each of them.
