```python
from typing import List
def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    return [ prefix for prefix in string.String.split() if any_prefix is the shortest and sorted()
    ```

All code is in the same place and this script is a self-contained solution to the problem. It starts by importing the string methods from the typing module and defines the all_prefixes function that returns a list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string.
