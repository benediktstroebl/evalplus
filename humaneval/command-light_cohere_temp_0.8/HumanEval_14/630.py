This Python code defines a function called all_prefixes that calculates and returns a list of all prefixes in the input string. The code also includes a set of test cases, each consisting of an input string and the expected output of the all_prefixes function for that string. The code then iterates through each test case and compares the actual output with the expected output. 

Note: This script is self-contained and can be executed independently, as it contains all the necessary functionality and tests within it.
