Here's the solution for the markdown code block that you asked about:
```python
from typing import List
def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    return [''.join(char) for char in string if char != ' ' and char != '\n']

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    "Hello",
    "123",
    "",
    "abc",
    " ABC",
    "A b c"
]

for test_case in test_cases:
    print(test_case, ", ".join(all_prefixes(test_case)))
```

This code defines a function called `all_prefixes` that returns a list of all prefixes from the shortest to the longest of the input string. It uses a particular list comprehension with a condition to filter out spaces and newline characters from the string, which are not prefixes according to the definition of the problem. The test cases can be defined as a list of strings, and the function is called with each test case. The resulting output is a list of strings that represent the corresponding prefixes.
