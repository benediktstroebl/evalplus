```python
from typing import List
def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    return [prefix for prefix in string.full.split() if string.split()
    Mines prefixes and
    to be all of the characters in a given string, this function will return a list of all prefixes, from shortest to longest.

In this version, the `all_prefixes()` function splits the input string into a list of characters and then creates a new list containing all possible prefixes by using the `split()` method. 

This is a self-contained and concise solution to the problem.
