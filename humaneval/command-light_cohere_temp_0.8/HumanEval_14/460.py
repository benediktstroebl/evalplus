Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of finding all prefixes from shortest to longest of a given string:
```python
def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    return [''.join(x) for x in string.
    # Your strings that only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces
    x = string.join()
    str.maketup opt
    Technologies a two cases,
    """
    case 1:
        >>> all_prefixes('ab')
        ['a', 'ab']
        """
    """
    case 2:
        >>> all_prefixes('abc')
        ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
        """
}
```
