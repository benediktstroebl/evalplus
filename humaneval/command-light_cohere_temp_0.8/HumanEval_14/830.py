```python
from typing import List
def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    return [prefix for prefix in string.full().
    ```
    a sequence of prefixes in string, in order of length, from shortest to longest
```. This function utilizes a type hint from the function parameters to return a list of all prefixes in the string, from shortest to longest.

This function is self-contained and requires only the input string to solve the problem.
