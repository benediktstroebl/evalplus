test_grade_equation()

```python
# Our function
grades = [4.0, 3.3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]
test_grade_equation(grades)
# Print the output
print(test_grade_equation('A+'))

# Now let's create a dynamic table
table = ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']
test_grade_equation(table)
```
This script defines a function called `grade_equation` that takes a list of grades as input and returns a list of letter grades. 

The function uses a helper function called `grade_table` to create a string representation of the grades table.

The `test_grade_equation` function is a test case that creates a list of grades and passes it to the `grade_equation` function. The function then prints the string of characters that represents the grades table. 

Note: This code assumes that the input list of grades is sorted in ascending order. If the input list is not sorted, the output may be incorrect.
