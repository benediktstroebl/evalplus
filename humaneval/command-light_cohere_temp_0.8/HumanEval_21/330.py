Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem you've described:
```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    # Apply a linear transform to the input list to ensure that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1
    numbers[0] = 0
    numbers[1] = 1
    for num in numbers[2:]:
        num = ((num - numbers[0]) / (numbers[1] - numbers[0])) * (numbers[1] - numbers[0])) + numbers[0]
    return numbers

# Example usage:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5]

rescale_to_unit(numbers)
# Output: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

Note that the function was designed to ensure that the input values are scaled appropriately to the range [0, 1].
