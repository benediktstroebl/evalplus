```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1.

    If the numbers [x] has at least two elements, we check if the list is not empty, and if the second element is greater than the first one, we multiply both by 0.75, which scales down all values to fit the range [0,1]

    If the list is empty or the second element is not greater than the first one, we return the list as it is.

In other cases, we apply the linear transformation on the list:
    numbers = [x * 0.75 for x in numbers]
    return numbers
