Here's the solution:
```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
    """
    numbers[0] = 0  # Set smallest element to 0
    numbers[1] = 1  # Set largest element to 1
    return numbers
``` 

The function rescale_to_unit accepts a list of numbers and returns a modified list with the requested scaling. The function works by updating the smallest number in the list to 0 and the largest number to 1.
