Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem:

```python
def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    # Apply the linear transformation to the list of numbers
    return [0 if x <= 0 else x for x in numbers]
```

This function uses a list comprehension to apply a linear transformation to the input list of numbers. It uses the same condition x <= 0 to flip all the numbers in the list if they are smaller than 0, ensuring that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. 

The function returns the list of numbers after the transformation has been applied.
