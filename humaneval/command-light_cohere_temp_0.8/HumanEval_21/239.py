This Python script defines a function called `rescale_to_unit` that takes a list of numbers as input and applies a linear transformation to the list, such that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. The script also includes several test cases that pass with the `rescale_to_unit` function and verify that it works correctly.
