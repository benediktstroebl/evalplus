Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from typing import List


def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1.
    """
    return [numbers] * [0.0, 1.0]
```

# Example usage
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
rescale_unit(numbers)
```

This Python script defines a function `rescale_to_unit` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each number has been scaled to be between 0 and 1. The function uses the typing to return the result as a list of float values, which are the rescaled input numbers. The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with a list of numbers and prints the result.
