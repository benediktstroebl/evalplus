```

This function, `rescale_to_unit`, takes a list of numbers and applies a linear transformation to it, such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1. The function achieves this transformation by subtracting the smaller number from the larger number in the list and then dividing by the ratio of the larger number to the smaller number. The function then returns the result.
