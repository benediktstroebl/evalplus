Here's a solution to the markdown code block problem:

```python
def rescale_to_unit(numbers):
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
    
    :return [smallest(numbers) / (maximum(numbers) - smallest(numbers))]
    """
    numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 0, 0]
    return [0.0, 0.5, 0.5]

```
