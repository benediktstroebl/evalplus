```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1.
    
    The function takes in a list of numbers and returns the same list, but each number has been rescaled to lie between 0 and 1.
    would be represented as the0 and 2.0, respectively.
    numbers = [ [list of numbers to be rescaled]
    return [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]
   0, 0.0, 0]
``` 
In this script, we define the rescale_to_unit function, which takes in a list of numbers and returns the same list, but each number has been rescaled to lie between 0 and 1.0, respectively. The function is a input list of numbers and returns the same list, but each number has been rescaled to lie between 0 and 1.0, which is the smallest number in the input list.
