This Python code defines a function called rescale_to_unit that takes a list of numbers as input. It performs a rescaling on the input numbers, where the smallest number is transformed to 0, and the largest number becomes 1. The function handles both scenarios, where the list has at least two elements or fewer than two, ensuring that the transformation is applied correctly.
