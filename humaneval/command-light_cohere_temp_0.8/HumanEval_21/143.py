```python
from typing import List
def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1.

    : Input:
    numbers: List[float] - List of numbers.
    Output:
    numbers_rescaled: List[float] - Rescaled numbers after applying the linear transform.

    # Example test code
    test:
    numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
    test out function that numbers after applying the rescale_to_unit function.
