```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
    
    numbers = [numbers[0] / min(numbers)] + [min(numbers)]
    return numbers
