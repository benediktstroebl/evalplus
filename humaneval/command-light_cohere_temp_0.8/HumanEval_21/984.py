Here's a self-contained Python function that addresses the markdown code block problem:

```python
def rescale_to_unit(numbers):
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1.
    
    numbers = [x[0] / max(numbers), 1)
    numbers[0] = 0
    numbers[1] = 1
    return numbers
```

This function uses the list of numbers as its parameter. It applies a specific linear transformation to that list, such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1. The function then returns the values of the list, where the numbers have been scaled to the range [0, 1].
