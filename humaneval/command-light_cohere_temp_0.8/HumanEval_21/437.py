Here's the solution:
```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    # Apply a linear transform to that list, such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
    return [x/abs(x) for x in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with each element divided by the absolute value of that number. This results in a numbers being a linear transformation that scales the values to the range [0, 1].

This script can be used to test the function with various input lists and verify the expected output.
