print(numbers)

This code defines a function called `rescale_to_unit` that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list where the values have been rescaled to a range from 0 to 1. The test code section then applies this function to a list of numbers and prints the result. 

This test code does the following:

- Creates a list of numbers `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 0]` that represents a set of values that need to be rescaled. 
- Applies the `rescale_to_unit` function to the list of numbers and stores the result in the `numbers` variable.
- Prints the list of numbers `[1.0, 0.0, 0, 4.0, 1.0]` that represents the exact values from the original list that needed to be rescaled.
