Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of scaling a list of numbers to a unit range:

```python
def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    # Apply the transformation to numbers
    numbers_transformed = [x / (x + 1) for x in numbers]
    # Return the transformed numbers
    return numbers_transformed

# Test cases
test_rescale_to_unit = [
    [0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, -.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0], 0.0, 0.5
]

test_resale_to_unit_output = [0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0]


test_resale_to_unit_Pass = test_rescale_to_unit_output == test_rescale_to_unit_output

```
This script defines a function called rescale_to_unit which accepts a list of numbers and returns a new list where each element has been scaled so that it is between 0 and 1. 

The function achieves this by using the formula x / (x + 1) for each number in the input list. 

This is a self-contained function that solves the problem of scaling a list of numbers to a unit range.
