Here's the self-contained Python script:
```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    # Apply a linear transform to that list, such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
    numbers[0] = 0
    numbers[1] = 1
    return numbers

def test_rescale_to_unit():
    assert rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5]) == [List([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0]) is [0.0, 1.0, 0]) is [0.0, 0] is [0.0, 1.0] is [1.0, 0] is [0.0, 1.0, 1]

def test_args():
    assert rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0]) == [([0.0, 0.0, 0]) is [0.0, 1.0, 0]) is [0.0, 1.0, 0] is [0.0, 0] is [0.0, 1.0] is [1.0, 0]

test_rescale_to_unit()

Note that the `rescale_to_unit` function is a self-contained Python script that applies a linear transformation to a list of numbers, such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1. The test functions are used to verify that the `rescale_to_unit` function behaves correctly with various input scenarios.
