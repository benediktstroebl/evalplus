Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    # check for length of list greater than 2
    if len(numbers) > 2:
        return numbers

    # initialize result list to copy input list
    result_list = numbers[:]

    # create a new list to store the transformed numbers
    transformed_numbers = [0.0] + [result_list[1:] * 1]

    # combine the transformed numbers list with the result list
    result_list.append(transformed_numbers)

    return result_list

```
This Python code defines a function called `rescale_to_unit` that transforms a list of numbers into a new list where each element is scaled to be between 0 and 1. The function starts by checking if the length of the input list is greater than 2. If this condition is met, the function simply returns the original input list, which is not scaled. Otherwise, the function proceeds to initialize a new list called `result_list` to store the original list of numbers. Then, a new list named `transformed_numbers` is created by prepending the transformed numbers to the `result_list` and then multiplying each element in `result_list` by 1. Finally, the function combines the list by appending the `transformed_numbers` list to the `result_list`, and then returns the combined list.
