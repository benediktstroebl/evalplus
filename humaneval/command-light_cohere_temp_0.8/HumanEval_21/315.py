Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of scaling down numbers in a list:
```python
def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
    
    :param numbers: List[float] 
        return: List[float]
    numbers = [x/100.0 for x in numbers]
    return numbers
```

This function, rescale_to_unit, takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with the same numbers, but each scaled down by a factor of 0.0. The script then also provide a test with the test code you provided, and the function returns the result.
