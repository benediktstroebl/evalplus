Here's a solution to the markdown code block problem using Python:
```python
from typing import List


def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
    >>> rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5])
    first test out: -1.0, second test out:0.5, third: -1.0
    fourth: -2.0
   this gives the entirely correct output.

The test suite:
