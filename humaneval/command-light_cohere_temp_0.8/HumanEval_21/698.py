This Python script defines a function called **`rescale_to_unit`** that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list of numbers after applying a linear transformation to the original input list, ensuring that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1.

The test cases are defined as well, and the **`test_rescale_to_unit`** function is used to verify that the function correctly applies the linear transformation to the input list.
