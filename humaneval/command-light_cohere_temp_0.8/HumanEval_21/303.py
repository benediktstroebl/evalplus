The function `rescale_to_unit` takes a list of numbers as input and applies a linear transformation to that list, such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1. The function then returns the list of numbers after the transformation. 

The function `test_rescale_to_unit` takes a list of test cases as input and applies the `rescale_to_unit` function to each number in the test cases. The function then compares the results to the expected values and prints out the original test case and the expected result.
