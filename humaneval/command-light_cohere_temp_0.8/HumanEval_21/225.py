This Python code defines a function called rescale_to_unit that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list where each value has been scaled to the unit [0, 1] range. 

The function first asserts that the input list is a list of at least two elements, then applies a linear transformation to the list, such that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. The function then returns the list of numbers with values scaled to the unit [0, 1] range. 

Additionally, the code provides a set of tests that are passed to the function to verify its correctness.
