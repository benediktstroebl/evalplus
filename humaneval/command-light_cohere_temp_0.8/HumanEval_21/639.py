Here's the solution to the markdown code block problem:

```python
def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    # Initialize list to [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 0.0]
   0.5, 0]
    then 0.0, 1.0
    to match a numbers to the range [0.0, 1.0] with a smallest value of 0 and the largest value of 1.0.
    number_list = [numbers / 1.0]
   0
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        if numbers[i] == 0:
            number_list[i] = 0
        elif numbers[i] == 1:
            number_list[i] = 1
        else:
            number_list[i] = numbers[i] / 1.0
   
# Return the list of rescaled numbers.

```

This Python code defines a function `rescale_to_unit` that transforms a list of numbers into a unit scale. The function initializes the numbers to [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 0.0] and then0, 0] with a ratio of 1.0, effectively scaling down the numbers to the range [0.0, 1.0] while keeping the for each number, if the original number is 0, it is assigned 0 in the rescaled list; if the original number is 1, it is assigned 1 in the rescaled list; for any other number, the original number is divided by 1.0 and the result in the rescaled list. The code effectively scales the and transforms the numbers in the list while preserving the relative ordering.
