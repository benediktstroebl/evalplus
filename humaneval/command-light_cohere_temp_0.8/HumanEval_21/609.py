Here's the Python script with the self-contained function `rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float])` that solves the problem of scaling numbers in a list to the unit range of 0 to 1:

```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
    
    numbers = [numbers[1:] / (numbers[0] - numbers[1])) - 1.0] + numbers[0]
    """
    return numbers
```
