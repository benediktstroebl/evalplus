This script defines a function `rescale_to_unit` that takes in a list of numbers and returns a new list where each number has been rescaled to the unit of 1.

The function first checks if the list has at least two elements and raises a `ValueError` exception if not. Then, the function defines a helper function to get the index of the smallest number in the list. Then, the function applies the transformation to each element in the list by negating it and adding it to the smallest number in the list.

Finally, the function returns the new list.
