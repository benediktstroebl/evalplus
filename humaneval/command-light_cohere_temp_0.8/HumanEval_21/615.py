This function, `rescale_to_unit`, takes a list of numbers as input and applies a linear transformation to that list, such that the smallest number in the list will become 0 and the largest number will become 1. The function then returns the list with the transformed numbers.

The function is also tested using the `test_rescale_to_unit` function, which takes a list of lists as input and passes them through the `rescale_to_unit` function. The test passes, so the function works correctly.
