```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
    Test Cases:
    >>> rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 0.0, 0])
   
    0.834567

>>> rescale_to_unit([0.75, 0.0, 1.0, 5])
   RETURN:  [0.0834568, 0.0, 0.0]

>>> rescale_to_unit([0.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0])
    return [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]
