This script defines a function called `rescale_to_unit` that takes a list of numbers as an argument. It then uses the maximum and minimum values from the input list to calculate the scale factor, and applies this scale factor to the list, ensuring that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. This script can be used to test the function with various test cases, and the results are printed to the console.
