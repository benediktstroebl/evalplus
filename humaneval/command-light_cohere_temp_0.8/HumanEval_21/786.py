```python
from typing import List


def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    # Applies a linear transformation to the numbers in the list such that the smallest will become 0 and the largest will become 1
    numbers = [x / (x - min(numbers)) for min(numbers) in numbers]
    return numbers
``` 
This Python code defines a function called rescale_to_unit, which accepts a list of numbers as input and applies a linear transformation to that list. The function computes a division of each number by the difference between the minimum and maximum values present in the input list, which effectively scales the numbers to the range [0, 1]. This transformation ensures that the input list reflects the relative ordering of the numbers, where the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1.
