Here's the solution to the markdown code block:

```python
from typing import List


def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1.

    # Define the
     List of numbers that you want to rescale.
    numbers = [List[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5])

     # Apply the rescaling operation
    numbers = [num / max(numbers) for num in numbers]
    return numbers
```

This Python function, named `rescale_to_unit`, takes a list of numbers and applies a linear transformation to that list, such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1. The function uses the minimum value of each number in the list as the denominator and the maximum value as the numerator. The result of the function is a new list with the rescaled values.
