Here's the solution:
```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    # Apply a linear transformation to the list of numbers to ensure that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1
    numbers = [x / max(numbers) for x in numbers]
    return numbers

# Test case:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
printable.
numbers = rescale_to_unit(numbers)
print(numbers)
```
This Python script defines a function called `rescale_to_unit` that takes a list of numbers as input. The function applies a linear transformation to the list of numbers, ensuring that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. It achieves this by dividing each number in the list by the largest value, which is obtained using the `max` function. The test case demonstrates how the output will be `[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]`
 print(numbers) to display the transformed list.
