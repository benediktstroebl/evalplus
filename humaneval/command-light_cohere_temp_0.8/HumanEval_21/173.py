This Python code defines a function `rescale_to_unit` that transforms a list of numbers to have the smallest value become 0 and the largest value become 1. The function uses the `List[float]` syntax to define a list of floating-point numbers, and uses list comprehension to apply the transformation to each number in the list.

The test cases in this code check the functionality of the `rescale_to_unit` function by passing different lists of numbers and verifying that the transformed lists produce the expected output.

This code provides a self-contained function that solves the problem of scaling a list of numbers to have the smallest value become 0 and the largest value become 1, and passes corresponding tests.
