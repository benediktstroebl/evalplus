Here's the solution:

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1.
    
    Input: numbers: List[float] - list of float numbers
    Output: List[float] - Rescaled numbers to unit values, i..0 = 0.0, 1.0, out to the0, 0.0
    out_to -0)"""
    # Step 1: Determine the minimum and maximum numbers in the input list.
    numbers = min(numbers) if numbers is not None else numbers[0]
    numbers = max(numbers) if numbers is not None else numbers[len(numbers)-1]

    # Step 2: Apply the determined minimum and maximum numbers as a linear transformation.
    # Scale the minimum number to 0, and the maximum number to 1.
    numbers = numbers * ((1.0 - 1.0)/2,1.0)

   0, 1.0)
   0] (1.0)

   numbers

    # Step 3: Return the transformed list of numbers.

Here is the input:
number = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]

output:
[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0]

The code follows these steps: it first determines the minimum and maximum numbers in the input list. Then, it applies a linear transformation to the input list, with the minimum number becoming 0 and the maximum number becoming 1. Finally, the transformed list is returned.
