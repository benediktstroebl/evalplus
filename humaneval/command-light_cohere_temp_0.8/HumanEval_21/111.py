Here's the self-contained Python script that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List


def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
    >>> rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5])
   2.0, 0.5]

   0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
   0.0, 0.5

   return
""" numbers in the list, the function applies a linear transformation to that list, such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1. 

# Test cases
print(rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5]))
print(rescale_to_unit([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0]))
print(rescale_to_unit([1, 2, 3]))
``` 
This code defines a function called `rescale_to_unit`, which takes in a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with the numbers rescaled according to the range 0 to 1. The function works by applying a linear transformation to the input list, which is defined by the function.
