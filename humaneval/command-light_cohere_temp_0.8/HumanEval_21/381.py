Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests:

```python
from typing import List


def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
    Test:
    assert rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4]) == [([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0])
    dry numbers are 0.0, 0.0, 0]
   numbers are [0.0, 2.0, 3] (rescaling_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3])) and is equal
    assert rescale_to_unit([0.0, 0]) == [0.0, 0] and is correct
    assert rescale_to_unit([0.0, 0.0]) == [0.0] and is an linear transformation to that list, such that the first element will become 0.
