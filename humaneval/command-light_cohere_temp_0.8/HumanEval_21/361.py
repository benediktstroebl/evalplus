```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
    
    The function takes a list of numbers and applies a linear transformation to that list. This transformation ensures that the smallest number in the list will become 0, and the largest number will become 1. The function then returns a list of the rescaled numbers.

In this solution, we have a rescale_to_unit function that accepts a list of numbers and applies a linear transformation to it, ensuring that the numbers are scaled between 0 and 1.

The function works by first checking if the length of the given list numbers is at least two elements. If it is, it applies the linear transformation to the list, where the transformation is a simple multiplication by a constant scaling factor. This constant scaling factor ensures that the smallest number in the list becomes 0 and the largest number becomes 1. 

This approach is well-suited for scaling a list of numbers up to a range of 0 to 1, as expected in the original problem.
