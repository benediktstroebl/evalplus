```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    # Ensure the list has at least two elements
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Input list must contain at least two elements")

    # Apply a linear transform to that list,
    # such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
    numbers = [0.0] + numbers[reverse]
    numbers = [x / float(abs(x)) for x in numbers]
    return numbers
```
This code defines a function called `rescale_to_unit` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with the numbers scaled to the unit between 0 and 1. The function first checks if the list has at least two elements and raises a ValueError if this condition is not met. It then applies a rescaling process to each element of the list using the formula `x / float(abs(x))`. The `abs` function is used to get the absolute value of each element, and the result is then divided by the absolute value to scale the number to the desired unit.
