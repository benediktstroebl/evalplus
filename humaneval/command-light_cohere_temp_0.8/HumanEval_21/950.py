Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of rescaling a list of numbers in markdown code blocks:

```python
from typing import List


def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1.
    >>> rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5])
   0.0, 0]
```

The function works by applying a linear transformation to the input list of numbers, such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1. The function returns a list of the same numbers, but rescaled to the range [0, 1].
