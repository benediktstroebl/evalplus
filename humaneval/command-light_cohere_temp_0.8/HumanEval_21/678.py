Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the given problem:

```python
def rescale_to_unit(numbers):
    # Convert list of numbers to a tuple of (min, max) values
    min_val, max_val = tuple(sorted((n for n in numbers if n < 0)))
    # Apply a linear transformation to the numbers
    numbers = [n / max_val for n in numbers]
    # Return the transformed list
    return numbers
```

This function takes a list of numbers as an input and returns a list of numbers that have been rescaled to the unit range of 0 to 1. The function first converts the critical part of the problem, where it calculates the smallest and largest numbers in the input list and creates a tuple of those values. The tuple is then sorted in ascending order, ensuring that the smallest value becomes the first element of the tuple. The function then applies a linear transformation by dividing each number in the input list by the largest value. The transformed list is then returned as the output of the function.
