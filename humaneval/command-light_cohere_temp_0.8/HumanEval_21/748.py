Here's the solution to the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1.

    numbers = [0.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5]
   0
    [0.0, 0.0, 0]

    numbers
    """ return: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1]
    # rescale the_to_unit function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of numbers after applying a linear transform to that list. This function ensures that the minimum number in the list will become 0 and the maximum will become 1.

In this solution, the function takes a list of numbers and applies a linear transformation to the list. It ensures that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1. The function then returns the minimum scaled number in the list, which is 0.
