This code defines a Python script with a self-contained function `rescale_to_unit` that solves the problem of transforming a list of numbers to have all values between 0 and 1, while passing corresponding tests. It ensures that the input is a list of numbers and applies a linear transformation to that list, such that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. The `test_rescale_to_unit` function tests the `rescale_to_unit_to_unit` function with a sample input and invalid input, it passes the test cases to the function and checks if the result is correct.
