This Python code defines a function named rescale_to_unit that transforms a given list of numbers into a unit scale. The function takes a list of float numbers as input and returns a new list with all values set to either 0 or 1. 

The rescale_to_unit function applies a linear transformation to the input list, such that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. 

The code also defines a function test() that creates a list of numbers [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5] and passes it to the rescale_to_unit function to create a new list with all values set to 0 or 1. The test function then prints the list to the console. 

Finally, the code runs the test function, which passes the list of numbers [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5] to the function and prints the result to the console.
