Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of scaling numbers in a list to a unit range:

```python
def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    # Ensure at least two elements in the input list
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Input list must contain at least two elements")
    
    # Apply a linear transform to scale to unit range
    numbers[0] = 0
    numbers[1] = 1
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        num = (num - numbers[0]) / (numbers[1] - numbers[0])
    return numbers
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and ensures that the list contains at least two elements. Then, it applies a linear transform formula to scale each number in the list to the unit range of [0,1]. The formula works by subtracting the smallest number from the entire list, then dividing the resulting difference by the difference between the largest number and the smallest number.

This function successfully scales the numbers in the list to the unit range. It raises a error if the input list has fewer than two elements.
