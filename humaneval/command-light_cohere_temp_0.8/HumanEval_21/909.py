Here's the solution:
```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    # Ensure has at least two elements
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Input list must have at least two elements")

    # Apply a linear transform to that list, such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
    numbers[0] = 0 if numbers[0] < 0 else numbers[0]
    numbers[0] = 1.0 if numbers > 0 else
   0

    numbers[1] = 1.0 if numbers < 1 else numbers[1] = 0.0

   0

    numbers[1] = 1.0 if numbers < 0.0 else numbers0

   0

    return numbers
```

This function ensures that the input list has at least two elements and then applies a linear transformation to those numbers. It is designed to handle cases where the input list has only one element (which is not a valid input for this function) and raises a ValueError exception.
