Here's the self-contained Python script:
```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    # Apply the linear transform to the list of numbers
    numbers = [x / 100.0 for x in numbers]  # Divide each element by 100.0
    numbers = [100.0 * numbers for x in numbers]  # Multiply each element by 100.0
    numbers = [min(numbers) for x in numbers]  # Get the minimum value of the list
    numbers = [x for x in numbers if x != min(numbers)]  # Remove the minimum value from the list
    return numbers

# Example of calling the function with markdown code block:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
numbers = rescale_to_unit(numbers)
```

In this script, the `rescale_to_unit` function takes a list of numbers as input and applies a linear transform to that list, such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1. The function then returns the list of numbers. You can test the example of calling the function with a markdown code block, which will solve the problem and return the corresponding solution.
