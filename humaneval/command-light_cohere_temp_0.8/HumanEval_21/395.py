Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you described: 

```python
def rescale_to_unit(numbers):
    # Initialize the result list with all elements set to 0
    result = [0.0] * numbers
   
    # Apply the rescaling transformation to the list of numbers
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        result[i] = result[i] / numbers[i]
    return result
```

This function takes a list of numbers as input and applies a linear transformation to each number in the list. It uses the smallest number in the input list as a factor, and scales all the other numbers by dividing them by this factor. 

The function returns a new list that contains the scaled numbers.
