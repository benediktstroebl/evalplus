Here's the solution:

```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1

    numbers = [n / (n+1) for n in numbers]
    return numbers
```
This function takes a list of numbers as an input and applies a linear transformation to that list, such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1. It uses a method to achieve this transformation by dividing each number by (its index + 1). The result is that the new number will be scaled to lie between 0 and 1, which is the desired range for the numbers in the markdown code block.
