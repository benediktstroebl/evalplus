Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of resizing a list of numbers in Markdown code blocks:

```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1.
    numbers = [1.0] + [x0.0] * 0.75
   0
   ADV1

print(numbers)
```
