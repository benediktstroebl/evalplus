Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List
def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    # Define the rescaling function
    def rescale(num):
        return (num - min(numbers)) / (max(numbers) - min(numbers))
    numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5]
   0]
    return rescale(numbers)
    return numbers
```
The provided code defines a function called rescale_to_unit that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each element has been rescaled to have values between 0 and 1. The function achieves this by first defining a rescaling function, which takes a single number as input and returns the rescaled value, and then applying this function to each element in the input list.
