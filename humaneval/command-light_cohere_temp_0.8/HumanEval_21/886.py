Here is a self-contained Python script that includes a function to solve the problem:
```python
from typing import List
def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
    :param numbers: List[float]
    :return: List[float]
    numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
   2.8]
   0, 0.0, 0}
    for x in the list such that it is equal to 0, or less. The transformed list will have its elements scaled by a factor of 1/x, where x is the minimum element in the original list. 
```
This Python script defines a function called `rescale_to_unit`, which takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns a new list where each number has been rescale to the unit of 0 or 1. 

To test the function, a test case is provided in the script. This test case is designed to pass if the function is implemented correctly.
