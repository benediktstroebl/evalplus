    # Ensure the list has at least two elements
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Input list must have at least two elements")
    # Apply linear transformation to ensure the range [0, 1]

```
The provided code defines a Python function named `rescale_to_unit` that transforms a list of numbers to a unit between 0 and 1. The function performs this test for a list of input test cases to ensure it can handle at least two elements. The function calculates the result by applying a linear transformation to each number in the input list and then normalizes the result to have values between 0 and 1. This helps solve the
            problem of scaling values to fit a unit range.
