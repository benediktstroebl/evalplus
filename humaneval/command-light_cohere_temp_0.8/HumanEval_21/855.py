```python
from typing import List
def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    # Apply a linear transformation to the list of numbers
    numbers = [x * 1.0 + y * 1.0 for x, y in numbers] for x in numbers]
    return [min(numbers), max(numbers)]
```

This script provides a function called rescale_to_unit, which takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns a new list with the numbers rescaled to the unit range [0, 1]. The function uses a list comprehension to calculate the new values for x and y, where x and y are multiplied by 1 and added to the corresponding original number. The function then returns a smallest and largest number in the list, which are guaranteed to be 0 and 1, respectively, due to the linear transformation applied to the list.
