Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the given problem:
```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    # Apply a linear transform to that list, such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
    numbers = [x / 100.0 for x in numbers] + [1.0] * [numbers[1.0] * [0]
    - [0.0, 1.0, 2.0] + [numbers where.5, 3]  # [0.0, 0.0]
   0.0, 0]

    result
```

This function takes a list of numbers as an input and applies a linear transform to that list, such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1. The function then returns the result.
