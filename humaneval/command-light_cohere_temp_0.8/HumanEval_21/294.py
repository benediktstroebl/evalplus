This code defines a function called rescale_to_unit that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list where all the numbers have been scaled to be between 0 and 1. The test cases demonstrate that this function correctly handles lists with numbers that are not all the same or all the different, and that the function will return True when passed to the test case with a list of numbers that have been rescaled.
