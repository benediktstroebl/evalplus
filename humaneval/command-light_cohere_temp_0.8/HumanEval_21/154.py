    Parameters: List[float] - A list of numbers.

    Returns: List[float] - The list of numbers after the linear transformation
    """
    numbers.append(0.0)
    recalculate the core numbers in the list:
        for num in numbers:
            num = 1.0 + num
            if num < 1:
                num = 1.0 / num
            else:
                num = 0.0 / num

            return numbers
```
This Python code defines a function rescale_to_unit that applies a linear transformation to a given list of numbers, ensuring that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. The function achieves this by first adding 1.0 to each number in the list and then performs the transformation only on positive numbers, setting negative numbers to their multiplicative inverse. The returned list represents the list of numbers after the linear transformation has been applied.
