Here's the solution that you are looking for:
```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    return [num / min(numbers) for num in numbers] if len(numbers) >= 2 else numbers]
```

The function rescale_to_unit takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with the numbers scaled to the range [0, 1]. The function first checks if the length of the input list is at least two. If it is, it returns the input list as is. Otherwise, the function applies the minimum value in the list divided by each number and returns the result as a new list.
