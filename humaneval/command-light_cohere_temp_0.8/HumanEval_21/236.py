```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1.
    numbers = [x / max(numbers) for x in numbers if x < 0)
    numbers = [x if x >= 1 else x * 2 - 1 for x in numbers]
    return numbers
```
The given function takes a list of numbers as an argument. It first checks if the important list has at least two elements, then it applies a linear transformation to each number in the list to ensure that all numbers are non-negative. The smallest number is transformed into 0, and the largest number becomes 1.
