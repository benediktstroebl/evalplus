```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    # Apply a linear transform to the input list to ensure the numbers are in the range [0, 1]
    transformed = [x * 1.0 for x in numbers] + [0.0]
    addend0

    transformed = [x + 1.0 for x in transformed] + [-1.0]
    same
    non_negative numbers in the list, as the function only works with positive numbers.
    return list(transformed)
