Here's the solution to the problem:
```python
def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    # Apply a linear transform to the numbers in the list to ensure that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1
    return [x / min(numbers) for x in numbers]
```
The `rescale_to_unit` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each number has been scaled up or down to be between 0 and 1. The function uses the minimum of the numbers in the list to calculate the new scaling factor, which is then applied to each number in the list.
