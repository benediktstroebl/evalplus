Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of scaling numbers to a unit range:

```python
def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    # Ensure at least two elements are provided
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Input list must contain at least two elements")

    # Define a transformation to scale to the unit range [0,1]
    transformation = [x / 100.0 for x in numbers] + [100.0]
   0

    # Apply the transformation to the list
    return [x * transformation for x in numbers]
```

This function applies a linear transformation to a list of numbers, ensuring the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. The transformation is a list [x / 100.0 for x in numbers] + [100.0], which scales the0 values within a unit of 100.
