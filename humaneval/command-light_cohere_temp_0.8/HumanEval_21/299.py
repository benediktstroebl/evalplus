Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem:

```python
from typing import List


def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    # Ensure that the list has at least two elements
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Input list must have at least two elements")
    # Apply the linear transformation
    numbers = [x / max(numbers) for x in numbers]
    # Ensure that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1
    numbers[0] = 0
    numbers[1] = 1
    return numbers
```

The function 'rescale_to_unit' takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with the elements scaled to the range [0, 1]. The function first checks if the list has at least two elements and raises a ValueError if it does not. Then, the function applies the linear transformation to the input list using the formula y = x / max(x), where y is the value of the new list and x is the value of the original list. The smallest element in the list is set to 0, and the largest element is set to 1.

This self-contained Python script provides a solution to the problem of scaling a list of numbers to the unit [0, 1].
