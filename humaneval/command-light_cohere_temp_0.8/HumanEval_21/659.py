```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1.

    Input:
    numbers: List[float] - List of numbers to be scaled

    Returns:
    rescaled_numbers: List[float] - List of numbers in which the smallest number is 0 and the largest is 1.
    """
    code snippet demonstrates the required to solve the problem. The function takes a input of a list of numbers and returns a new list with the same numbers, but with the smallest number set to 0 and the largest number set to 1.

For example, if the input is [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], the0.0] would the smtimes, it has been scaled so that the numbers in the list are between 0 and 1. This function is simply a linear transformation to the input list, with the transformation defined by the input.

You can use this self-contained function to solve the problem for any list of numbers. It is a test of a markdown code block that can be used to solve the problem easily.
