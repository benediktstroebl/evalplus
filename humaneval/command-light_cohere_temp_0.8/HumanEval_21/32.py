```
The provided Python script defines a function `rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float])` that performs a linear transformation on a list of numbers. The function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of the same numbers with the smallest value set to 0 and the largest value set to 1. The function is designed to pass all the tests for the function.
