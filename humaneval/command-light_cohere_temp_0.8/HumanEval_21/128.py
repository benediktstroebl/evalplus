Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List
def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    # Ensure length at least 2
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Input list should contain at least two elements")

    # Apply linear transformation
    result = numbers[0] / numbers[1]
    numbers = [result * x for x in numbers[1:]]

    return numbers
```
This script defines a function called `rescale_to_unit` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with the same elements but with values rescaled to the unit. It raises a particular error if the input list does not contain at least two elements. This function is expected output to be the numbers in the input list, scaled to the unit of the larger number.
