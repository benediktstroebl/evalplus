Here's the provided solution:

```python
from typing import List
def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    # Apply the linear transformation to the input numbers
    numbers = [num / max(numbers) for num in numbers]
    # Return the new values, with the smallest becoming 0 and the largest becoming 1
    return [0 if num <= 0 else num for num in numbers]
```

This function, named `rescale_to_unit`, takes a list of numbers as input and applies a linear transformation to that list, where the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. The function uses the specified list comprehension to achieve this and returns a new list with the numbers in the original order.

This function can be used to transform any list of numbers into a uniform range of 0 to 1. It can be particularly useful for scaling data to a specific range or for data visualization.
