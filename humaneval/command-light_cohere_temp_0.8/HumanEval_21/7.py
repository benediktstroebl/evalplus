```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    # Apply a linear transform to the list of numbers, ensuring the smallest becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1
    numbers = [x * 1.0 for x in numbers] + [0.0] * [numbers / 1.0]
   NER : Each element in the numbers list has been rescaled to fit the unit [0,1] range.
