Here's the solution to the problem you provided:
```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    # Apply a linear transformation to the input list, such that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1
    return [min(x, y) / (y - x) for x, y in zip(numbers)]

# Example usage:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5]
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5]
print(rescale_to_unit(numbers)) == [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0])

# Test case:
number_list = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(rescale_to_unit(number_list) == [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0])
# Output should be [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]

```
This script defines a function called `rescale_to_unit` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list of the same numbers scaled to the range [0, 1].]). The function uses the `min` function and the subtraction operator to apply a linear transformation to the input list, such that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1.
