Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you provided:
```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    numbers.extend(lambda x: max(x, 0) - min(x, 0)) / (max(x, 0) - min(x, 0))
    return numbers
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with the numbers scaled to the range [0, 1]. The function uses a lambda function to create a new function that takes a number as input and returns the scaled number. The lambda function ensures that the new function is evaluated for every element in the input list.
