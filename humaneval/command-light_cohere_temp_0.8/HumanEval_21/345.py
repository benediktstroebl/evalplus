Here's the provided Python script that solves the problem of scaling down a list of numbers so that the smallest value becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1:
```python
from typing import List


def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    numbers.res= [rescale(numbers, 0.0, 1.0, return)

def rescale(numbers: List[float], from: float, to: float) -> List[float]:
    """ Applies a linear transformation to a list of numbers so that the minimum becomes from and the maximum becomes to. quality.
    focus on theish smallest float (from and is the identity element), this function does nothing."""
    return numbers
```
