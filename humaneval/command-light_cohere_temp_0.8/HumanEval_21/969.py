This Python script defines a function called rescale_to_unit that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list of numbers after applying a linear transformation. The transformation ensures that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. The function is tested using the test_rescale_to_unit function. The output of the function is expected to be [0.0, 0]..0, 0.0, 0], which a standard output that the function works as expected.
