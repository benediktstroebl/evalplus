Here is a Python function that solves the problem you described: 

```python
def rescale_to_unit(numbers):
    # type: List[float]
    # Input list of numbers.
    # Check if theset a list with at least two elements
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return numbers  # error handling: return input if not enough elements

    # Initialize the output list with the input numbers
    result = numbers

    # Apply the linear transform to the input list
    result[0] = 0.0
    result[1] = 1.0

    # Apply the important linear transformation
    result = [0.0 * x + 1.0 * y]

    return result
```

The script will return the list with the applied transformation, which maps the smallest number to 0 and the largest number to 1. The function is designed to work only with lists of numbers with at least two elements.
