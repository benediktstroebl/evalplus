Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem you provided:
```python
from typing import List


def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    # Apply a linear transform to the list
    numbers = [x * 1.0 for x in numbers]
    # Make sure numbers contains at least two elements
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Input list must contain at least two elements")
    # Make sure the list is sorted in ascending order
    if not numbers[0] <= numbers[-1]:
        numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    return numbers
```
This function will return a list with the corresponding values after applying the linear transformation.
