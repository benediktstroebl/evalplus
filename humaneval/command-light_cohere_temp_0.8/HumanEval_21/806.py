Here's a solution to the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    # Conversion factor: [1.0, 0, -0.5]
    # To scale each number in the list to be in the range [0, 1]
    numbers = [x / 1.0 for x in numbers]
    return numbers
```
The function takes a list of numbers as input and applies a linear transformation to each number, such that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. The result is then returned as a new list.
