Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the given problem:
```python
def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    # Check for at least two elements in the input list
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Input list must contain at least two elements")

    # Define linear transformation parameters
    a = 1.0
    b = 1.0
   
   0
   0

    # Apply the linear transformation to the input list
    numbers = [a * x + b for x in numbers]

    return numbers
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list of numbers after applying a linear transformation. The linear transformation is defined by two parameters a and b, which are multiplied to each element in the input list. The function also includes input validation to ensure that the input list contains at least two elements.
