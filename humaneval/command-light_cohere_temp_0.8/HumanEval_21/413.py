    if numbers[0] < numbers[1]:
        numbers[0], numbers[1] = numbers[1], numbers[0]

```
The function `rescale_to_unit` takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with the same numbers after applying the linear transform. It raises a ValueError with the error message if the list does not have at least two elements.
