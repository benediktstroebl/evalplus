Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you described:
```python
def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    # Ensure the list has at least 2 elements
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Input list must contain at least two elements")

    # Apply the linear transform
    numbers[0] = max(0, numbers[0])
    numbers[1] = min(1, numbers[1])
    return numbers
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a modified version of the input list where the smallest number is set to 0 and the largest number is set to 1. The function raises a ValueError if the input list does not have at least two elements.
