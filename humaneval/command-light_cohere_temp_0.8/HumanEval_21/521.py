Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem:

```python
from typing import List


def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1.
    
    numbers = [x[float] for i in numbers:
        if numbers[i] < 0:
            numbers[i] = (-numbers[i]) * 10**4  # multiply by 10^4 to bring to positive values
        else:
            numbers[i] = numbers[i]  # leave negative numbers unchanged

    return numbers
```

This function first checks if any element in the input list is negative. If it is, it multiplies that element by 10 raised to the power of 4, effectively moving the negative number to the positive side of the number line. If the number is already non-negative, it leaves the number unchanged.
