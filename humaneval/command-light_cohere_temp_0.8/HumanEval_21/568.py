```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    # Apply a linear transform to the list of numbers, ensuring the smallest number is 0 and the largest is 1
    numbers[0] = 0 if numbers[0] < 0
    numbers[0] = 1.0 if numbers[0] > 0
    numbers[1] = 0 if numbers[1] < 0
    numbers[1] = 1.0 if numbers[1] > 0
    return numbers
```
This Python code defines a function called `rescale_to_unit` that performs a linear transformation on a list of numbers. The function takes a input as a list of floating-point numbers and returns a new list with the same numbers but scaled to the range [0, 1]. The function uses conditional assignments to adjust the smallest and largest numbers to be 0 and 1, respectively, before applying the transformation. The output of this function is a list of numbers that have been scaled to the desired range. 

This approach ensures that the function maintains the input range of the input and provides a consistent result for different inputs.
