Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem:

```python
def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]):
    # Apply a linear transform to that list, such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
    result = [x / numbers[0] for x in numbers]
    return result
```

The function takes a list of numbers as input and applies a linear transform to that list, such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1. The function then returns the necessary list of rescaled numbers.

This function solves the problem of applying a linear transformation to a list of numbers to ensure that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest number becomes 1, within the context of the given markdown code block.
