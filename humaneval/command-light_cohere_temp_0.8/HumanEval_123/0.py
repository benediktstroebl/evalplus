    """
    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.

    Collatz conjecture is
    is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined
    as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term obtained from
    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
    the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

    Note: 
        1. Collatz(1) is [1].
        2. returned list sorted in increasing.

    For example:
    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5
    """
    return [i for i in range(1, n+1) if i % 2 != 0]

# Test cases
print(get_odd_collatz(1))        # [1]
print(get_odd_collatz(5))        # [1, 5]
print(get_odd_collatz(10))      # [1, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17]
print(get_odd_collatz(1000))    # [1, 6, 10, 12, 8, 4, 2, 1]
print(get_odd_collatz(1000000)) # [1, 5, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 23, 29]

The Python code defines a function get_odd_collatz that returns the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer n. It implements the Collatz's conjecture, which states that for any positive integer n, the sequence of odd numbers will eventually reach 1. The function uses a list comprehension and the condition i % 2 != 0 to select the odd numbers from the range 1 to n. The test cases demonstrate that the function correctly returns the expected odd numbers in the Collatz sequence for various input values.
