This script defines a function exchange that checks whether it is possible to make all elements of a list lst1 even by exchanging elements with another list lst2. It then tests the example cases and verifies the function's correctness. The test cases include various combinations of lists with even and odd numbers, and the function correctly determines whether it is possible to make the even. Finally, the script passes all test cases and confirms that the function works correctly.
