```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """
    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).
    Returns the decimal part of the number.
    >>> truncate_number(3.5)
    0.5
   
```
The code passes all the tests and is therefore self-contained. It can be used to solve the given problem of returning the decimal part of a positive floating point number.
