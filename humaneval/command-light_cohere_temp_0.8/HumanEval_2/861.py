```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number
    >>> truncate_number(3.5) == 0.25
   5 minimum_ the outcomes.  """example:  0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5


This function can be useful in markdown code blocks to create self-contained functions and solve the problem of returning the decimal part of the number.
