```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number
    >>> truncate_number(3.5)
    print(f)
    """ 

This function is designed to handle positive numbers and decompose them into an integer part and a decimal part. 

You can use this function to extract the decimal part from any positive floating point number.
