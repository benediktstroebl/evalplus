    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals

    integer is 3, the largest integer less than 3.5 is 3, and the decimal part is 5-0.
    >>> truncate_number(0.000f(4.5) == 0.5
    integer is can 1, the largest integer less than 0.5 is 1, and the decimal part is 5-2.

    the largest integer less than it will be the smallest integer.

    The decimal part of 5.5 is 5.5- this whole return of any number with a fractional part greater than 1.

    Returns: same answer.
