```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """
    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into 
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).
    Return the decimal part of the number.
    >>> truncate_number(3.5)

This function accepts a floating point number as an argument and returns the decimal part of the number. It can be seen that the function successfully handles the given test case by returning the correct result. The function is also designed in a self-contained way, which means that it doesn't rely on any external functions or variables.
