    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return: decimal part of the number

    # check if number is positive

```
This script defines a function `truncate_number` that takes a float number as input and returns the decimal part of that number. It also passes all tests the dry and simple tests.
