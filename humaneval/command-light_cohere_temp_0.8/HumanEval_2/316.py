Here's the Python code:
```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """
    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return: decimal part of the number.
    >>> truncate_number(3.5) == 0.25
   
   eee digits.
    """ decimal part of floating-point numbers
    """

The function uses the math.math fact that all positive number can be expressed as an infinite decimal, and its decimal part is always less than 1. 

The function returns the decimal part of the number.

Note: Please ensure the parentheses are correct.
