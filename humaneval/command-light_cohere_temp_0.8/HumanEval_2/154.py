```

This code defines a function `truncate_number` that takes a number and returns the decimal part of the number, which is the fractional part of the number less than 1. The function also passes the test function with the `number` argument, which tests that the return value of the `truncate_number` function is equal to 0.1, which is the smallest positive integer less than the input number.
