```python

    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into 
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number.

This script defines a function called `truncate_number` that takes a float number as an argument and returns the decimal part of that number. 

This function is designed to be a self-contained solution, meaning that it can be run independently and does not rely on any other code or functions. 

This function passes the tests provided in the question, and returns the expected results.
