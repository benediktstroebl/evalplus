```python
def truncate_number(n: float) -> float:
    """
    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into 
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals. 
    Return the the general decimal part of the number.
    >>> truncate_number(3.5) == 0.3
   0.5? topped with a blurb! read- Python documentation is much less work to write.
    """ instead of writing the specific values for `n` variable. 
This function is self-contained, meaning that it can be run from outside without requiring additional import statements.
