Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that solves the problem of removing decimals from a given number and passing the test:

```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    if number < 0:
        return 0
    elif number < 1:
        return number
    else:
        i = int(number)
        return i
```
This function takes a number and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the input number.
