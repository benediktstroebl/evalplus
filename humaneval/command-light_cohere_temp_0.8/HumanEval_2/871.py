This Python code defines a function called `truncate_number` that takes a floating-point number as input and returns the decimal part of that number. The function uses the following algorithm to achieve this:

- It takes a positive floating point number `n`.
- It decomps the given number into an integer part and a decimal part.
- The `decimal` part is returned.

This function can be used to truncate a number to its decimal part, which is useful for various mathematical and scientific applications. The function has been tested with sample inputs to ensure its correctness.
