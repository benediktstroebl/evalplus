Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function to solve the problem:

```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """
    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).
    >>> import math
   >>> math.floor(3.5) -0
     #.5
   
   
    """
      Return:
    3
```

This Python function `truncate_number` takes a single argument `number` which is a floating point number and returns the integer part of that number. The function uses the `math.floor()` function from the access to the largest integer less than the input number, and returns the result.

This function can be used to remove the decimal part of any positive floating point number.
