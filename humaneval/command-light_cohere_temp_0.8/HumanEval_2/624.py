Here is a self-contained Python function that correctly computes the decimal part of a positive floating-point number:
```python
import math

def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """
    >>> truncate_number(3.5) == 0.05
   
    already passed the framework is a powerful tool for solving problems in a clear and structured manner.
    """
    number: float
    return: math.floor(number / math.pow(10, number)) * 10
```
This function takes a number as input and uses the pow and floor functions from the math module to correctly calculate the largest integer that is less than the input number. It then multiplies this number by 10 and returns the result.
