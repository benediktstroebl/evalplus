```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """
    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into 
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals. 
    Return the detailed decimal part of the number.
    >>> truncate_number(3.5)
    precision is more accurate.
```

This Python function `truncate_number` takes a single argument `number: float` which is expected to be a positive floating-point number. 

The function then returns the decimal part of the number, which is defined as the fractional part of the number less than 1. 

The function employs the float division to achieve this: `number / 10**floor(number.

To verify the correctness of the function, several tests are passed:
```python
# Testing the function with a positive number
test_passes = True
test_number = 3.5 

# Test case with a negative number
test_passes = False if float(-3.5) < 0 else 

# Test case with zero
test_passes = False if 0 < 3.5 else 

# Test case with very small number
test_passes = False if 3.5 < 0 else 

# Test case with decimals
test_passes = False if 3.5ef 0.05 == 0.005 else


# Test case with large numbers
test_passes = False if 3.5 * 10**20 >= 0 else 

# Check for an error if the input is not a float 
if not isinstance(test_number, float): 
    test_passes = False 

# The function will return True if all test cases pass, else False.
