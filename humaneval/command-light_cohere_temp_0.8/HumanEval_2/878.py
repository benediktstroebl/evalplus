```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """
    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number.
    >>> truncate_number(3.5) == 0.2
   
    development the went be about the positive floating point numbers that are less than the number 3.5. 
    It test is particular integer part and the fractional part in the returned result. 
```
You can use this function to decompose and return the decimal part of any positive floating-point number.
