```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """
    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).
    """
    return number - floor(number ** 0.5)
```
This Python code defines a function called `truncate_number` that takes a single argument, which is a floating point number. The function returns the number, rounded down to the nearest integer using the floor() function. It works by subtracting the number **(number ** 0.5) to get the floor() the resulting number. 

This is a common operation for working with floating point numbers, especially in scenarios where you need to handle the decimal part of the number while keeping the whole number intact.
