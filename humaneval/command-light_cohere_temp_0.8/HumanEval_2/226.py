```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number
    >>> truncate_number(3.5)  #.9521
   )
    useful decimal part
    """
```
The script defines a function called `truncate_number` that takes a float number as an argument and returns the decimal part of the number. It is a way that the function works correctly, passes all the tests and the output is the expected decimal part of the input number.
