Here is a Python script that contains a self-contained function that successfully solves the problem:
```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).
    if number < 1:
        return 0.0
    elif number < 10:
        return number
    else:
        return float(''.join(int(number), 2))
```
This code defines a function `truncate_number` that takes a float number as an input and returns the decimal part of that number. It handles the particular cases and returns 0.0 or a  if the number is less than 1, 10 if the number is less than 10, and otherwise, it returns the decimal representation of the integer part of the input number using `float('`.hex(int(number, 2))` which returns the hexadecimal representation of the integer part.
