```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """
    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number.

This code defines a function called `truncate_number` that takes a number and returns the decimal part of the number. It uses Python's particular style of docstrings that are not wrapped in a function, and the `>>>` syntax to include them in the output of the function.

This function takes a number as an argument and returns the decimal part of that number, which is the fractional part of the number less than 1.
