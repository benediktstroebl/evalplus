```python

    """
    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).
    return: float(int(n) for n in str(number) if int(n) != float('inf') and n != float('-inf'))
    return number - sum(map(float, str(number).split('.'split('.')))
