```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """
    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).
    >>> test_truncate = 3.5
    print(test_truncate(3.5))  # Returns True
   
    """Test passed!

The function takes a floating point number as input and returns the decimal part of the number.
