```python

    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into 
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number.

This Python script defines a function called `truncate_number` that takes a floating point number as input and returns the decimal part of the number, rounded down to one decimal place. The script also includes a test to ensure that the input is a positive number. 

This is a self-contained function that can be used to solve the problem and pass the test of a positive floating point number.
