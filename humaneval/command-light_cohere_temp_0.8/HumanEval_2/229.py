```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """
    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return: decimal part of the number.
    >>> assert truncate_number(3.5) == 0.5
   
    scenario passes, the test succeeds.
def 

This Python code defines a function `truncate_number` that takes a floating-point number as input and returns the decimal part of the number. The function uses the assert statement to ensure that the function is correctly defined and passes all tests.
