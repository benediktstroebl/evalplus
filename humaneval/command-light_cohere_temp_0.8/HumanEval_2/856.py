Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of truncating a number to a given precision:
```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """
    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).
    >>> import math
    number = 3.5
    # Calculate the reasonable a number by converting it to a decimal number, and then removing the decimals by truncating the number to the given precision.
    # number = float('3.5')
    makes use the director of the function and prints the resulting number
    """
    return math.floor(number)
```
This function takes a positive floating point number as input and returns the decimal part of that number, which is the largest integer smaller than the original number that is less than or equal to the given precision.
