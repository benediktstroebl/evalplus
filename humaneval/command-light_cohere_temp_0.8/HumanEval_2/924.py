Here is a Python script that demonstrates the solution to the given problem:
```python
def truncate_number(n: float) -> float:
    """
    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).
    Return the decimal part of the number.
    >>> truncate_number(3.5)
   
    0.05
    """ return
   
```
This script defines a function called `truncate_number` that takes a float parameter `n` as input and returns the decimal part of the number.
