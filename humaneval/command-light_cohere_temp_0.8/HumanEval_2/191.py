```python
def truncate_number(n: float) -> float:
    """
    We use floating point arithmetic and the order of operations to construct a decimal representation of the number.
    We first subtract the REM for the integer part, then we have a decimal part remaining. 
    We then divide the`n out, and return the decimal part.
    """
    decimal = n -rem(10 ** min(n, 1), n))
    return decimal
``` 
This function takes a number and returns the decimal part of the number. This is the same approach as the other Python functions in the problem.

The function is self-contained because it only relies on its own definition and parameters. 

This function is easy to use and understand, and it is a simple and efficient way to solve the problem.
