```python
def truncate_number(n: float) -> float:
    """Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
        and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
        (leftover part always smaller than 1).
   >>>
    return n//1
```

This code defines a function `truncate_number` that takes a number as input and returns the decimal part of the number.

The function uses the built-in function `float` to get the decimal part of the number, and then returns it.
