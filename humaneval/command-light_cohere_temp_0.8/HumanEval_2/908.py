```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    return max(number - x for x in range(1, number))
```
This Python code defines a function `truncate_number` that takes a single parameter `number: float` representing a positive floating point number. The function aims to return the decimal part of the input number, which is calculated as the difference between the input number and the largest integer smaller than the given number. 

The function uses a list comprehension with the range function to generate such integers, and then uses the `max` function to find the maximum of the differences. This maximum difference is maximum difference is effectively the decimal part of the input number, which is returned by the `truncate_number` function.
