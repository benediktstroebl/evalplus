```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
        and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
        (leftover part always smaller than 1).
    Returns the decimal part of the number."""
    integer = float('inf')
    
    while number > 1:
        if number % 10 != 0:
            number //= number % 10
        else:
            integer = number // 10
        number = number // 10
    return integer + (number < 1)
```
This code defines a function `truncate_number` which returns the decimal part of a positive number. 
It achieves this by first extracting the integer part and then returns the integer part plus a flag indicating that the number is less than 1.
