Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you described:

```python
def truncate_number(n: float) -> float:
    """
    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).
    """
    if n < 0:
        return 0.0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0.5
    elif n < 10:
        return 1.0 + n -else:
        if n < 0.25:
            return n
        else:
            return int(n) + 1.0
```
This function takes a positive floating point number and returns the decimal part of that number, which is the largest integer that is less than the given number.
