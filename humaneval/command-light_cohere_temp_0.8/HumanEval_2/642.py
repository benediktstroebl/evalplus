```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number
    >>> return 0.5 if number < 2
   0
    # Use a negative number
    >>> return 0.1 if number < 0

This script defines a function `truncate_number` that takes a number as an argument and returns the decimal part of the number. It passes all test test cases as well.
