```python
def truncate_number(n):
    # Decompose the number into its integer part and decimal part
    i = n // 1
    dec = n % 1
    # Return the decimal part
    return dec
```
This code defines a function `truncate_number` that takes a number `n` as input and returns the decimal part of the number. 
The function uses the following algorithm:
1. Convert the number to a fraction by dividing it by 1.
2 Subtract 1 to get the integer part of the fraction.
3 Calculate the remainder by dividing the number by 1 and taking the modulo of the result with 1.
4 Return the remainder as the decimal part of the number.

This code follows the concept of truncating a number to its decimal part. It can be used to solve the given problem by passing a positive floating point number as an argument.
