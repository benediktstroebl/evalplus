    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return: The decimal part of the number.
    >>> return 0.2**10** if the supports the documentable docstrings, so a docstring itself is returned.

    Test cases:
    >>> test_cases = [

        (3, 0),
        (10, 3),
