Here's the solution:

def truncate_number(n):
    """ Truncates a positive floating point number to the decimal part of its decimal representation.

    :
    The Python version that uses the decimal module is recommended.
    # Example way to achieve this:
    # We can split the number into integer and decimal parts using float_part()
    # But float_part() returns float object, and we need to convert it to a integer before return
    # Therefore, we can do it by int() built-in function
    # However, we should ignore the negative part of the integer (as a negative number will have a decimal part smaller than or equal to 1).
    # So, we can use the `isdigit()` method.
    integer = int(n)
    decimal = n - integer
    return decimal

# Example usage:
print(truncate_number(3.5))  # Output: 0.5
print(truncate_number(-0.0))  # Output: 0.0
print(truncate_number('1e'))  # This is invalid input, should throw an error

This Python function, `truncate_number`, takes a single argument `n` which is expected to be a positive floating-point number. It returns the truncates the function by returning the decimal part of the number.

This is just one way to solve the problem, but there are other ways that could be more efficient or more concise.  You need that be creative and find other solutions!
