```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """
    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into 
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals.
    Return the value of the integer part of the number.
    >>> truncate_number(3.5)  #.0
   
    first, and the integer part of 3.5 is 2
    return 0.5, which satisfies the number of the given test.
