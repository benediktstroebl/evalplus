This script defines a function called `truncate_number` that decomposes a given positive floating point number into its integer part and decimal part. The function returns the number of the decimal part of the number. The function is also tested to pass the following test cases:

- It returns 0.5 for the number 3.5.
- It returns 0.9 for the number equal 1 (since 1 is not a positive float number).
- It returns the original number for any other case where the number is not a positive float or it cannot be converted to an integer.

This code is a good example of a self-contained Python script that can be used to solve a problem and pass corresponding tests.
