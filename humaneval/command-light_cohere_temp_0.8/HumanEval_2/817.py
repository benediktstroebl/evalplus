```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number
    >>> truncate_number(3.5) == 0.95
   
    another test aanother number. 

    test that returns the simple floating point numbers can be represented as strings, but it's generally recommended to represent them as floating point numbers.

    For instance, the following code is a straightforward Python interpreter that uses the 'truncate_number' function. The function accepts a simple floating point numbers as inputs and returns the decimal portion of those numbers. It makes use of the strings as inputs and outputs floating point numbers.
