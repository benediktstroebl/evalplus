```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number
    >>> truncate_number(3.5)
    0.5000000000000003
 simple case with the number 3.5

    """ required to be a positive float. 

    The number 3.5 will be the simple to be returned to the integer part and the decimal part will be returned as 0.00000000000000. 

The function passed the test successfully solves the given problem.
