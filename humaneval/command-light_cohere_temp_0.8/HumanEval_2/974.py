```python

    """
    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number.

This Python function, `truncate_number`, takes a single argument, `number: float`, which is a positive floating point number. It then returns the value, which is the decimal part of the input number.

The function is designed to be self-contained, meaning it does not require any external functions or variables to be defined in the function. It can be easily to pass the test of a correct function by simply calling it and checking if the returned value is equal to the expected decimal part of a positive floating point number.
