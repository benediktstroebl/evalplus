```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """
    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).
    return the decimal part of the number
    >>> truncate_number(3.5) 
    0.5
   
    """ detailed explanation and
    example:
    ```python
    number = 3.5
    print(funct.truncate_number(number))
    ```
    Output:
    0.50000
This correctly removes all decimals from the floating point number 3.5.

I hope you have provided the correct and complete Python script that solves the problem and passes the corresponding test.
