This Python script defines a function `truncate_number` that returns the decimal part of a given positive floating point number. It employs the mathematical formula to achieve this, where the decimal part is the difference between the original number and its floor division by the smallest integer. The function successfully passes all test cases and can be used to calculate and retrieve the decimal part of numbers.
