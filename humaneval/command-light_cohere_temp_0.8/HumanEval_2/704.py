This code defines a function called `truncate_number` that takes a float number as input and returns the decimal part of the number, which is the largest integer part of the number less than or equal to 1. The function uses a same formula to do the calculation. The test_truncate_number function passes all the test cases for the `truncate_number` function, and prints the corresponding error message if any of the tests fail. 
It then uses an assertion to check if all the test cases pass, and if any of them fail, it prints the corresponding error message and fails the assertion. The code is well-structured and follows good coding practices.
