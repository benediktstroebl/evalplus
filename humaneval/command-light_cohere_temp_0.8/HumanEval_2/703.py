Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you described:
```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    if number < 0:  # Make sure the input is positive
        return 0.0
    elif number <= 1:  # Handle special case
        return number
    else:
        return number // 10
```
This function takes a positive floating point number as input and returns the decimal part of the number. It works by first checking if the input is less than 0, in which case it returns 0.0, since the decimal representation of negative numbers involves a leading negative sign. If the number is 1 or greater, it checks for the special case where the number is 1 or less than 1. In these cases, the function simply returns the number as is. If the number is greater than 1, it divides the number by 10 to get the integer part of the decimal representation and returns the result.
