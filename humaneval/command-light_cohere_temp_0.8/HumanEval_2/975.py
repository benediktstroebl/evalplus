```python
def truncate_number(n):
    return n < 3 and n + 1 or n ** .5 if n > 3
```
This function takes a number `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is less than 3 and can be represented as a single digit, and `False` otherwise. It uses the first approach to check if `n` is of single-digit value by using the expression `n < 3 and n + 1`. If the condition is met, the function returns `True` as it will represent `n` as the single-digit.  If also checks if `n` is greater than 3, in which case it will return `n ** .5``, which is the largest integer less than `n` that can be represented with a single-digit number.
