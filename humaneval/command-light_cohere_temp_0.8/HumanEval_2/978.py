```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """
    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into 
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1). 
    Return the decimal part of the number.
    >>> assert truncate_number(3.5) == 0.5

The script is well-structured and contains a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the test cases. It effectively decom the \ `assert` statement is used to check if the function `truncate_number` returns the expected result for the given input.
