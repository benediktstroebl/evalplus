```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """
    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into 
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals. 
    Returns the core part of the number
    >>> truncate_number(3.5) == 0.25
   , and passes a simple float test.
    """

This is a simple and efficient way to solve the problem, and the function can be easily reused with different numbers to be passed as the parameter number.
