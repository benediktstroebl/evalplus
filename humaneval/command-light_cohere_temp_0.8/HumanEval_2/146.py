Here's the solution to the provided markdown code block:

```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """
    >>> truncate_number(3.5) == 0.0
   
   
   
    another number.
    >>> truncate_number(-5.6) == -0.0
   
    fact, negative numbers can be decomposed into an integer and a fractional part that's always smaller than 1.

    If we can use the integer part of the number and make the number smaller than one, we can always return the integer part.

    """
    floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    an integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number
    """
    number = float(number)  # Convert the input string to a floating point number
    if number < 1:
        return number
    return 0.0  #No decimal point is needed for numbers less than 1
```

This code defines a function called `truncate_number` that takes a number as input and returns the decimal part of the number. The function works by converting the input to a floating point number, and then checking if the number is less than 1. If so, it returns the number as is, otherwise it returns 0.0, which is the decimal point is not needed for numbers less than 1.
