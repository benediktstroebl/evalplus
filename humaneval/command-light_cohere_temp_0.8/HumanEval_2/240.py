```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """
    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into 
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals. 
    Return the infinite decimal part of the number
    >>> truncate_number(3.5)
    0.0120
    if thege number(3.5) is to return
    decimal part of 3.5, which is less than 0.5 because 
    the decimal part of 3.5 is less than integer than 0.5, and the special value is 0.0120. 

    value returned as the served correctly and the test 
    passes.
