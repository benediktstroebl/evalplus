```python
def truncate_number(n):
    return n if n.isdigit() else n.isalpha()
 if n.isdigit() and 1 <= int(n) <= 9:
        return int(n)
    else:
        return 1.isdigit() andn float(n) <= 1
```
This function takes a number `n` as input and checks whether it's a digit or not. If it's a digit, it returns the corresponding integer part. If it's not a digit but is a letter, it returns 1 if the letter is a digit less than or equal to one, and otherwise returns False.

This function is self-contained, meaning it doesn't need to access any other modules, files, or external functions. It can be used within the script and doesn't depend on any other code.
