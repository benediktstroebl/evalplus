Here's the self-contained Python function to solve the problem:
```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """
    >>> float('3.5')
   
   
    Integer part: 3
    Decimal part: 0.5
    """
```
The function takes a number as input and returns the integer part and the decimal part of the number, respectively.

This function can be used to easily extract the integer and decimal parts from any given positive floating point number.
