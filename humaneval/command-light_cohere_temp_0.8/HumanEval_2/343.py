Here's a self-contained Python script that defines a function `truncate_number` that solves the problem you provided:
```python
def truncate_number(n):
    # Assertion to ensure the input is a positive floating point number
    assert n >= 0 and n <= 1, "Input must be a positive floating point number"
    
    # Using the floor division to get the largest integer part of the number
    return n // 1
```

The provided function takes a single parameter `n` which represents the input number. It performs some assertion to ensure that the input is a positive floating point number, and if not, it raises an error with a descriptive message.

The function then uses the floor division (`//`) operator to get the largest integer part of the number. The function returns the value of the number with the decimal part removed.
