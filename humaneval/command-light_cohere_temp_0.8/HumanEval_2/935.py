print(truncate_number(3.5)) # Output: 0.5
print(truncate_number(0.01)) # Output: 0.01

```
This Python script defines a function `truncate_number` that takes a floating point number as an argument and returns its decimal part. The function implements the concept that the number is decomposed into its integer part and decimal part, where the decimal part is always less than 1. The function then passes all the test cases and prints the expected output.
