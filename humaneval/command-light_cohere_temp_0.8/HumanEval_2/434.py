```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number.
    number = number  # set decimal part to 0
    return number - (number // 10**9) * 10**9
```
This code defines a function `truncate_number` that takes a float number as input and returns the decimal part of that number. The function works by setting the decimal part of the number to 0 and returning the number minus the decimal part divided by 10 raised to the power of 9. This ensures that the result is always within 1e-19, which is the largest representable decimal number.
