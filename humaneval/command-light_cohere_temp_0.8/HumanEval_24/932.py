Here's the improved solution:
```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    return n if n < 2 else n // 1
```
The function directly returns the largest integer less than or equal to n, that divides it without any remainder. 
This optimized solution eliminates unnecessary checks and provides a more streamlined code structure.
