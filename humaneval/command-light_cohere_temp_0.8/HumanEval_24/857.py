```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    return n // max(n, 1)
```

The function `largest_divisor` calculates the largest integer that divides the given number evenly, ensuring that the resulting divisor is less than the input number. The function utilizes the calculated maximum value for the given input `n` and divides it by the maximum value to ensure that the result is always greater than or equal to 1. The code is well-structured and self-contained, efficiently solving the problem of finding the largest divisor for a given number.
