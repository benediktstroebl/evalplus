```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    return n // max(x for x in range(1, n+1) if x % n == 0)
``` 
This function returns the largest integer that divides the number n evenly, ensuring that the result is always greater than or equal to 0. The function uses the optimized algorithm to find the largest divisor efficiently.
