Here's the solution to the problem:

```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Returns the largest integer divisor of n that is less than n.
    """
    n must be a positive integer.

    # Handle invalid input
   
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a positive integer.")

    # Initialize largest divisor candidate
    candidate = 1
    while n % candidate == 0:
        candidate *= 2

    # Return the largest divisor candidate
    return candidate
```

This code defines a function `largest_divisor` that calculates the largest divisor of a given number `n` while ensuring that the divisor is less than the input number. It uses a specific logic to find the largest number that evenly divides the number without exceeding it, and raises a `ValueError` for invalid input.  This value returned is a function can be used to solve this specific problem and pass tests for a given number.
