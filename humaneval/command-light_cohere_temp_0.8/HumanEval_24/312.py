```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    return next((d for d in range(1, n+1) if all(d == i for i in enumerate(fractions(n))))
    # This returns the first element of the largest factor set.
defractions = [i for i in range(1,int(n**.5)+1)]
``` 
This function efficiently calculates the largest divisor for a given number 'n' by using a generator expression and the `all` function. The `fractions` list contains the elements of all the factors of 'n', which are the numbers that divide 'n' evenly. The `range` function generates all integers from 1 up to the square root of 'n', and the `all` function is used to check if each number in the range is a factor of 'n'.
