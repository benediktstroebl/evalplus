```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    return next((d for d in range(1, n+1) if n % d == 0))
```
The code defines a Python function called largest_divisor that takes an integer n as input and returns the largest integer that evenly divides n, ensuring it's less than n. It employs the process of iterating through numbers from 1 to n, checking if the modulo operation n % d is equal to zero. It then returns the coverage for the longest such divisor, satisfying the problem's requirements.
