```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    return next((d for d in range(1, n+1) if not_integer_divisors(n, d))) or n

def not_integer_divisors(n: int, d: int) -> bool:
    return (d > 0 and n % d == 0 and d != n) or (d == 0 and n == 0)

def not_integer_divisors_test(n: int) -> None:
    return not largest_divisor(n) is n
```

This code defines a function called `largest_divisor` that returns the largest divisor of a given number `n`. The function uses a list comprehension to find the largest divisor less than `n` from numbers 1 to `n`. The function also includes two tests to ensure the function works as expected.
