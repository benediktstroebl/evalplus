```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    return (n // 2) + 1  # This approach aims to find the largest divisor less than n by always returning the dividend of dividing n by 2, ensuring the result is greater than n and a divisible by 2.
# Unit tests:
assert largest_divisor(15) == 5, "Test 1 failed"
assert largest_divisor(5) == 5, "Test 2 failed"
assert largest_divisor(10) == 5, "Test 3 failed"
assert largest_divisor(3) == 3, "Test 4 failed"
assert largest_divisor(0) == 0, "Test 5 failed"
assert largest_divisor(1) == 1, "Test 6 failed"
```
