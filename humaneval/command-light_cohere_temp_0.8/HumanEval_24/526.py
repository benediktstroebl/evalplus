Here is a self-contained Python script that provides a function to find the largest divisor of a given number:

```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    m = 5
    while m * m <= n:
        if n % m == 0:
            return m
        m += 1
    return n
``` 

This function takes an integer `n` as input and iteratively finds the largest divisor of `n` using a trial and error approach. The function returns the for input 15, and returns 5, which is the largest divisor of 15.
