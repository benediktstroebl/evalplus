```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    return n // 2 if n % 2 == 0 else n + 1
```
This function efficiently calculates the largest number that divides the given number without any remainder, specifically it returns the number two if the given number is even, and the number two plus one if it is odd.

I hope this provides a clear and self-contained solution to your problem.
