Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of finding the largest divisor of a given number:

```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Returns the largest integer dividing the number n without a remainder
    """
    return next((d for d in range(1, n + 1) if not n % d), n)
```

This script defines a function `largest_divisor(n)` that returns the largest integer dividing the number `n` without a remainder. The function uses a generator expression and the `next` function with the condition `not n % d` to find the largest divisor.  The using the other approach, it ensures that the divisor is less than the input number `n` to comply with the specification of finding the largest divisor of a number.

Note: The `range(1, n + 1)` provides a sequence starting from 1 up to the number `n`, and the `next` function with the condition `not n % d` is used to get the largest divisor.
