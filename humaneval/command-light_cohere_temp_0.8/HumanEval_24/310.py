Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of finding the largest divisor of a given number:
```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return int(math.sqrt(n))
```
This function calculates the largest integer that divides the given number `n` evenly, ensuring that the result is greater than or equal to the input number. 
It uses the `math.sqrt()` function, which computes the square root of the given number and then returns the largest integer less than `n` that is a factor of `n`.
