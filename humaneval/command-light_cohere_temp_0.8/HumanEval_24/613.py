```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    return (n//2 + 1) * 2
``` 
This code defines a function called largest_divisor that takes an integer n as input and returns the largest divisor of n. 
The logic used to find the largest divisor is to return the product of (n//2 + 1) * 2 which is the same as the largest divisor. 
Note that this logic is self-contained and does not require any additional imports or external functions.
