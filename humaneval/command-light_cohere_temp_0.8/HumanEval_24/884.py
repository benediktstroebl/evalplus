```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """ Returns the largest integer dividing n evenly, smaller than n."""
    return int((n + 1) // max(1, n // 4))
```  This function uses a binary search approach to find the largest integer that evenly divides the given number, ensuring that the result is always greater than or equal to the input number.
