```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    return (n // 2) + 1
``` 
This code defines a Python function `largest_divisor` that finds the largest divisor of a given integer `n`. It achieves this by utilizing the concept of the largest magnitude of a number which is always greater than or equal to the floor division of the number. The function returns the specific value `n // int` which is the input parameter and returns an integer value. The code is a way is self-contained, meaning it can be used standalone and does not rely on any other functions or variables from external sources.
