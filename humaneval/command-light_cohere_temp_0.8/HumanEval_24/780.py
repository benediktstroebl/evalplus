```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    return (n//2) + 1
``` 

This code defines a function `largest_divisor(n)` that returns the largest divisor of the given number n. The function uses the simple logic to find the largest divisor, which is always one more than the number divided evenly by 2. This is a optimized approach for the best performance.
