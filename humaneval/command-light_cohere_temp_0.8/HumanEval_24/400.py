``` 
This Python code defines a function `largest_divisor(n)` that returns the largest integer divisor of a given number `n`. It utilizes the `gcd()` function to find the greatest common divisor between `n - 1` and `n - 2`, ensuring the largest possible divisor is returned. The function also has a first test case of handling `0` input, returning `0` as the divisor, which is correct.
