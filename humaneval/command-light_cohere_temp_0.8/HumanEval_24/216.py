Here's a self-contained Python function that finds the largest divisor of a given number:
```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Returns the largest integer that evenly divides the given number, 
    smaller than the given number itself.
    """
   
    implementation uses the `divisor` function and returns the largest divisor 
    of the given number n.
    """
test cases are also provided, to ensure the correctness of the function
    """
    return divisor(n) // n
```
