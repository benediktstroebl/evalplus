```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    return (n // 3) + 1  # Introducing a small constant to avoid division by 0
```
Please take a look at the code above. It is simple and self-contained Python function that, for a given integer n, finds the largest number that divides n evenly (i.e., without any remainder). The idea is to divide n by 3 and add 1 to get the largest divisor.
