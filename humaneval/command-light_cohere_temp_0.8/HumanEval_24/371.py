```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    return n // 2 if n % 2 == 0 else n + 1
```
This code defines a function named largest_divisor that takes an integer n as input and aims to find the largest integer which evenly divides n. The code achieves this using the result by checking if n is even or odd, and then returns the appropriate value accordingly. 

This function can be used to find the largest divisor of any given integer, which is a fundamental concept in number theory and computation.
