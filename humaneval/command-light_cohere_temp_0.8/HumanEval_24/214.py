```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    return next((d for d in range(1, n + 1) if n % d == 0))
```
We have a function that, given a number n, returns the largest number which divides n exactly without a remainder. This is code is a direct and efficient way to find the largest divisor of n. 

This approach utilizes the list comprehension to iterate through all numbers from 1 to n and checks if the mod of n with each number is 0, indicating that it's a divisor.  The function returns the result of the next value in the list of divisors for the given number n, ensuring we always get the largest such divisor.
