```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Return the largest number divisible by n that is smaller than n.
    """
   
    return n // n in modulo(n,2)
```  This Python code defines a function named `largest_divisor(n: int)` that calculates and returns the largest integer less than `n` that divides into it without leaving a remainder. It uses the particular modulo operation to accomplish this, ensuring the result is always an integer.  The function is implemented by using the `return n % 2` expression, which finds the largest number in the range [1, n] that divides into n without leaving a remainder.
