Here is a self-contained Python function that finds the largest divisor of a given number: 

```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Return the largest divisor of the number n, 
    ensuring it is less than n to maintain divisibility.
    """
   
    loop from 2 to the square root of n, 
    and keeps taking the maximum divisor 
    until n is reached.
    """
    return n//divisor(n)
```
