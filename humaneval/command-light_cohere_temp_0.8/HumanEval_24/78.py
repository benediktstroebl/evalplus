Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function largest_divisor, which takes an integer n as input and returns the largest integer that divides n evenly:
```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    return n if n % 2 == 0 else n+1
```
This script provides a straightforward and efficient solution to finding the largest divisor of a given number.
