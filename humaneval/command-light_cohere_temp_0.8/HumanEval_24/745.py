```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Returns the largest integer which divides n exactly without a remainder.
    """
    Number theory tells us that every integer greater than 1 can be uniquely factorized into one or more integers:
    1, 
    2^1, 2^3, ..., i.e.,  n's the unique factors into 
    1 + x, x^2 + x^4 + ... + n where x varies between 1 and n-1.
   
    Find the specific value of x that satisfies this condition.
    """
    challenge is to find such
    **largest** such value of x.
