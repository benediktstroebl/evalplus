```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    return n // max(x for x in range(1, n+1) if x % n == 0)
```
This code defines a function called largest_divisor that takes an integer n as input and returns the largest integer that divides n exactly. The function achieves this by utilizing a generator expression along with the max function, which efficiently finds the largest number satisfying the condition.

This is a self-contained function with no external dependencies, and it effectively solves the problem of finding the largest divisor of a given number.
