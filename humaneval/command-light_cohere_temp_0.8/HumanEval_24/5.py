```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    return n // 2 if n % 2 == 0 else n - 1
```
This Python function, named largest_divisor, takes an integer n as input and returns the largest integer that evenly divides n. The function uses the specific logic to determine whether the number 2 or the number 1 should be returned. The function is self-contained and directly provides the solution to the problem. It uses the logic to efficiently find the largest divisor.
