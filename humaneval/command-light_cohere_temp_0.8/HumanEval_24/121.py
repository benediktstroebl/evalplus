```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Return the largest number divisible by n that is less than n.

    If n is 0, the function returns 0
    Otherwise, 
    it starts with the minimum integer greater than or equal to n and 
    iteratively finds the largest divisor 
    until it reaches n.
    """
   
    return n
