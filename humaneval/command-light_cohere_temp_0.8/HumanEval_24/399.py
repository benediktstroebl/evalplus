Here's the code for the problem you provided:
```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Finds the largest number divisor for the given number n, 
    ensuring it is less than n.
    Returns the
    largest divisor
    """
    return n // max((n - 1) // i for i from 2 to int(n ** 0.5))
```
This code defines a function that finds the largest divisor of a given number 'n', ensuring the divisor is less than 'n'.
