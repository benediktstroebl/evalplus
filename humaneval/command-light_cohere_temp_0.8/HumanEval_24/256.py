Here's a self-contained Python function that finds the largest divisor of a given number n: 

```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Return the largest number less than n, that divides n evenly
    """
    return next((d for d in range(1, n+1) if n % d == 0))
```
This function uses the next() function to create a generator that yields the numbers from 1 up to the given number n, and then returns the largest divisor of n, which will always be a number from this generator. 

This is a simple and efficient way to find the largest divisor of a number. Additionally, this method has the advantages of being able to iterate over potential divisors much faster than looping explicitly. 

You can use this function with any integer value as an input to find the largest divisor for that number.
