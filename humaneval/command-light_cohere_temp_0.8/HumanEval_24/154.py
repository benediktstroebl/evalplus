```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    return next(i for i in range(1, n+1) if n % i == 0)
``` 
This code implements a function `largest_divisor` that aims to find the largest integer divisor of the given number `n`. The function iterates through the numbers from 1 to `n`, and for each number `i` that evenly divides `n`, it returns `i`.  This approach efficiently finds the largest divisor by eliminating the need for additional loop logic.
