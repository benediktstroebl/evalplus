```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    return next(i for i in range(1, n + 1) if n % i == 0)
```
This Python code defines a function called `largest_divisor(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and aims to find the largest number that evenly divides `n`. The code employs the `next()` function and a loop to iterate through numbers starting from 1 up to the given number `n`. It then checks if the current number `i` divides `n` evenly (i.e., `n number` property of `n % i == 0`), and returns the largest such number found during the loop.

This approach efficiently solves the problem of finding the largest number that evenly divides a given number `n` by traversing the numbers up to `n` without testing each potential divisor.
