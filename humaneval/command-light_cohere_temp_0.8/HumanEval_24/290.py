```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    return n // max(n, 1)

# Test cases
assertEqual(largest_divisor(15), 5)
assertEqual(largest_divisor(27), 3)
assertEqual(largest_divisor(12), 4)
assertEqual(largest_divisor(8), 2)
assertEqual(largest_divisor(3), 1)
assertEqual(largest_divisor(-5), -5)
``` 
This script defines a function **largest_divisor** that returns the largest integer dividing the given number evenly, smaller than the number. The test cases cover a expected behavior of the function for a range of inputs. 

Let's go through the code:
1. The function uses the **f(n) = n // max(n, 1)** to calculate the largest integer dividing the number evenly, where the maximum is always the greater between the number and 1. 

2 The function first multiplies the number by the maximum, which guarantees that the result is always a factor of the number and the maximum. 

3. The result then divides the **n** by this result, which is the largest number that divides the number evenly. 

4. The function returns the **n** which is the largest number that divides **n** evenly, smaller than **n**. 
5. The test cases are then run to check the expected behavior of the function. 

The test cases cover a range of numbers, including negative numbers, and verify that the function returns the correct result for each input. 
The function uses the **assert** statement to compare the actual result with the expected result, and if they are not equal, an error will be raised.
