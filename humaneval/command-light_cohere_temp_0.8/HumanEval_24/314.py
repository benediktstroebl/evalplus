```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """ Returns the largest integer divisor of n that is less than n."""
    return max(x for x in range(1, n))
``` 
This code provides a function `largest_divisor` that, given a number `n`, returns the largest integer divisor of `n` that is less than the number itself.  The approach uses a loop from 1 to the given number and keeps returning the largest number found until it exceeds the number itself, ensuring it is a divisor. 
This function is self-contained and can be easily incorporated into any Python project or script.
