Here is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of finding the largest divisor of a given number:
```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Returns the largest number that divides the number n evenly, 
    smaller than n.
    """
    numbers that divide n evenly, smaller than n, are the divisors of n.
    The largest of these smallest numbers is returned.
 n = 20
print(largest_divisor(n)) # 4 
```
