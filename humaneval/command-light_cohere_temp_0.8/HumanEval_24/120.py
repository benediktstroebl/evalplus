Here is a Python script that includes a self-contained function `largest_divisor(n: int) -> int`, which finds the largest number that divides a given number `n` evenly, smaller than n.
```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Returns the largest divisor of n, i.ough large integers that are divisible by n
    """
    # Initialize a list of potential divisors
    candidates = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]

    # Remove the smallest element from the list (largest possible divisor is 1)
    candidates.remove(1)

    # Sort the list of potential divisors in ascending order
    sorted_candidates = sorted(candidates)

    # Search the list for the largest number divisible by n
    largest_divisor = sorted_candidates[-1]

    return largest_divisor

This function is self-contained and efficiently finds the largest divisor of a given number. It first starts by removing the smallest possible divisor (which is 1) and then sorts all the remaining potential divisors in ascending order. The last number in the list that is greater than `n` is returned.
