This code defines a function `largest_divisor` which returns the largest integer divisor of a given number `n` which is smaller than or equal to the result of the `gcd` function applied to `n` and 2.

The function then uses the property that the largest integer divisor of a number is equal to the GCD of that number divided by 2. 
The function then implements this using the `gcd` function to calculate the GCD. 

The code then includes unit tests to check the correctness of the function by passing in different values for n and verifying that the output of the `largest_divisor` function is correct for these inputs.
