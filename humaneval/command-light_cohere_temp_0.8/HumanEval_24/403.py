```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    return n // max([1] + n % [2 ** i for i in range(1, int(n**0.25) if n % i == 0])
```
This Python function, named `largest_divisor`, takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest integer that divides `n` evenly. It does this by taking the list of the first `i` positive integers less than `n` and the corresponding squares, and taking the maximum of these values. This approach ensures that the maximum number that divides `n` evenly is also a divisor of `n`, as it has no remainder. 
The function utilizes the list comprehension and the `max` function to achieve this.
