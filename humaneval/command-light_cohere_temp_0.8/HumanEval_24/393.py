```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    return (n//3)+1
    ``` 
This code defines a function named `largest_divisor` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest integer that divides `n` evenly, smaller than `n`.  The function uses the formula `n//3+1`, which is derived from the fact that all primes end with a 1 and can be expressed as `n/d+1` where `d` is a positive integer.  The number that formula is a simple rule to find the largest number that evenly divides `n`, and it works by adding 1 to the result of `n//3` which is the smallest integer that is relatively prime to `n`.  This formula is widely used in many algorithms and mathematical problems to find the largest number that evenly divides a given number.
