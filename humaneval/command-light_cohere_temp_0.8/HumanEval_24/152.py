```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    return n // 2 if n % 2 == 0 else n // 3
```

This function calculates the largest number which divides the given number n evenly, i. i always returns the's integer that guarantees that the result will be a valid integer divisor. The function works by detecting whether the number is even or odd using the modulo operator. The function then returns the number that is guaranteed to be a divisor, and is smaller than n. 

You can use this function to solve this problem in your markdown code block.
