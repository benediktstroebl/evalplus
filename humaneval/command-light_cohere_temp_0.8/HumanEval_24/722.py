Here's a self-contained Python function that finds the largest divisor of a given number n: 

```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Return the largest divisor of the number n, 
    ensuring it's less than n to maintain the integrity of the prompt problem.
    """
   
    loop from 1 to the square root of n, 
    and keeps incrementing the divisor by 1 until a 
    divisor greater than the square root is found.
    """
    return n if n<=1
    """
