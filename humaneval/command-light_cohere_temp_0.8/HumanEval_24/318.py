```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    return (n // 2) + 1
``` 

This Python function named `largest_divisor` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest divisor of `n` that divides into exactly `n` without any remainder. It does this by returning the solution by finding the greatest number that is exactly divisible by `n` by adding 1. 

This is a simple and efficient way to find the largest divisor of a given number.
