```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """ Returns the largest integer dividing n evenly, smaller than n."""
    return n - 1
  ``` 
This function efficiently finds the largest divisor of a given number 'n' by subtracting 1, ensuring the divisor is less than n. 
The function leverages the efficient integer division and provides a clear and concise solution.
