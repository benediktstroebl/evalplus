Here's the provided Python code:
```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Return the largest divisor less than n
    """
    return [d for d in range(1, n + 1) if n % d == 0]
```
This code defines a function `largest_divisor` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest integer that divides `n` evenly (without leaving a remainder). The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if the division result is zero, indicating that the number divides `n` evenly.
