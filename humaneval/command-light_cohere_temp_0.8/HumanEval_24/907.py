```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    return (n // 2) + 1
```
This Python function, largest_divisor, is designed to find the largest integer that evenly divides a given number n without a remainder. It does this by dividing n by 2 and returning the result plus 1, ensuring that the divisor is smaller than n. 

This self-contained function can be used to efficiently solve the problem of finding the largest divisor of a given number in a clear and concise manner.
