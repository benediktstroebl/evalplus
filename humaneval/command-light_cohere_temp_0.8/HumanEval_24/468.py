```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    return n // max(x for x in range(1, n+1) if x % n == 0)
```
The provided code defines a Python function called `largest_divisor`, which takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest integer that divides evenly into `n`, i.e.n.  This smilar function in terms, it works by first finding the largest number less than n that divides into n without leaving a remainder. The `range` function is used to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 up to n, and the `max` function is used to get the largest number in that sequence. The `fdiv` method is then used to get the remainder when `x` is divided by `n`. 

This function is self-contained, and it can be used to solve the problem of finding the largest divisor of a given number in a single, efficient, and concise manner.
