Here's the Python script with the self-contained function `largest_divisor(n: int) -> int` that finds the largest number that divides a given number `n` evenly:
```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Finds the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n
    Returns: The largest integer less than n that divides evenly into n.
    """
    int divide(int, int b) -> int:
        """ Divides two integers with the floor division"""
        return int(float(i)/b) * b

    """ Returns the largest integer divisible by n, smaller than n """
    return divide(n, 2)
```
