```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    return (n//2) + 1
```
This Python code defines a function called **largest_divisor** that takes an integer **n** as input and returns the largest integer that divides **n** evenly, smaller than or equal to **n**. This effectively finds the largest divisor by dividing **n** by 2 and then adding 1 to account for the remainder.

The code is well-contained and demonstrates a straightforward solution to the problem of finding the largest number that evenly divides a given number.
