This Python code defines a function called encode that takes a string message as input and returns the encoded message. The encode function utilizes string manipulation techniques to replace all vowels with the letter that appears two places ahead in the English alphabet. This helps in converting the text case, removing unnecessary characters, and creating a more readable version of the message. 

The code also includes a set of unit tests to verify the functionality of the encode function. These tests check that the expected output matches the output of the encode function for a given input string.
