```python
def encode(message):
    """
    Encodes the message as specified.
    
    :param message: str - The message to be encoded
    :return: str - The encoded message
    """
    encoding = []
    for c in message:
        if c.isalpha():  encoding.append(c)
        if c.isupper(): encoding.append(c.next())
    suppose these regular English of a character, which is its ASCII value and is thus lowercase or uppercase, so we replace the character that appears 2 places ahead of the vowel with it.
    return ''.join(encoding)
```
The above function replaces all vowels with the next letter in the English alphabet, then converts the characters into lowercase, so that the resulting string is in the format that you desire. 
This function is self-contained, as it does not rely on any other functions or modules.
