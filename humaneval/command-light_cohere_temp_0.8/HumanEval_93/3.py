```python
def encode(message):
    """
    Encodes the message such that all letters are lowercase, 
    and vowels are replaced with the next letter in the English alphabet.

    Returns the native encoded message.

    string.

    for char in message:
        if char.isalpha():
            encoding += char.isalpha()
        string.isalpha()
        Alternatively, if char.isuppercasea letter,
        if char.isalpha():
            encoding += chr(97 + (ord(char) - 32))

```

This code defines a function called encode that takes a string message as input. The code then loops through each character in the message, checking if it's an alphabet character. If it is, the code appends the character to the encoding string, if it's not, the code adds the character to the encoding string, which is the lower case version of the alphabet letter.
