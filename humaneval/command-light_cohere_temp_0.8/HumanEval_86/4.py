    Function to arrange characters of a string in ascending ASCII order and return a shuffled version of it.
    Note that this return value ensures original spaces between words.

    Parameters:
    String to be shuffled.

    Returns: Shuffled version of the input string.

print(anti_shuffle('Hi'))      # Expected Output: 'Ehllo'

```
This Python code defines a function called anti_shuffle that takes a string s as input and rearranges its characters in ascending ASCII order, returning a new string with the characters in this sorted order. The function achieves this result by iterating through each character in the input string, calculating its ASCII value, and inserting it into the result list at the appropriate position. The final shuffled string is then returned. The code also includes several test cases to demonstrate the functionality of the anti_shuffle function.
