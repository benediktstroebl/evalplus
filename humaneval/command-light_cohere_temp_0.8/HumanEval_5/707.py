```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    return [num + i * delimeter for i, num in enumerate(numbers)]

# Test case 1: Empty list
numbers = []
result = intersperse(numbers, 4)
assert len(result) == 0

# Test case 2: Single element list
numbers = [1]
result = intersperse(numbers, 4)
assert len(result) == 1

# Test case 3: List with multiple elements
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
result = intersperse(numbers, 4)
assert len(result) == 6

# Test case 4: List with repetitive elements
numbers = [1, 1, 4, 5]
result = intersperse(numbers, 4)
assert len(result) == 6
```

This script defines a function `intersperse` that takes a list of integers and a delimiter as input and returns a list of interspaced numbers. The test cases cover different scenarios, such as an empty list, a single element list, a list with multiple elements, and a list with repetitive elements. The results of the expected behavior are asserted in each case using `assert` statements.
