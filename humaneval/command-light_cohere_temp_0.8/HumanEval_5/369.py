Here's the self-contained Python function that implements the `intersperse` operation from the prompt:
```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    return [x, delimeter, x + delimeter] + numbers[1:]

# Test cases
test_data = [
    [],  # Empty list
    [1, 2, 3],  # List with elements
    [10, 20, 30],  # List with large numbers
]

test_cases = [
    lambda: intersperse(test_data, 4),  # Test empty list
    lambda: intersperse(test_data, 4),  # Test list with elements
    lambda: intersperse(test_data, 4),  # Test list with large numbers
    lambda: intersperse(test_data, 1),  # Test list with single element
]
]

for test_func, expected in test_cases:
    actual = test_func(test_data)
    print(f"Test {test_func.__name__} --> {actual}, Expected: {expected}")
```

This code defines a function `intersperse` that inserts a number `delimiter` between every two consecutive elements of the input list. It also provides a test cases with a variety of lists, and the `intersperse` function is applied to each. Finally, the test results are printed and verified against the expected values.
