```python
def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        result.append(numbers[i+1])
        result.append(delimeter)
    return result
```
The code defines a Python function called `intersperse`, which takes a list of integers `numbers` and an integer `delimiter` as input. The function iterates through the range of elements in the input list, appending each element to the `result` list, followed by the `delimiter` value. The function returns the this resulting list of integers, with the `delimiter` value inserted between every two consecutive elements.
