```
The provided Python script defines a function `inperse` that takes two arguments: a list of integers (numbers) and an integer (delimiter). The function then inserts the delimiter between every two consecutive elements in the input list, resulting in a new list with properly spaced numbers. 

The script provides several test cases to demonstrate the usage of the `inperse` function. Each test case demonstrates the-> with different inputs, the script should correctly insert the delimiter between consecutive elements, as expected.
