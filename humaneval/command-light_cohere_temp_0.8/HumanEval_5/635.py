```python
from typing import List
def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    return [num + i * delimeter for i, num in enumerate(numbers)]
# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
delimiter = 4
result = intersperse(numbers, delimiter)
print(result)  # Expected output: [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
``` 
This Python code defines a function `intersperse` that takes a list of integers and a delimiter as input. The function returns a using a list comprehension with a loop to add the result of multiplying the current number with the delimiter, and the previous number, to the list. This effectively inserts the final numbers with increased spacing between them.
