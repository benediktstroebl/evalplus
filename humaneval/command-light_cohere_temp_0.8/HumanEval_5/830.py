```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Insert a number 'delimiter' between every two consecutive elements of input list. """
   
   
    unique integers in list with a delimiter."""
    # Create list of lists with consecutive pairs of numbers
    result = []
    for i, num in enumerate(numbers):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result.append([num, delimeter])
        else:
            result.append(num)
    return result
```  This Python function, `intersperse`, is designed to take a list of integers and an integer `delimiter` as input, and return a list of integers with a `delimiter` inserted between every two consecutive elements. The function uses the numbers in the input list, and iterates through the list. In each iteration, it checks if the current element is the first element and if it's even numbered (i.e., the first element in a list of numbers). If it is, it adds the current element and the `delimeter` to the result list. Otherwise, it adds the current element to the result list.
