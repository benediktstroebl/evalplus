This Python code defines a function `intersperse` that separates consecutive elements in a list by a specified delimiter. It provides several test test cases with various input lists and different delimiter values, showcasing the functionality for different scenarios. The script passes all tests successfully, demonstrating the ability to insert a delimiter between consecutive elements in the list.
