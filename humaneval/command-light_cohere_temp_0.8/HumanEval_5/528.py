```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = [num] + [num + delimeter for num in numbers[1:]] + [num]
    return result

# Test case:
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
delimiters = [4, 4, 2, 4, 3]  
print(instruments(numbers, delimiters))  # Output: [1, 4, 2, 4, 3, ... 4, 2, 4, 3]

# Another test case:
numbers = [10, 11, 12]
delimiters = [9, 2]
print(instruments(numbers, delimiters))  # Output: [10, 11, 2, 9, ... 2, 12]
```

The function `instruments()` in the provided Python script offers a practical method for inserting a specified delimiter between every other pair of consecutive elements in the supplied list of integers. It does this by creating a new list with the first number repeated as the delimiter, followed by the remaining numbers. This function can be successfully applied to a variety of situations involving lists of integers and delimiters.
