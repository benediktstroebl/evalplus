```python
from typing import List
def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    return [num + i * delimeter for i, num in enumerate(numbers)]
numbers = [4, 1, 9, 3]
print(inpersepe(numbers, 4))  # Expected Output: [5, 9, 13, 16]
```
The provided code defines a function `intersperse` that takes a list of integers `numbers` and a delimiter `delimiter` as input. It uses a regional list comprehension to add the `delimiter` to every second element in the list. The resulting list contains the `delimiter` after each number, creating the desired effect of inserting the delimiter between every pair of consecutive elements.
