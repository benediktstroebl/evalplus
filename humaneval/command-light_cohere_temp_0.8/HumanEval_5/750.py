```python
def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    return [num + i * delimeter for i, num in enumerate(numbers)]

# Test the function with sample inputs and checks
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
delimiters = [4, 8]

result = intersperse(numbers, delimiters)
print("Result:", result)  

# Check if expected order of elements and lengths are met
nums = [list(map(int, result))
nums_expected = [1, 12, 4, 8, 12, 4, 8, 3]

for i, actual in enumerate(nums):
    if actual != nums_expected[i]:
        print(f"Error in result: Expected {nums_expected[i]}, but got {actual}")
        break
```  This Python code defines a function called **'intersperse'** that takes two parameters: a list of integers **'numbers'** and a list of integers **'delimiters'**. Inside the function, it uses a list comprehension to create a new list where each element is the sum of the original number and the corresponding delimiter multiplied by 2. This new list is the final result, the code prints the original list of numbers with the corresponding delimiters added, then compares it with the expected numbers. Finally, it checks for any discrepancies between the actual and expected numbers, and if any are found, it prints an error message indicating which expected numbers were not correctly added.
