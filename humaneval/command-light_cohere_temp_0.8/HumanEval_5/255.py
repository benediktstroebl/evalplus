```
This Python code defines a function called `inperse` that separates numbers in a list by a specified interval. It handles various test list scenarios: empty lists, lists with numbers, lists with a single number, lists with multiple consecutive numbers, and lists with negative numbers. The function uses a list comprehension and a loop to achieve this separation and returns the resulting list.
