The Python script provided defines a function `intersperse` that takes a list of integers and a delimiter as input and returns a list of integers with the given delimiter inserted between every other number. The script then provides a simple test cases to verify the functionality of the `intersperse` function, passing test numbers and expected results. The script also includes a verification function `verify` that takes a list of integers and an expected result as input and compares the actual result with the expected one, asserting the equality using the `assert` statement.  The numbers in the list are the input numbers that are supposed to be separated by the given delimiter. The expected result is the expected result after applying the `intersperse` function to the input list. The `verify` function checks that each number in the input list is equal to the expected one, and asserts this equality using the `assert` statement.
