```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Insert a number 'delimiter' between every two consecutive elements of input list
    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)
    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
    >>> intersperse([1,2,3], 'x')
    ['x', 1, 'x', 2, 'x', 3]
    """
    result = [i+delimeter for i,j in zip(numbers,numbers[1:]) for j in numbers[1:] + [delimiter]]
    return result
```  The code provided is a Python script that contains a self-contained function called `intersperse`. This function takes a list of integers as input and a delimiter as an argument. It uses a  a combination of list comprehension and the `zip` function to iterate over the input list, inserting the delimiter between every two consecutive elements.
