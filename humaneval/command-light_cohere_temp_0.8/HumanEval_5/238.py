```python
def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    return [i + j for i, j in zip(numbers, numbers[1:], delimeter)]

# Test the function with different input
numbers = [4, 2, 3, 1]
delimiter = 4
expected = [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
result = intersperse(numbers, delimiter)

# Validate the result
assert list(expected) == result, "Incorrect result: {}".format(result)
``` 
This code defines a function `intersperse` that takes a list of numbers and an integer `delimiter` as input, and returns a new list where every element from the original list is incremented by the `delimiter` with the corresponding element from the next list. 
This is essentially a way of inserting the `delimiter` between every other pair of elements in the list.
