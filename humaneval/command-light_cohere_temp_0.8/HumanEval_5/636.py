```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    return [num + i * delimeter for i, num in enumerate(numbers)]

# Test the function with various inputs
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
delimiters = [2, 3]

result = intersperse(numbers, delimiters)
print(result)

# Test with empty list
numbers = []

result = intersperse(numbers, delimiters)
print(result)

# Test with one value
numbers = [5]
delimiters = [2]

result = intersperse(numbers, delimiters)
print(result)
``` 
This code defines a function `intersperse` that takes a list of integers and a delimiter as input and returns a list of modified integers. It achieves this by adding the number multiplied by the delimiter, between every element and the corresponding index in the list.
