```python
from typing import List
def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    return [num + i * delimeter for i, num in enumerate(numbers)]

# Test the function with several cases
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(intersperse(numbers, 4))  # Expected Output: [1, 4, 2, 4, 3, 5]

numbers = [10, 2, 6, 8, 4]
print(intersperse(numbers, 4))  # Expected Output: [10, 14, 18, 12, 8, 4]

numbers = [1, 2, 3]
print(intersperse(numbers, 6))   # Expected Output: [2, 8, 6, 12, 10]

numbers = [10, 20, 30, 10, 40]
print(intersperse(numbers, 5))  # Expected Output: [15, 25, 30, 15, 35]
```
This Python function `intersperse` takes a list of integers and a delimiter as input and returns a new list with the elements of the input list spaced out using the provided delimiter. The function uses the pay attention to each element of the input list using the index `i` and adds the `delimiter` to the result. The `enumer` loop ensures that the `delimiter` is added between every two consecutive elements in the list.
