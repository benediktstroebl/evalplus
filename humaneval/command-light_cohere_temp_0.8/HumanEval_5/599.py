```python
def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    return [num + i * delimeter for i, num in enumerate(numbers)]

# Test cases
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
delimiters = [0, 4]  # Changed to use tuple for easier indexing later
result = intersperse(numbers, delimiters)

print("Test Case 1: ", end="")
for num, delimiter in zip(result, delimiters):
    print(f"{num}:", end=', ')
print()

print("Test Case 2: ", end="")
for i, num in enumerate(numbers):
    print(f"{i+1}: {num},", end=', ')
print()

print("Test Case 3: ", end="")
for i, num in enumerate(numbers):
    print(f"{delimiter} {num}", end=', ')
```
This script defines a function `intersperse` that takes a list of numbers and a delimiter as input and returns a new list where numbers are padded with the delimiter at every second or third element, depending on the length of the input list. 
The script also provides three test cases, passing the function with different lists of numbers and delimiters, and printing the output for each case.
