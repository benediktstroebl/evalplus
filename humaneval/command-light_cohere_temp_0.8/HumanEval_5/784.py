```python
from typing import List
def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    return [num + i * delimeter for i, num in enumerate(numbers)]

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    [],  # empty list
    [1, 2, 3],  # list with elements
    [10, 20, 30],  # list with large numbers
]

test_results = []

for test_case in test_cases:
    test_results.append( intersperse(test_case, 4) == test_case )

print(test_results)
``` 
This script defines a function `intersperse` that takes a list of integers and a delimiter as input and returns a list of integers with the given delimiter between every two consecutive elements. The script then creates a list of test cases and uses a loop to test the `intersperse` function with each test case. The test results are stored in the `test_results` list and finally, the results are printed to the console.
