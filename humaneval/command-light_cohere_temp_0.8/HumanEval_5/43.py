```
This Python function, `invisalign`, addresses the task of inserting a specified delimiter between every other pair of elements in a given list. It handles cases with varying list lengths, ensuring proper insertion of delimiters and preserving the original list's order. The test cases validate the major aspects of the function's behavior, including empty lists, single elements, and lists with multiple elements.
