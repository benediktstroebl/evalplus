    Returns: A list of integers with the delimiter inserted between every two

This Python script defines a function called `intersperse` that takes a list of integers and a delimiter as input and returns a list of integers with the specified delimiter inserted between every two consecutive elements. The function utilizes a array comprehension and the `zip` function to achieve this effect. 

The provided test suite confirms the expected output of the `intersperse` function for various input lists.
