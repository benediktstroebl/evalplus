The function takes a list of numbers and a delimiter as input, and returns a list of the numbers with the delimiter inserted between every two consecutive elements. The test function is used to check that the function works correctly with a variety of inputs. The test results show that the function correctly interspreads the numbers with the specified delimiter.
