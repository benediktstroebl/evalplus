```python
from typing import List
def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    return [num + delimeter for num, delimeter in zip(numbers, [delimeter] * 2)]
# Test the function with different inputs
numbers = [4, 2, 3]
delimiter = 4
result = intersperse(numbers, delimiter)
print(result)  # Expected output: [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
``` 
The code defines a function `intersperse` that takes a list of integers `numbers` and an integer `delimiter` as input. It uses a's approach to solve the problem by iterating over the input list and concatenating each element with the `delimiter` value, effectively inserting the `delimiter` between every two consecutive elements.
