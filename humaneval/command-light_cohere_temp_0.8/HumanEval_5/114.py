```python
def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    >>> intersperse([1,2,3], 2)
    [1,2,2,3]
    >>> intersperse([5,2,9,1], 1)
    [5,9,1,2,3]
    """
    result = [x for x, y in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])] + [delimeter]
    return result
```  The provided Python code defines a function called `intersperse`. This function takes two parameters: `numbers`, which is a list of integers, and `delimiter` which is also an integer. 

The `result` variable is created using a list comprehension that iterates over the `numbers` list and creates a new list by inserting the `delimiter` value between every other element of the list. This creates a  a list with the first and last elements of the original list, separated by the `delimeter` value.
