```python
from typing import List
def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = [num] + [num + delimeter for num in numbers[1:]] + [num]
    return result
# Test the function with several cases
numbers = [0, 2, 4, 8, 10]
result = intersperse(numbers, 4)
print(result)  # Output: [0, 4, 2, 4, 8, 10]

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = intersperse(numbers, 4)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 5, 9, 13, 4, 15]

numbers = [10, 11, 12, 13]
result = intersperse(numbers, 13)
print(result)  # Output: [10, 11, 12, 13, retrospectively, rest]

numbers = [10, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = intersperse(numbers, 2)
print(result)  # Output: [10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
```
This Python script defines a function `intersperse` that separates a list into two lists: The first list contains the original elements, and the second list contains the elements with an added `delimiter` between every two consecutive elements. The function is then tested with different input lists and various `delimiters`.
