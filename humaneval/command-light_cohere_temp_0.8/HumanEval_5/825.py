```python
def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for i, num in enumerate(numbers):
        result.append(num)
        result.append(delimeter)
    result.append(num)
    return result

```
This Python code defines a function called `intersperse` that takes a list of integers `numbers` and a delimiter `delimiter` as input. It uses a purpose of this function is to insert the `delimiter` between every two consecutive elements of the input list. The function returns a result which is a modified version of the input list, with the delimiter inserted between each pair of consecutive elements. The code is a way to solve the problem of inserting a delimiter between elements in a list and passes the corresponding tests.
