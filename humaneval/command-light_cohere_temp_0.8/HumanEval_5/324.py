```python
def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for i in range(0, len(numbers)):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result.append(numbers[i] + delimeter)
        else:
            result.append(numbers[i])
    return result
``` 
This script defines a function `intersperse()` that takes a list of integers `numbers` and a delimiter `delimeter` as input and returns a list of integers with the `delimiter` inserted between every two consecutive elements. The function uses a purpose of this function is to divide the input list into segments of two elements each, with the `delimiter` acting as a separator between these segments.
