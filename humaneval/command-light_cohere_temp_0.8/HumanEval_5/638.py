Here's the improved code for the markdown code block:
```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Insert a number 'delimiter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers`. 
    Returns a list with the original order of numbers, with separators.
    >>> interspersed([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 2, 3, 4]
    >>> interspersed([5, 10, 15], 5) == [5, 10, 15, 5]
    >>> interspersed([7, 8, 9], 6) == [7, 8, 9, 6, 8, 9]
    """
    return [i + delimeter if i != len(numbers) - 1 else i for i in numbers]
```  This code is self-contained and provides a function that inserts a separator value between every other consecutive element in the list, while maintaining the original list order.
