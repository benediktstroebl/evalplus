```python
from typing import List
def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for i in range(0, len(numbers)):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result.append(numbers[i])
        else:
            result.append(numbers[i]) + delimeter

    return(result)

# Test cases
numbers1 = [1, 2,3]
numbers2 = [4,8,12]
numbers3 = [1,2,7]
numbers4 = [8,9,8]

print(f"Result of {numbers1} using intersperse(): {intersperse(numbers1,2)}")
print(f"Result of {numbers2} using intersperse(): {intersperse(numbers2,2)}")
print(f"Result of {numbers3} using intersperse(): {intersperse(numbers3,2)}")
print(f"Result of {numbers4} using intersperse(): {intersperse(numbers4,2)}")
```

This script defines a function `intersperse` that inserts a delimiter number between every two consecutive elements of a list. The function is self-contained and provides corresponding test cases to demonstrate its functionality. 

I hope this was helpful!
