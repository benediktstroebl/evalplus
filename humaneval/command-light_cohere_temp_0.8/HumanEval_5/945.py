```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = [num + delimeter if i < len(numbers) - 1 else num for i, num in enumerate(numbers)]
    return result

# Test the function with a sample input and expected output
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
delimiters = [0, 4]  
expected = [1, 4, 2, 4, 3, 5]
print(f"Test passed: {expected} == {intersperse(numbers, delimiters)}")
```  This code defines a function `intersperse` that takes a list of numbers and a delimiter as input, creates a new list where consecutive numbers are separated by the given delimiter, and then returns this modified list.  The language is used to ensure type accuracy and provide better code readability and structure.
