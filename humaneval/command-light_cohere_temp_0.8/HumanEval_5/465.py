```python
def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    return [i + j for i, j in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])] + [delimeter]

# Test case 1: Basic operation
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
result = intersperse(numbers, 4)
assert len(result) == 6
assert result == [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]

# Test case 2: Empty list
numbers = []
result = intersperse(numbers, 4)
assert len(result) == 0

# Test case 3: List with one element
numbers = [1]
result = intersperse(numbers, 4)
assert len(result) == 1
assert result == [1, 4]

# Test case 4: List with two elements
numbers = [1, 2]
result = intersperse(numbers, 4)
assert len(result) == 3
assert result == [1, 4, 2]

# Test case 5: List with three elements
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
result = intersperse(numbers, 4)
assert len(result) == 6
assert result == [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
```

This Python function uses a list comprehension to insert a `delimiter` value between every other pair of elements in the input list, resulting in a new list with properly spaced elements. The test cases cover scenarios for empty lists, lists with one element, lists with two elements, and lists with three or more elements, and validate that the `result` list is as expected for each case.
