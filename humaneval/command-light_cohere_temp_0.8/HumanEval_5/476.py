```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    return [num + i * delimeter for i, num in enumerate(numbers)]

# Test cases
test_cases = [ [
    [],  # empty list
    [1, 2, 3],  # list with elements
    [10, 20, 30],  # list with large numbers
]
]

for tc in test_cases:
    actual = Intersperse(tc, 4)
    expected = [10, 14, 16, 20, 24, 28, 30]
    assert actual == expected, f"Test case {tc} failed"
``` 
The code defines a function `intersperse` that takes a list of integers and a delimiter as input and returns a list of numbers with the delimiter inserted between every two consecutive elements. The code then provides several test cases to verify the functionality of the `intersperse` function. 
The test cases include an empty list, a list with a few numbers, and a list with large numbers, and the function is expected to return the list with numbers separated by the specified delimiter.
