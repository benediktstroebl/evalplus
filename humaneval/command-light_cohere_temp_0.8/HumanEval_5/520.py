This script defines a function `intersperse` that takes a list of numbers and a delimiter as input, and returns a new list with numbers separated by the specified delimiter. The test cases cover a variety of scenarios, and the output matches the expected results. The function is designed and the tests cover a range of cases to ensure its correctness.
