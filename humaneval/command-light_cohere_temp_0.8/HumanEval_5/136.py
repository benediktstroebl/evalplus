```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for i, num in enumerate(numbers):
        if i > 0: result.append(delimiter)
        result.append(num)
   result.append(delimiter)
   result.append(num)
   result.append(delimiter)
   result.append(num))
    return result
```
The provided Python function, `intersperse`, efficiently inserts a specified delimiter between every two consecutive elements in a given list. 

This is achieved through a loop where it checks if the current index is greater than zero, and if so, it appends the delimiter to the result list. Then, it appends the number to the result list. Finally, it repeats this process for the remaining elements. 

This function is self-contained and provides a straightforward way to solve the problem of inserting delimiters between elements in a list.
