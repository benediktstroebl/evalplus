Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of inserting a specified delimiter between every other element in the list:
```python
def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimiter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = [num for num in numbers]
    while len(numbers) > 1:
        result.append(result[-1] + delimiter)
        numbers.removeat(1, numbers)
    return result
```

This function takes two parameters: `numbers`, which is the input list to be traversed, and `delimiter`, which is the value to be inserted between every other element in the list. The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list, `result`, that contains the original list elements followed by the specified delimiter. The function then removes the value at index 1 from the input list using the `removeat()` method, as the element at index 1 is the last element with the specified delimiter inserted.
