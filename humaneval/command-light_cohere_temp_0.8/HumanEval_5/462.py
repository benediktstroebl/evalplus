```python
from typing import List
def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Insert a number 'delimiter' between every two consecutive elements of the input list. """
    """ return theSince list with the interleaved numbers.
>>> [1, 2, 3]
>>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 2)
[1, 2, 2, 3]
>>> [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
>>> intersperse(list(map(int, 'abc')), 1)
[a, b, c, d, e, f]
```
The `intersperse` function takes a list of integers and a delimiter as input and returns a new list with the numbers interleaved. The `delimiter` value is inserted between every two consecutive elements in the input list. This makes the `intersperse` function useful for formatting data in a unique way.
