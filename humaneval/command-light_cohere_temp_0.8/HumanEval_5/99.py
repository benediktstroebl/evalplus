```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    return [i + j for i, j in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]) + [delimeter]]

# Test case 1
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
result = intersperse(numbers, 4)
assert list(result) == [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]

# Test case 2
numbers = [4, 5, 6]
result = intersperse(numbers, 4)
assert list(result) == [4, 4, 5, 4, 6]

# Test case 3
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
result = intersperse(numbers, 2)
assert list(result) == [1, 2, 4, 6, 3]
```
This Python code defines a function called **'intersperse'** that operates on a list of integers and inserts a specified delimiter value between every second element. The function employs a 'zip' to pair each element with the next, followed by the delimiter, resulting in the desired effect of interspersing the delimiters. The code then includes three test cases that validate the correctness of the **'intersperse'** function by comparing the result with the expected output.
