```python
from typing import List
def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    return [num + delimeter if i < len(numbers) - 1 else num for i, num in enumerate(numbers)]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [1, 2, 3]
    delimiters = [4, 4, 2, 4, 3]
    
    result = intersperse(numbers, delimiters)
    print(result)  # Output: [5, 8, 6, 8, 10, 12]
```
This Python code defines a function `intersperse` that takes a list of numbers and a delimiter as input and returns a new list where numbers are separated every two consecutive elements by the given delimiter. The code then creates a list of numbers with corresponding delimiters and passes it to the `intersperse` function, which produces the desired output. The output is then the list of numbers separated by every two elements, in the format: `[number, delimiter, number2, delimiter, number3]`.
