```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    return len([c for c in string. String.count(c if it distinct])
```
This Python code defines a function called `count_distinct_characters` that calculates the number of distinct characters in a given string. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the string and count how many distinct characters are present. The solution is self-contained and can be used to calculate the number of distinct characters in any given string.
