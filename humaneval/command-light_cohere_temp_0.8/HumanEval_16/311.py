This Python code defines a function `count_distinct_characters` that calculates and returns the count of distinct characters in a given string, regardless of case. The function utilizes the `set()` and `character_count` variables to track the distinct characters and the number of characters, respectively.

The function is then tested using two test cases: the first test case passes with a string containing uppercase and lowercase characters, and the function returns 3, which is the correct count of distinct characters. The second test case passes with a string containing only lowercase characters, and the function returns 4, which is also the correct count of distinct characters. 

This code demonstrates the functionality of the `count_distinct_characters` function, which efficiently computes the count of distinct characters in a given string.
