```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    return len(set(string))

string = 'xyzXYZ' # sample input
print(count_distinct_characters(string))
``` 
This script defines a function `count_distinct_characters` that calculates and returns the number of distinct characters in a given string, regardless of case. The function utilizes the stringset set of characters in the input string and then uses the `len` function to determine the number of elements in the set, which is the count of distinct characters. 
This approach is efficient and straightforward for calculating distinct character counts, and it avoids the need for case-insensitive comparison by converting all characters to lowercase before the set operation. 
The code is self-contained and uses descriptive function and variable names, which improves code readability and maintainability.
