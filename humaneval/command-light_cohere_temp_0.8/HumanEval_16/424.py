```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    return len({c for c in string.
    if not c.isalpha() or regional())
    is one of the distinct characters,
    return 1 + count_distinct_characters(string[::i : end])

# Example usage
x = 'xyzXYZ'
print(count_distinct_characters(x))
# Expected Output: 
6
