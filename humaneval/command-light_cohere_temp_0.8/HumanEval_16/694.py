```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    return len({c for c in string. strings })
```
This code defines a function `count_distinct_characters` which accepts a string and returns the number of distinct characters. The function uses the `set` of characters in the string and creates a dictionary of characters and counts of each. Then it returns the string's length.
