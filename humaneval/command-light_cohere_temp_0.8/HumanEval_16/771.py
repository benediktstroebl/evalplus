Here's the improved Python code with the self-contained function and detailed docstrings:
```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Return the number of distinct characters in the input string, regardless of case.
    Args: 
        string (str): The input string
    
    Returns: 
        int: Number of distinct characters
    """
    # Define a set of characters to count
    characters = set(string)
    # Count the distinct characters
    count = len(characters)
    return count

# Test the function with some input strings
test_case = "xyzXYZ"
test_result = count_distinct_characters(test_case)
assert test_result == 3 # Should be 3, all characters are distinct

test_case = "Jerry"
test_result = count_distinct_characters(test_case)
assert test_result == 4 # Should be 4, all characters are distinct

test_case = "abc123"
test_result = count_distinct_characters(test_case)
assert test_result == 5 # Should be 5, all characters are distinct
```

This improved script follows PEP 8 style guidelines, includes detailed docstrings, and provides test cases to ensure the correctness of the `count_distinct_characters` function. The test cases cover different input strings, such as all-caps, all-lowercase, and mixed-case characters.
