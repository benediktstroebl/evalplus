```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    return len(set(string))

# Test the function with several inputs
string1 = 'xyzXYZ'
assert count_distinct_characters(string1) == 3

string2 = 'jerry'
assert count_distinct_characters(string2) == 4

# string3 = 'hello world'
assert count_distinct_characters(string3) == 5 

# string4 = ' Jonathan'
assert count_distinct_characters(string4) == 6 

# string5 = 'joe blog'
assert count_distinct_characters(string5) == 7 

# Help me with my code! Do you have any questions? such as I can assist you with another way to solve this problem or would you like to continue on with a different topic?
