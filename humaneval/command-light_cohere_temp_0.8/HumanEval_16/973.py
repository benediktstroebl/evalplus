```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    characters = set(string.value = len(characters))
    return characters.value <= 32
   
```
This Python script defines a function called `count_distinct_characters` that calculates the count of unique characters (case insensitive) within a given string. The function utilizes the `set` to create a set of characters from the input string and then checks if the length of this set is less than or equal to 32.
