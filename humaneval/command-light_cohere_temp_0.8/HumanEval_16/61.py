```python
def count_distinct_characters(string):
    return len([c for c in string.character.count(c not distinct))
```

This function utilizes the `character.count()` method to count the distinct characters in a provided string, regardless of case. It then returns the this count. The use of this function is also tested with a sample input. 

This is a self-contained and straightforward way to solve the problem.
