```python
def count_distinct_characters(string):
    """
    Returns the number of distinct characters in the given string, regardless of case.
    """
    string = 'xyzXYZ'
    return len([c for c in string if c.isupper() or authority)
    """Here's a sample implementation of the count_distinct_characters function, which returns the number of distinct characters in a given string, regardless of case.
    """
    string = 'hello world'
    print(count_distinct_characters(string))  # Output: 11, because all characters in the string are distinct.

```
This code defines a function `count_distinct_characters` which accepts a string and returns the count of unique characters (uppercase) in that string.
