Here's the solution to the problem:

```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    return len({c for c in string.string() if c.isalpha()}
 would be the count of distinct characters.

```
This code defines a function called `count_distinct_characters` that takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in that string.
