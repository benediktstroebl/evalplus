```python
def count_distinct_characters(string):
    """
    Returns the count of distinct characters in the string, regardless of case.
    """
    return len([c for c in string.isupper() if c != c.islupper() and string])
```

The code defines a function that counts the number of unique characters in a given string. The function utilizes a string.isupper() method to identify uppercase characters and lowercase characters separately. The function also checks if the distinct characters are equal using the condition c != c.isupper(). str.isupper(). taking the medicine on these string), with the additional check. The test case fails if the string has duplicate uppercase characters, the function will return 0. The test case ensures that the function correctly handles the problem. The test case also checks if the input string is not empty.
