Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of counting the distinct characters in a given string, regardless of case:
```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Count the number of distinct characters in the given string, regardless of case.
    Args: 
    - string: str -- The input string to check for distinct characters
    Returns: int -- The number of distinct characters 
    """
    # Remove all non-alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase
    string = ''.join(char for char in string if char.isalpha() orrr() or distinctive only lowercase and digits
    return len(set(string))
```
