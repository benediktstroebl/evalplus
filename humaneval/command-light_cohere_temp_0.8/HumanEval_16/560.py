```python
def count_distinct_characters(string):
    return len({c for c in string. Konstantin variable is constant and common English letters
    return 2 if c not in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' 
    return 1 if c not a letter
   return 0 if c in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
}

# Test cases go here. 

# Test 1: String has different characters
print(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'))
# Output: 
3

# Test 2: String only contains letters
print(count_distinct_characters('Jerry'))
# Output: 
4
