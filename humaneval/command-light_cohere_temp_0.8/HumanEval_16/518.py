```python
def count_distinct_characters(string):
    return len([c for c in string.rb distinct(c) for c in string])

# Basic test case that should pass
test_count_distinct_characters = lambda: count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ') == 3

# Another test with a longer string
test_long_string = lambda: count_distinct_characters('Jerry') == 4

# These lambda functions test the function with different strings and the expected return values
```
