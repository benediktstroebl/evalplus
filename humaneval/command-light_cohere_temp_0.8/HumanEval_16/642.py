The provided Python code defines a function called `count_distinct_characters` that calculates and returns the count of distinct characters in a given input string. The function utilizes the essential modules for regular expressions and set operations. It uses the regular expression (`re`) to identify lowercase alphabet characters in the string and creates a set of character combinations that match those patterns. The function then counts the distinct characters by finding the unique elements in the set and returns the length of that set, which effectively gives the count of distinct characters.

Finally, the code includes an example usage section, where the function is tested with various input strings. This allows you By ensuring the accuracy of the distinct character count, regardless of case. The code's structure follows PEP 8 conventions and is a self-contained solution for the given problem.
