```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str):
    return len({c for c in string.string() if c.isalpha()})
 unique characters
``` 

This code defines a Python function `count_distinct_characters` that calculates the count of distinct characters in a given string. The function uses a `isalpha()` method to iterate over each character in the string and checks if the character is unique by using the `isalpha()` method. 

The function then returns the count of distinct characters in the string.
