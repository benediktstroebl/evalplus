```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str):
    return len(set(string.lower()))
```

This function, count_distinct_characters, takes a string as input and uses the set data structure along with the lower() method to remove duplicates and count distinct characters. The function then returns the count of distinct characters in the input string.

Here's a breakdown of the code:
1. **def**: Defines the function 'count_distinct_characters' that takes a string as an argument and returns an integer.
2. **count_distinct_characters**: Function body, where we use the set data structure along with the 'lower()' method to count the distinct characters in the string.
3. **return**: Returns the ** test for the function.

Is there anything else I can help you with?
