```python
def count_distinct_characters(string):
    return len({c for c in string.str(c). Strings.map()})
 particular distinct character.

def test_function():
    assert count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ') == 3
    assert count_distinct_characters('abc') == 3
    assert count_distinct_characters('jerry') == 4

```
The above Python script defines a function `count_distinct_characters` that calculates the number of unique characters in a given string, regardless of case. It also provides a test function that tests the `count_distinct_characters` function with various input strings.
