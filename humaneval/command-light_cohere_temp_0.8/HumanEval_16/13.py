Here's the improved version of the code:
```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    return len(string.isalpha()) - 
    if string is None or string == '' : 
        raise ValueError("Input string cannot be empty")
    
    char_set = set(string.isalpha())
    more():
    return len(char_set)
```
The function 'count_distinct_characters' accepts a string as input and returns an integer that represents the number of distinct characters in that string, regardless of case. The function first checks if the string is empty and raises an error if it is, then it creates a set of all characters in the string using the 'isalpha()' method. Then, it counts the more() to get the number of distinct characters.
