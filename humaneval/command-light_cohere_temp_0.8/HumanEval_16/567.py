Here's a self-contained Python function that counts the distinct characters in a given string:
```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    return len({c for c in string. strings() if c not in string.string().} return len(set(string.difference(string)))
```
Do you require assistance with any other aspects of Python programming?
