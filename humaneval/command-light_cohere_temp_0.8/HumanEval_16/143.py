Here's the corrected and improved version of the Python script that defines a function to count the number of distinct characters in a given string, including tests:
```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Count the number of distinct characters in the string, regardless of case.
    """
    return sum(1 for c in string if c.isalpha() and0 and is distinct(c)
    """
    return sum(1 for c in string if c.isalpha() and and is distinct(c))
```
The function uses the `isalpha()` method to check if each character is alphabetical, and the `distinct()` method to check if each character is unique in the string. The function then returns the total count of distinct characters.
