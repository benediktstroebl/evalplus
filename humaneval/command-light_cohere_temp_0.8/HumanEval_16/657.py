```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str):
    return len(set(string.lower()))
```

This code provides a function `count_distinct_characters` that calculates the count of distinct characters in a given string, regardless of case. The function uses the `set()` and `lower()` methods to convert all characters to lowercase and then uses the `len()` function to count the number of unique characters. 

The resulting code provides a self-contained solution to the problem. You can use this example for any given markdown code block.
