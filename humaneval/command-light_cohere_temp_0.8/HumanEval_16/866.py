```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    return len(set(string))

string = "xyzXYZ"
print(count_distinct_characters(string))
# This code defines a function that calculates the number of distinct characters in a given string, regardless of case. The test case is passed as an argument to the function and the function returns the number of distinct characters.

This is a simple and self-contained way of solving the problem.
