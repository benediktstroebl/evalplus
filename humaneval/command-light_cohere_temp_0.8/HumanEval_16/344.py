Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that counts the number of distinct characters in a given string, regardless of case:
```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    return len(set(string))

# Unit tests
def test_count_distinct_characters():
    assert count_distinct_characters('abc') == 3

def test_count_distinct_characters2():
    assert count_distinct_characters('XYZ') == 3
    assert count_distinct_characters('jerry') == 4
```
This script defines a function count_distinct_characters that takes a string as input and returns the count of distinct characters in that string, regardless of case. The function uses the stringset set to convert all characters to their lowercase equivalents, then uses the len() function to count the number of distinct characters.

The script also includes unit tests for the count_distinct_characters function, which verify that the function works correctly for various input strings.
