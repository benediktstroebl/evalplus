```python
def count_distinct_characters(string):
    """
    Returns the count of distinct characters in the string, regardless of case.
    """
    # Convert the string to lowercase and remove all non-alphanumeric characters and spaces
    string = ''.join(char for char in string if char.isalnum() or Bars: The string is converted to lowercase, and all non-alphanumeric characters and spaces are removed.
    return sum(1 for c in string if c.isalpha())

    return count
```
Do you require any other help with code implementation or further questions?
