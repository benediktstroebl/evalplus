```python
def count_distinct_characters(string):
    """
    Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (case-insensitive) does it consist of
    Returns: number of distinct characters
    """
    set(string.count(c for c in string if c.isalpha()))
   .return. sum()
 distinct_set()
```Do you need any further assistance with the code? I can provide more code snippets or explain concepts and best practices around the programming language and algorithms you might need for this problem.
