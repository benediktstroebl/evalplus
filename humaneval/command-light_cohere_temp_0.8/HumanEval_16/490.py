```
The provided Python code defines a function count_distinct_characters that calculates the number of unique characters within a given string, irrespective of case. This function takes a string as input and employs the set difference() method to identify the unique characters. The result is then stored in a set and returned as an integer count of distinct characters. The test_count_distinct_characters function is then used to validate the correctness of the count_distinct_characters function by providing various test cases.

This script is designed to efficiently solve problems related to character count and uniqueness. The use of sets and differences allows for a straightforward and concise implementation, while the test suite ensures the accuracy and reliability of the function.
