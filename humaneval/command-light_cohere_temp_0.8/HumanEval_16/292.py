```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    return len({c for c in string.string() if c not c.isalpha() and
    language() or
    return len({c for c in string if c not c.isalpha() and}
   ```

Here is a concise Python function that counts the distinct characters in a given string, regardless of case. It does this using a set of characters and checks if each character is not a letter using the `isalpha()` method. This function can be used to test the solution easily.
