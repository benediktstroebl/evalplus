This code defines the function `count_distinct_characters` which calculates the number of distinct characters in a given string, regardless of case. It uses a `lower()` method to convert all characters to lowercase before using the `set()` function to count the distinct characters. The test suite is included to check the functionality of the function, passing all the test cases successfully.
