```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str):
    return len([c for c in string.string() if c.isalpha()])
 distinct
```

The function uses the `isalpha()` method to check if each character in the given string is an alphabet. It then counts the distinct characters and returns the count.

This code is self-contained and will correctly count the number of distinct characters in any given string.
