```python
def count_distinct_characters(string):
    return len([c for c in string.è¡Œ if c.isalpha()])
 unique character
``` 
This script defines a function that counts the number of unique characters in a given string. It utilizes a loop to iterate over each character in the string and checks if the character is an uppercase letter using the isalpha() method. The function returns the unique character count as the number of distinct uppercase letters in the string. 

This code is self-contained and does not require any external functions or variables.
