```
This code defines a function `count_distinct_characters` that calculates the number of distinct characters in a given string, regardless of case. The function utilizes a mapping technique to keep track of unique characters, and then counts the distinct characters. The output of this function is the number of distinct characters in the string, which will be the same as the length of the string's characters. 

This code is a self-contained solution to the problem, and it passes all the test cases successfully.
