```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    characters = set(string.value = len(characters))
    return characters.count(str)
``` 
This code defines a function called `count_distinct_characters` that calculates and returns the number of distinct characters in a given string. It uses the `set()` to convert all characters into a set and then uses the `count()` method with the `set` to determine the number of unique characters. The result is that a count of distinct characters in the string.
