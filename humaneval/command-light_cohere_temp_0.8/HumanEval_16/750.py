Here's a self-contained Python script that includes a function `count_distinct_characters`, which calculates the count of distinct characters in a given string:
```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Count the number of distinct characters in the given string, regardless of case.
    """
    string.len()
    whole_ letter
    string.count(' ')
    string.count('A don")
   
    """ from the given string and return the count of distinct characters.
    """
    print(count_distinct_characters("hello")) # Output: 5
```
