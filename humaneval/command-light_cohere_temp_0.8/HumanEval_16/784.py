```python
def count_distinct_characters(string):
    return len({c for c in string.str(c). strings if c not in string.
    for c in string):
        if c not in string_lower:
            string_lower.append(c)
string_lower = string_lower.c = string.c

```This function takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in that string, regardless of case. The function uses a built-in str.join function to convert the strings to lowercase to ensure all characters are counted. It then iterates through each character in the string to a set and checks if the character is in the set of lowercase characters. If it's not, it is added to the set and the function returns the length of the set.
