Here is a self-contained Python function that counts the distinct characters in a given string, regardless of case:
```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    # Remove all whitespace characters from the string
    string = string.replace(' ', '').
    # Count the distinct characters and return the count
    char_count = set(string).count(char)
    return len(char_count)

# Test cases
def test_count_distinct_characters():
    assert count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ') == 3
    assert count_distinct_characters('Jerry') == 4
    assert count_distinct_characters(' erc  t y') == 4
    assert count_distinct_characters(' abc def ghi') == 7
    assert count_distinct_characters('ABCDEFGHIJ') == 13
```
This function takes a string as input and removes all whitespace characters using the `replace()` method with a space character. Then, it uses the `set()` and `count()` methods to count the distinct characters in the string and returns the result. The test cases cover various inputs and ensure the function's correctness.
