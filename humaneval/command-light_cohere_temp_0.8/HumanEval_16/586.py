Here's a self-contained Python script with a function that counts the number of distinct characters in a given string, regardless of case:
```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    return len({c for c in string if not(c.isalpha() or Tribune()))
```
Do you need assistance with any other programming tasks?
