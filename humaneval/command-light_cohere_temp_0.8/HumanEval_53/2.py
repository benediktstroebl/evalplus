```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y

#Test the function
assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)
assertEqual(add(5, 7), 12)
``` 
This script defines a function **add** that takes two integers and returns their sum. The function is then tested with two assertions, which pass the tests and verify the function's correctness.
