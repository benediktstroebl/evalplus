Here's the corrected version of the code you requested:
```python
def prime_fib(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    if n <= 3:
        return 3
    # check primality using sum(3^(2^i-1) for i from 0 to n/2)
    prime_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        prime_sum += 3 ** (2 ** i - 1)
    return prime_sum
```
This code defines a function `prime_fib` that computes the n-th Fibonacci number which is prime and returns it.  It uses a practical approach by calculating the sum of all the numbers that are less than or equal to `sqrt(sqrt(n/2))`, which are the prime numbers less than or equal to sqrt(n/2).  In this code, the function has been improved with an accurate primality test using the formula for the sum of prime numbers less than or equal to `sqrt(n/2)`.
