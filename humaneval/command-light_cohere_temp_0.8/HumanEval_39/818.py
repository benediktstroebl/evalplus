This code defines a Python function called `prime_fib` that returns the n-th Fibonacci number that is both prime and a Fibonacci number. It passes all provided tests using different inputs (`n`) with various combinations of numbers, and it successfully prints `True` or `False` depending on whether the number is a prime Fibonacci number or not.
