```
The above code defines two functions: `prime_fib` and `prime_fibonacci`. The `prime_fib` function calculates the n-th Fibonacci number that is prime, and the `prime_fibonacci` function calculates the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime. 

This code is a self-contained solution for the problem you mentioned.
