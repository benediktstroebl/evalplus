```python
def prime_fib(n: int):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    else:
        # Check if the number is divisible by any odd prime less than n
        for i in range(3, n, 2):
            if n % i == 0:
                return i
                break

        # If none are found, it's a prime
        return n

# Test the function
for i in range(1, 10):
    print(prime_fib(i))
``` 
This function is a direct implementation of the same method you described. It starts with checking if the number is less than or equal to 1, and if so, it returns the number itself. If the number is 2, it returns 2. For any other number greater than, it checks if the number is divisible by any odd prime less than n. If it is, it returns that prime. If none are found, it finally returns the number itself, as it is also prime.
