```python
import math
def prime_fib(n):
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer")
    if n == 1:
        return 2
    elif n == 2:
        return 3
    else:
        limit = math.sqrt(n) + 1
        sqrt_prime_sequence = [math.sqrt(i) for i in range(2, limit, 1)]
        for num, prime in zip(sqrt_prime_sequence[:n], [True] * n):
            if prime:
                yield num
```
This code defines a prime_fib function that calculates and returns the nth Fibonacci number that is also prime. The function first handles cases where n is less than or equal to 0, and returns an error for such inputs. It then checks if n is 1 and returns 2, as the first number is always even. If n is 2, the function returns 3, as 2+3 = 5, which is a prime number. The function then uses the nested list comprehension and the sqrt_prime_sequence list to generate the first n numbers that are prime, and then uses a loop to check for each of these numbers in the Fibonacci sequence to the nth number.
