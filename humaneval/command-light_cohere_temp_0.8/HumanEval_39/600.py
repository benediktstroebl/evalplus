    A simple prime is one of the form 6k+1 or 2k-1 where k is positive integer.
    A composite number is numbers greater than 1 that are not prime are of the form 6k+1 or 6k-1 for some positive integer k.
    A special case is a unique factorization.

This Python script defines a function `prime_fib` that returns the n-th Fibonacci number that is prime. It utilizes a unique factorization of n, where a prime is either 2k+1 or 6k-1, and composite numbers are of the form 6k+1 or 6k-1 for some positive integer k. The function handles all edge cases and passes the corresponding test cases.
