```python

    """
    Returns the n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and is also prime.
    >>> print(prime_fib(1))

    """

The above code defines a function called `prime_fib` which aims to find the n-th Fibonacci number that is prime, and returns it. It uses a test to loop through the first few Fibonacci numbers, checking if each one is prime, and returns the n-th number that passes the test.
