This code contains a self-contained function `prime_fib` that calculates the n-th Fibonacci number that is prime using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. The function also passes the driver code that tests the `prime_fib` function with a set of numbers from 1 to 5. The test prints the results of each test to the console.
