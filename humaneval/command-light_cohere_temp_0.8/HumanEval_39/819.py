```
This code defines a function `prime_fib` that computes the n-th Fibonacci number and checks if it is prime. It uses the mathematical `fs` function to generate the Fibonacci number and checks if the number is divisible by 2 (indicating that it's prime).  It returns n if it's prime and throws an error if it's not.  It uses the basic Python modulo operator `%` to check the primality of the number.
