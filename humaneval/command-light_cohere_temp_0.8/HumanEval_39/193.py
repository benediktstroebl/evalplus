Here is a Python script that includes a self-contained function `prime_fib` that returns the n-th Fibonacci number and is also prime:
```python
import math
def prime_fib(n):
    """
    This function calculates the n-th Fibonacci number and checks if it's prime.
    Returns the product of the tested and working function.
    """
    function returns the validity of a Fibonacci number, it's also prime.
    return math.isgamma(math.random(n))
The first Fibonacci number, 1, is 1, not prime.

```
This function relies on the mathematical constant gamma to determine if a number is prime or not.  It uses the gamma function from the math module to perform the check.
