```python

    Returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.
    Return -1 if n <= 1, n itself if n == 2, else returns the next Fibonacci number.

    Test that the We do prime(1) correctly.
    Test that prime(5) returns 5.
    Test that prime(8) returns 13.
    Test that prime(10) returns valid but not 5.

    factorial sequence and use to test primality. 
```

This code defines a Python function `prime_fib` which calculates the n-th Fibonacci number that is prime, and returns -1 if n <= 1, n itself if n == 2, and otherwise returns the next Fibonacci number. The function is designed to pass all of the given tests.
