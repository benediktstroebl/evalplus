```python
def prime_fib(n: int):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    elif n <= 3:
        return 2
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 3
    else:
        i = 5
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % (i + 1) == 0:
                return i
            i += 6
        return next((x for x in range(5) if x * x > n))
```
This code implements a function called `prime_fib` that computes the nth prime Fibonacci number and returns it. The function starts by handling special cases where n is less than or equal to 1, which return n directly. It then handles the particular cases for the Fibonacci numbers, which are 2 and 3 for n <= 3. For larger values, the function uses a trial-and-error approach with an inner loop that tries numbers from 5 to the square root of n, incrementing by 6 each time around the loop. The function returns the specific Fibonacci number that is not greater than n, or returns the next number in the sequence if none is found.
