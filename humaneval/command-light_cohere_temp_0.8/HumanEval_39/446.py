    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:

```
This code defines a function called prime_fibonacci that calculates the nth Fibonacci number using an iterative algorithm while checking for primality. The code efficiently finds the prime numbers by utilizing the fact that a number is prime if it satisfies two conditions: (i) it's greater than 1, and (ii) it has no divisors or divisors that are smaller than the square root of the number.
