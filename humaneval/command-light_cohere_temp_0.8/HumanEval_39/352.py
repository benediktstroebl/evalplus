Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function `prime_fib` that calculates and returns the n-th Fibonacci number that is also a prime:
```python
def prime_fib(n: int):
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("n should be a positive integer")

    # The first two Fibonacci numbers are 2 and 3, which are prime.
    if n == 1:
        return 2
    elif n == 2:
        return 3

    # For n greater than 2, the n-th Fibonacci number is composite and not prime.
    # We prime_factors(n) using the `factorize` function from the `math` module, which returns a list of prime factors.
    factors = factorize(n)
    for factor in factors:
        if factor != 2 and factor != 3:
            return factor

    # Find the largest prime factor
    factor = max(factors, key=lambda x: x)
    return int(factor)**(n - 2)

# Test cases
print(prime_fib(1))  # Output: 2
print(prime_fib(2))  # Output: 3
print(prime_fib(5))  # Output: 89
print(prime_fib(6))  # Output: 144)
print(prime_fib(7))  # Should raise ValueError
```

This code defines a function `prime_fib` that computes the n-th Fibonacci number and checks if it is prime. It uses the fact that the first two Fibonacci numbers are prime and then iteratively finds the largest prime factor to ensure the result is prime.
