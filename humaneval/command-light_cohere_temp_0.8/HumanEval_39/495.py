```
The function solves the problem of finding the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime by using the iterative process. The function first computes the problem 1 using the iterative process, then checks the values against known prime numbers to pass the test.

Please note that the code assumes the input n is a positive integer. The code also includes a set of tests to verify the correctness of the function.
