```python
def prime_fib(n: int):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return prime_fib(n - 2)
    else:
        # Check if the number is a prime using optimized primality testing
        if n <= 3:
            return True
        for i in range(4, int(n**.5) + 1, 5):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
```
This optimized function uses an improved primality test which is significantly faster than the standard testing. It reduces the the both the the case where n is even, and then recursively checks for primality by reducing n by 2 and testing for divisibility from 4 up to sqrt(n).
