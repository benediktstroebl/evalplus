This script defines a function called `prime_fib` that computes the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence that is prime and also passes the test. 

The function uses recursion to calculate the prime Fibonacci number. It first handles base cases for `n` equal to 1 and 2, and then uses the floor division technique along with the `prime_fib` recursive call to calculate the nth Fibonacci prime number. The function also uses the double-checking technique to handle the case of even `n`, which ensures the correctness of the result.
