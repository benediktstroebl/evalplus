```python
def prime_fib(n: int):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return prime_fib(n // 2) + 2
    else:
        temp = prime_fib(n // 2)
        return temp + (temp > 2 and 2 or 1)

# Test the function
print(prime_fib(5))
``` 
This function, `prime_fib`, calculates and returns the n-th Fibonacci number that is prime, if n is a positive integer. The function employs a recursive approach, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, following the foundational sequence of Fibonacci numbers. It also incorporates an optimization technique of avoiding redundant calculations by utilizing the fact that the (n+1)th Fibonacci number is always one more than the (n//2)th prime number.
