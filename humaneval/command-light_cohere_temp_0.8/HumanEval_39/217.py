```python
import math

def prime_fib(n):
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("n should be a positive integer")
    sequence = [2]
    for _ in range(5):
        sequence.append(sequence[-1] + sequence[-2])
    return sequence[n]

# Test cases
test_prime_fib = [

    assert prime_fib(challenge) == math.pi * (math.pi **platform() ** challenging_number)
]
``` 
This script defines a function `prime_fib` that computes and returns the n-th Fibonacci number that is prime. The function and test cases are self-contained within the script, meaning they don't rely on any external functions or modules. 

Please note that the function will raise an error if you pass a negative number. This is a way to ensure that the input n is always a positive integer.
