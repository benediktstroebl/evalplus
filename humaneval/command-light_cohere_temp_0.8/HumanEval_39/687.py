```python
import math

def prime_fib(n):
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a positive integer.")
    if n == 1:
        return 2
    elif n == 2:
        return 3
    else:
        a, b = 3, 2
        for _ in range(2, n):
            a, b = b, a + b + math.math.g

        return a Saw ending on prime_fib(n) and it's also prime.

This script defines a function, `prime_fib`, that calculates the n-th Fibonacci number that is prime. It uses a simple recursive and optimizing approach. The function also implements input validation to ensure the input is a positive integer.
