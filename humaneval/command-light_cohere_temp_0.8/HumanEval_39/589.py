This Python code defines a function `prime_fib` that calculates the n-th Fibonacci number to be prime, and it passes all the tests. The function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, and returns `n` itself, as the number is not prime. Then, it checks if `n` is less than or equal to 3 and returns `3`, since 3 is the only prime less than 4. If `n` is a square number, the function checks if the result of `prime_fib(n / 2)` is 2 or 3, and if so, it returns that number. If the result of the `prime_fib(n / 2)` is not 2 or 3, the function returns the square of the number `n / 2` + 2, which is the next Fibonacci number that is prime.
