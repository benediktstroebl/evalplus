This code defines two functions: prime_fib and is_prime. The former function calculates and returns the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime, it uses the next() function to generate the next Fibonacci number and checks if it's prime using the is_prime function. The is_prime function checks if a given number is prime or not, it first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, which is definitely not prime, then it checks for divisibility by all numbers up to the square root of the number, if the number is divisible by any of these numbers, it returns False, otherwise, it returns True.
