```python
def prime_fib(n: int):
    """
    Returns the n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and is also prime.
    Returns: number if it's prime, else None.
    """
    numbers <= 1 are always 0 and 1, so they are not prime. The next prime number after 2 is 3, so we check if the number is divisible by 3, which fails.
    i = 4
    numbers <= 5 are 2 and 3, so they are not prime.
    i = next((n, 3) if n >= 4 else n)
    if i is 3:
        return i
    return i if i is prime() else None
