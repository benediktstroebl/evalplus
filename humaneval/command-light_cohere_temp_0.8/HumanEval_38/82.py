This code defines a self-contained function called `encode_cyclic` that takes a string `s` as input and returns an encoded string. The function splits the string into groups of length 3 and cycles elements in each group. The function also concatenates groups that have fewer elements than 3 into a single group. 

The code also defines a self-contained function called `decode_cyclic` that takes an encoded string as input and returns a decoded string. The function splits the elements in each group in the original string and returns a decoded string.
