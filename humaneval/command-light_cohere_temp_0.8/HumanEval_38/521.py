This script defines a self-contained function that takes a string s, and performs both encoding and decoding operations using string slicing and concatenation. It also provides a tests for the function to ensure it works correctly.

The encode_cyclic function splits the input string into groups of three characters, and then cycles the characters within each group. The decoded_cyclic function simply passes the encoded string through the decode function.
