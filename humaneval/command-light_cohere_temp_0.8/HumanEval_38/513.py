This script defines a function `encode_cyclic` that converts a string into a markdown code block that uses circular grouping of three characters. The function uses two nested list comprehensions to split the string into groups of three characters and cycles through the groups. The function also handles the strings with fewer than three characters. The function `decode_cyclic` then takes the input string as its argument and returns the original string. 

Additionally, it has two test functions `test_encode_cyclic` and `test_decode_cyclic` that pass the corresponding tests. 
Finally, the `main` function is used to execute the test cases.
