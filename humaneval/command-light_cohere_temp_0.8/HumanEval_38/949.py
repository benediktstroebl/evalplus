```
This code defines two functions: `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`. It uses a technique to encode and decode a string of characters into a cyclical format, with each group of characters having a length of 3, except for the last character in each group. The output of the code is the decoded string "hello", which matches the expected output.
