This Python script defines a self-contained function called `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` that solves the problem and passes the tests. The `encode_cyclic` function splits a given string into groups of three characters, and cycles the characters in each group. The `decode_cyclic` function takes the input string encoded by the `encode_cyclic` function and returns the decoded string. The code also provides several test cases to verify the correctness of the functions.
