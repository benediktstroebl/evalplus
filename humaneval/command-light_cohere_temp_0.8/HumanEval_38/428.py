This code defines a Python function `encode_cyclic` and its companion `decode_cyclic` that together solve the problem. The `encode_cyclic` function encodes a given string by cycling groups of three characters. The `decode_cyclic` function takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. The code also passes the test to ensure the functions are correct.
