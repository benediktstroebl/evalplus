This script defines a self-contained function that takes a string as input, performs the encoding and decoding operations, and passes the tests.

The code defines a function called `encode_cyclic` that takes a string `s` as input and returns an encoded string. The function uses string slicing to split the input string into groups of three characters and then cycles the characters in each group. If the length of a group is three, the characters are joined back together. If the length of a group is less than three, the group is returned as is. The function also returns an string representing the entire sequence of groups.

The function called `decode_cyclic` takes an encoded string as input and returns a decoded string. The function uses the same encoding and decoding logic as the `encode_cyclic` function. The function passes the test cases to verify the correctness of the encoding and decoding operations.
