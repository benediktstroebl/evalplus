This Python code defines two functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, to encode and decode cyclic markdown strings. The `encode_cyclic` function splits the input string into groups of three characters and cycles the elements within each group. The `decode_cyclic` function takes the encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. The code also provides test cases to verify the correctness of the `decode_cyclic` function.

Overall, this code offers a self-contained solution and testing framework for encoding and decoding cyclic markdown strings.
