This code defines a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes all the corresponding tests. The encode_cyclic function splits the input string into groups of three characters, then cycles the first character of each group and returns the modified string. The decode_cyclic function takes an encoded string and decodes it by passing it to the encode_cyclic function. The two functions can be used as a pair, where one function calls the other to perform the encoding and decoding steps.
