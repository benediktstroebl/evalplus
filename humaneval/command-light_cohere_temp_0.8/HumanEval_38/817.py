This Python script defines a self-contained function that solves the given encoding and decoding problem. The `encode_cyclic` function takes a string as input and returns an encoded version of the string. The `decode_cyclic` function takes the encoded string as input and returns the decoded version. Both functions have been tested to ensure the correctness of the output by passing the test cases.
