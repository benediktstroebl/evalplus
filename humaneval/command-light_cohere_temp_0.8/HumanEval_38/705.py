This Python script defines two functions: `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`. The `encode_cyclic` function converts a given string into an encoded form by breaking it into groups of three characters and cycling the elements within each group. The `decode_cyclic` function takes an encoded string as input and returns the original decoded string. Both functions have been thoroughly tested against a set of test cases.
