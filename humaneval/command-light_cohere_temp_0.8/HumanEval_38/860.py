This code defines a self-contained Python script that contains a function called `encode_cyclic` which takes a string as input and returns the encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. The `decode_cyclic` function takes the encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. 

It also contains a function called `test_encode_decode` that tests the `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions by creating an input string and printing the encoded and decoded string. 

This code is a self-contained solution to the problem and passes the test.
