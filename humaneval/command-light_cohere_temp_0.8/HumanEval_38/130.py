This Python code defines a self-contained function that solves the given markdown code block problem:
```python
def encode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.
    """
    # split string to groups Each of length 3.
    groups = s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)
    # cycle elements in each group
    groups = [(group[1:] + group[0]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups)

def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    start by noting that this is exactly what we expect it to do.
    """
    test cases:
    ```python
    assert encode_cyclic("Hello World!") == "h..."
    assert encode_cyclic("hgg Tend Coin!") == "hello moon"
    assert encode_cyclic("") == ""
    assert encode_cyclic("A") == "Z"
    assert encode_cyclic("aa") == "Yodeloz()"
    assert encode_cyclic("AAAA") == "YZhzozroaa"
    ```
