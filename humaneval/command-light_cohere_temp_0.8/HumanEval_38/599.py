This Python script defines a self-contained function, `encode_cyclic`, that takes a string `s` as input and returns a string that has been encoded by cycling groups of three characters. The `decode_cyclic` function takes an input string and returns the original string, which has been decoded from the encoding produced by the `encode_cyclic` function.
