This code defines a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of encoding and decoding markdown code blocks with circular groups of three characters. The encode_cyclic function takes a string s as input and returns the encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. The function splits the string into groups of three characters, then cycles the elements in each group. The decode_cyclic function takes the encoded string s as input and returns the decoded string. 

The test cases demonstrate the functionality of the functions by passing different strings to them and printing the results. This code is expected output.
