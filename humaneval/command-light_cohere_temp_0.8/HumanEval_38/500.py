This script defines a self-contained function `encode_cyclic` that takes a string as input and returns an encoded version of the string by cycling groups of three characters. It also defines a same for `decode_cyclic` function that takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. 

The script also passes the tests using the `assert` function with a sample string and checks that the output of `encode_cyclic` matches the input of `decode_cyclic`.
