The code defines a function called `encode_cyclic` that splits a given string into groups of three characters, then cycles the characters in each group and joins the characters back together to form an encoded string. The `decode_cyclic` function takes an encoded string as input and returns the original decoded string. The code also provides a corresponding test to ensure the correctness of the `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions.
