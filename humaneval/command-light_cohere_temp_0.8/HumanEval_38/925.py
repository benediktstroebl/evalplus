This Python script defines a self-contained function called `encode_cyclic` that converts a given string into an encoded format. The function splits the string into groups of three characters, with each group containing at least three characters. The function then cycles the characters within each group, with the final encoded string returned as a single string. The `decode_cyclic` function is also defined to take an input string and return the decoded version of that string. It performs the actual decoding of the encoded string by the `encode_cyclic` function.
