The code defines a Python script with two self-contained functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`. These functions take a string as input and return the encoded or decoded string, respectively. 

The `encode_cyclic` function splits the input string into groups of three characters, and then cycles the characters in each group. The `decode_cyclic` function takes the encoded string and returns the decoded string.

The script also comes with two test functions, `test_encode_cyclic` and `test_decode_cyclic`, which pass their tests to the functions. The `test_encode_cyclic` function returns `True` since the encode and decode functions pass the tests. The `test_decode_cyclic` function returns `True` since the decode function correctly decodes the input string.

Finally, the code uses the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block to indicate that the functions will only be executed if the script is run directly.
