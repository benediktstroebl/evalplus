    >> decode_cyclic("PF")
    "PPP"

    Test case 2:
    "PFPF:" should return "PFPFP"
    >> decode_cyclic("PFPF")
    "PFPFP"

    Test case 3:
    "PFPFP..." should return "PFPFP"

    "PFPFP"

    Test case 4:
    "PFPFPKJ" should return "PFKJ"

    "PFKJ"

    Test case 5:

Your code is a self-contained Python script that provides a function to encode and decode markdown code using a cyclic group approach. It passes all tests for the maximize the code readability, and maintainability.
