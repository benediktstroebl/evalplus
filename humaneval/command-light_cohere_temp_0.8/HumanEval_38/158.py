This Python code defines a self-contained function pair to solve and validate a problem related to encoding and decoding cyclic groups of characters. The encode_cyclic function splits a given string into substrings of length 3, cycles elements in each group, and returns an encoded string. The decode_cyclic function takes this encoded string as input and returns the decoded version of the original string. This function pair allows for straightforward testing and evaluation of the two functions.
