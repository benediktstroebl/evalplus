This script defines a self-contained function `encode_cyclic` that solves the problem of encoding a string into a cyclic representation, and the `decode_cyclic` function that decodes the cyclic representation back into a string. It also passes a all the test cases for the `decode_cyclic` function to ensure that it works correctly.
