The code defines a Python function `encode_cyclic` that takes a string `s` as input and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. It then splits the by each group of three characters and cycles elements in each group. The function also checks that the length of each group is exactly three. Finally, the function returns an string that can be decoded using the `decode_cyclic` function.

This code is a self-contained implementation of the problem and passes the tests. It can be used as a basis for further development or modification.
