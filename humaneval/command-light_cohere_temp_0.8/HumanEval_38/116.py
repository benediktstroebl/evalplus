```
The `encode_cyclic` function converts a string into an encoded format. It then cycles groups of three characters together and returns the encoded string. The `decode_cyclic` function takes an encoded string and converts it back to a decoded string. It uses a `decode_constant` helper function to remove all characters except alphabets from the input string.

This approach ensures that the code is self-contained and does not rely on external functions or modules. It passes all the support tests with the code to ensure correctness.
