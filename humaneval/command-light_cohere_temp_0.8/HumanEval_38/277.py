This script defines a function `encode_cyclic` that takes a string as input and returns an encoded version of the string. The `encode_cyclic` function uses a technique to split the string into groups of three characters and then cycles through these groups. It uses a same approach for decoding, the `decode_cyclic` function takes the encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. 

This solution and the provided tests are self-contained, meaning that you can use them as a standalone solution to solve the problem of encoding and decoding markdown code into a cyclic format.
