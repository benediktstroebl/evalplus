This Python code defines a self-contained function named `encode_cyclic` that takes a string `s` as input and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. It creates a `groups` by slicing the input string to obtain substrings of length 3, and then cycles the characters in each group. The `decode_cyclic` function takes an input string `s` and performs the reverse operation of `encode_cyclic`, returning the decoded string. The code also passes the test cases for the `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions.
