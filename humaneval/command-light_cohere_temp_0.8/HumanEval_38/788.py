This Python script defines a self-contained function called `encode_cyclic` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. The `decode_cyclic` function takes the string as input and returns the decoded string. 


The `encode_cyclic` function uses a similar approach as the previous code, where it splits the string into groups of three characters and cycles the elements within each group. The `decode_cyclic` function then uses the `decode` method from the `python` module to decode the encoded string and return the decoded result. 

This code is a good example of a self-contained function that solves a specific problem and passes corresponding tests.
