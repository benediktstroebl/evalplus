The script defines two functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, which take a string as input and return a decoded version of that string.

The `test_encode_cyclic` function passes the test by encoding the string "aaaaaaacccdeee" and comparing the result with the decoded version of the same string. 
The `test_decode_cyclic` function passes the test by encoding the string "acceeed" and comparing the result with the decoded version of the same string. 
The main function is used to execute the test cases.
