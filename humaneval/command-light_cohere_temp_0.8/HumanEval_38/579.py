The given code defines two functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, which are self-contained. The `encode_cyclic` function splits a string into groups of three characters and cycles each character in the group. The `decode_cyclic` function takes an encoded string and returns the decoded string.

This code also includes a function `test_encode_decode` which contains a test string and passes the test by calling the `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions with the test string and comparing the output of the decoded string with the expected output.
