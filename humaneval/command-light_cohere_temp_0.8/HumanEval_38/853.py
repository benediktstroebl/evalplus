This code includes two functions: `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`. These functions convert a given string into an encoded string and then back into a decoded string, respectively. The `decode_cyclic` function calls the `encode_cyclic` function to encode the input string and then returns the entire input string as the decoded string.
