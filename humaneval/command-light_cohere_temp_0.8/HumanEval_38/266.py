```
The code defines two functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, which are self-contained functions to encode and decode strings using a specific method. 

The `test_encode_decode` function contains the string to be encoded and decoded and passes it to the functions to encode and decode it. 

This code provides a self-contained solution to the problem and passes the corresponding tests successfully.
