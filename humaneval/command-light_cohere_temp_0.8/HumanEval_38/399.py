```python
def encode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters
    This function splits the string into groups of length 3 and cycles the first character of each group, then concatenates all the rest of the characters in the group.
    """return "".join(groups)

def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string
   
```
This Python code implements the encode_cyclic and decode_cyclic functions. 

The encode_cyclic function accepts a string s and returns an encoded version of s. It accomplishes this task by first splitting the string into groups of length 3, then cycling the first character of each group and concatenating the rest of the characters in each group. 

The decode_cyclic function takes an encoded string s and returns the decoded version of s. It works by reversing the string until the first character matches the last character in the original string and concatenates all the characters in the original string.
