This Python script defines two functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, that are used to encode and decode a string with a cyclic pattern of groups of three characters. The encode_cyclic function splits the string into groups of length three and cycles the elements of each group. The `decode_cyclic` function then decodes the input string. The script also includes a function `test_encode_decode` which contains a test string and verifies that the `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions output the same string.
