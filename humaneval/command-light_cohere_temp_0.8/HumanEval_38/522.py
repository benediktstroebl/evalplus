This Python script defines a self-contained function, `encode_cyclic`, which transforms a given string by creating groups of three characters, and the `decode_cyclic` function, which accepts an encoded string and returns the decoded version. The script also includes a `test_encode_decode` function with test cases for the `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions.
