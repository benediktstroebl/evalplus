This code defines two functions: `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`. The `encode_cyclic` function takes a string as input and returns a string that has been encoded using a cyclic group of three characters. The `decode_cyclic` function takes a string as input and returns the original string, which is the decoded version of the input string.

The `__name__` check is used to ensure that the code is run as a standalone script, and it is not executed within an external function or class. The script will print the detailed information about the encode and decode process.
