This code implements a function called **encode_cyclic** that takes a string as input and returns a string that has been encoded using a specific encoding technique. The same function called **decode_cyclic** takes an input string and returns the original string, which is the decoded version of the input string. The code also passes the tests for both functions, and the output of the **encode_cyclic** function when passed the **decode_cyclic** function is the same as the input.
