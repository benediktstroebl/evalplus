The script provides a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes the corresponding tests. It defines the function 'encode_cyclic' that takes a string s as input and returns the encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. It also defines 'decode_cyclic' that takes an encoded string s as input and returns the decoded string. It also has helper functions 'encode' and 'decode' that test if 'encode_cyclic' and 'decode_cyclic' functions produce the correct output for a given string.
