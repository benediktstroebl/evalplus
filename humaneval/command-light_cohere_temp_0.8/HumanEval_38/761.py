This Python code defines a self-contained function called encode_cyclic that performs the encoding of a given string by cycling groups of three characters. The code then defines a second function called decode_cyclic that takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. The code also includes two blocks of tests that pass for the functions, demonstrating the correctness of the implementation.
