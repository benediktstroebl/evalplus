This Python script defines a self-contained function `encode_cyclic` that encodes a given string by cycling groups of three characters. It also defines a `decode_cyclic` function that decodes the encoded string. The `encode_cyclic` function splits the input string into groups of three characters, and then cycles the characters within each group. The `decode_cyclic` function then returns the original decoded string.
