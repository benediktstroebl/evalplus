```
This code defines a function called `encode_cyclic` that splits a string into groups of three characters, then cycles elements in each group. The `decode_cyclic` function takes an encoded string and returns the decoded string. The `test_encode_decode` function tests the `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions with a few sample strings. 
This code demonstrates a self-contained solution to the given problem and passes all tests.
