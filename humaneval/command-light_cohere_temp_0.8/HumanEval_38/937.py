Here's a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of encoding and decoding a cyclic group of characters:
```python
def encode_decode_cyclic(s: str) -> str:
    """
    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.
    From a particular string to groups of length 3.
    groups = s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s)) for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    # cycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
    groups = [(group[1:] + group[0]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups)

def decode_cyclic(s: str) -> str:
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.
    """
   l code back string with newline characters
    """
    return '\n'.join(decode_cyclic(s.encode_cyclic()))

# test cases
def test_encode_decode():
    """
    test cases for encoding and decoding functions.
    """
    for i in range(1, 10):
        s = f"Hello {i}"
        print("Case {i}: Original String:", s)
        print("Expected Encoded:", encode_decode_cyclic(s))
        print("Expected Decoded:", decode_cyclic(encode_decode_cyclic(s)))

test_encode_decode()
```
This script defines a function `encode_decode_cyclic` that encodes a string by cycling groups of three characters, and decodes the encoded string back to its original form. The `decode_cyclic` function takes an encoded string and returns the decoded string, with newline characters added to separate groups of characters. The `test_encode_decode` function provides test cases to verify the correctness of the `encode_decode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions.
