This Python code defines a set of functions for encoding and decoding strings using a specific cyclic encoding and decoding technique. It uses these functions to convert between an input string and an encoded representation, which is then reversed to retrieve the original decoded string.

The encode_cyclic function splits the input string into groups of three characters, cycling the elements within each group. It uses a recursive approach to encode the string, where the base case is to use the first character of the group, and then append the next character to the end of the previous character.

The decode_cyclic function takes an input string that was encoded using the encode_cyclic function. It uses the same to decode the string, which is the reverse of the encode_cyclic function. The decoded string is then returned.

The code also includes a set of test cases to verify the functionality of the encode_cyclic and decode_cyclic functions. The test cases cover a valid encode/decode pairs, ensuring that the output of the decode_cyclic function matches the original input string.
