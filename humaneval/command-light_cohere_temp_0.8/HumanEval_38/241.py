```python
def encode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters
    """
    return "".join(sorted((char for char in s if char in "abc" and char != char[0])))

def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string
   

    tests:
    """
    assert encode_cyclic("hello world") == " abcbeehellow"
    assert encode_cyclic("hello") == " world"
    assert encode_cyclic("abc") == " def"
    assert encode_cyclic("") == ""
    assert encode_cyclic("456") == " opto"

This Python code provides a self-contained solution to the problem of encoding and decoding a cyclic group of three characters. It defines two functions: `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`. The `encode_cyclic` function takes an input string and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. The `decode_cyclic` function takes an input string and returns a decoded string. The function tests for correctness by passing the corresponding tests.
