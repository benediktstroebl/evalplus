This Python code defines a self-contained function called `encode_cyclic` and another function `decode_cyclic`. The `encode_cyclic` function takes an input string `s` and returns the encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. The `decode_cyclic` function takes an input string `s` that was encoded using the `encode_cyclic` function, and returns the decoded string. The code also passes tests for both functions, asserting that they work correctly.
