This Python code defines a self-contained function called **encode_cyclic** and another called **decode_cyclic**. The **encode_cyclic** function returns the encoded version of an input string by cycling groups of three characters. The function uses a list comprehension to split the input string into groups of three characters, and then cycles the elements in each group. The function uses a list comprehension again to replace the cycle elements with the first character of the group, and then joins the group back into a single string. The **decode_cyclic** function takes an input string that was encoded using the **encode_cyclic** function, and returns the decoded string.
