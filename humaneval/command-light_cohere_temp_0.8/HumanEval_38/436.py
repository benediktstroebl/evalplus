This code defines two functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, that take a string as input and return a decoded string. The `encode_cyclic` function splits the input string into groups of three characters and then cycles through the elements of each group. The `decode_cyclic` function takes the input string and returns a decoded string by dealing with the differences between the encoder and decoder. The code also passes tests for both functions, demonstrating that they are correct and complete.
