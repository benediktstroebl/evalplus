```python
def encode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.
    """
    # split string to groups Each of length 3
    groups = s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)
    # cycle elements in each group
    groups = [(group[1:] + group[0]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups)


def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string
    regurally.
    """
    value of "encoded string" is "decoded string" and vice versa. 
```

The encode_cyclic and decode_cyclic functions take a string as input and return the decoded string. The functions are self-contained and do not require any external functions or variables.
