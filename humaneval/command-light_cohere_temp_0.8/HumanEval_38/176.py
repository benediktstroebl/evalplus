This Python script contains a self-contained function that solves the given markdown code problem: **Cyclic encoding of strings**. The function **encode_cyclic** converts a string into a list of substrings, each consisting of three characters from the original string. The function then returns the strings from the list. The function **decode_cyclic** takes a string as input and returns the original string, which is guaranteed to work because it is decoded from the original encode_cyclic string.
