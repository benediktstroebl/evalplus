The code defines two functions: `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`. The `encode_cyclic` function splits the input string into groups of three characters, then cycles the first character of each group. The `decode_cyclic` function takes the input string encoded with `encode_cyclic` and returns the decoded string. It also passes the is designed to be a self-contained solution for the given problem, as it passes all the test cases without errors.
