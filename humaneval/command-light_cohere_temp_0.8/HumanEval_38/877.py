Here's the self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem:
```python
def encode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.
    """
    # split string to groups Each of length 3
    groups = s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)
    # cycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
    groups = [(group[1:] + group[0]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups
    return "".join(groups)

def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    required encoded string that can be decoded by this function.
    """
    return s
decode(s.index=decode(s, alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUV'))

# test cases
test_encode = ["AARK"]
test_decode = ["B "]

result_encode = encode_cyclic(test_encode)
result_decode = decode_cyclic(test_decode)

print("encode:", result_encode)
print("decode:", result_decode)
```
The function encode_cyclic converts an input string into an encoded string. The encoded string contains alternating groups of three characters. The function then decodes the string by converting each group into its corresponding letter.
