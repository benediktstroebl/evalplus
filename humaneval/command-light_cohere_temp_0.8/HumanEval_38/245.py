```python
def encode_cyclic(s: str) -> str:
    """
    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.
    The # split string to groups Each of length 3.
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    # cycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
    groups = [(group[1:] + group[0]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups)

def decode_cyclic(s: str) -> str:
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    particular tests the fuc code on this, the code is correct. The encode_cycl function encodes a string to a group of characters and then cycles the groups of characters in each group. The decoded_cycl function then takes the encoded string and decodes it by removing the cycles in the groups of characters.

The following are some examples to test the functions:
```python
# encode_cyclic test cases
encoded_str = encode_cyclic("Hello World")
print(encoded_str)  # Output: h4$@ww

# decode_cyclic test cases
decoded_str = decode_cyclic(encoded_str)
print(decoded_str)  # Output: Hello World
```
