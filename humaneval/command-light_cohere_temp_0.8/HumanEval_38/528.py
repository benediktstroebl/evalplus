The Python script provided above has a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests. It defines two functions: one to encode a string with groups of three characters and the other to decode a string. It is tested to return the decoded string, which is the original input string, and it passes the test with the encoded and decoded strings being equal. The test is included to ensure the correctness of the encode_cyclic and decode_cyclic functions.
