This Python code defines a self-contained function called `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`. The `encode_cyclic` function takes a string as input and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. The `decode_cyclic` function takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. Both functions pass all the permutations and have descriptive docstrings.
