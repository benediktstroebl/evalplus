This code provides a self-contained function to encode and decode a string using the concept of cycling groups of three characters. The encode_cyclic function splits the string into groups of three characters, cycles the group elements, and then concatenates the elements back together to form the original string. The decode_cyclic function performs the reverse operation to decode the encoded string.
