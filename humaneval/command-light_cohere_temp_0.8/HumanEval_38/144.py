This Python script defines two functions: `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`. The `encode_cyclic` function takes a string as input and returns an encoded version of the string. It splits the group of three characters each and encodes them by cycling them in groups of length three. The `decode_cyclic` function takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded version of the string. It tests the strings and raises an error if they do not meet certain criteria.
