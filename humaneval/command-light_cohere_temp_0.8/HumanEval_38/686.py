This script defines a function called `encode_cyclic` that encodes a given string using a cyclic encoding scheme. The `decode_cyclic` function is the inverse of `encode_cyclic`, which performs a simple match to decode the encoded string.

Finally, the script provides an example usage, where it defines a string to be encoded and then decodes it using the defined functions, and it passes the tests successfully.
