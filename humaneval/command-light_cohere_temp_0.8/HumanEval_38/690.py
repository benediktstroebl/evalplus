This code defines a function called `encode_cyclic` which takes a string `s` as input and returns an encoded version of this string. The string is split into groups of length 3, and each group is encoded using the prefix "..." The resulting encoded string is then returned.

The code also defines a function called `decode_cyclic` which takes an encoded string s as input and returns the decoded version of this string. The actual decoded string is returned.
