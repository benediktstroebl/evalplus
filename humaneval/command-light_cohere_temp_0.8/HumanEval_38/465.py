The encoding of a string is a sequence of
    characters, where the first character is the most
    significant character, and the last character is the least
    significant character.

encode_cyclic: A string is passed into the encode_ cycliclex function. This function splits theator string into groups of three characters. For each group, the first character is added to the string, followed by the second character, and the two are concatenated together. If the length of the group is three, then the string is returned as the group. If the length of the group is less than three, then the first character of the group is added to the string, followed by the second character, and the group is appended to the end of the string.

decode_cyclic: A string is passed into the decode_cyclic function. This function takes the since as input string encoded with the encode_cyclic function. It splits the string into groups of three characters. For each group, the first character is removed from the string, followed by the second character, and the two are concatenated together. If the length of the group is three, then the string is returned as the group. If the length of the group is less than three, then the string is returned without the group.

This Python script has two self-contained functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, that solve the problem of encoding and decoding a string with a cycle of three characters.
