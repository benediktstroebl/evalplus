This script defines a function encode_cyclic that takes a string s and returns an encoded version of the string. The script also defines a function decode_cyclic that takes an encoded string s as input and returns a decoded version of the string. The script then passes the test case for the decode_cyclic function by creating a string with the same content as the encode_cyclic function and then comparing it with the string returned from the encode_cyclic function.
