```python

    return "".join(g for g in s[::3] if len(g) == 3) + s[-3:]

This code defines a self-contained Python script that solves the given markdown code block problem. The encode_cyclic() function takes a string s as input and applies the encode_cyclic() function to it, which returns the encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. The decode_cyclic() function takes the encoded string s as input and returns the decoded string.
