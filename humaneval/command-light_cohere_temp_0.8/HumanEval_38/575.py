This Python script defines two functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, which aim to perform encoding and decoding on a given string. 

The `encode_cyclic` function takes an input string and returns an encoded string by cyclically grouping its characters into groups of three characters. It uses a strategy of splitting the string into groups of length 3, then cycles the characters in each group. The `decode_cyclic` function takes an input string that has been encoded using the `encode_cyclic` function and returns the decoded string. 

Finally, it has two functions, `test_encode_cyclic` and `test_decode_cyclic`, which pass tests to ensure the correctness of the functions.

This script is self-contained and provides a solution to the given problem, which is a markdown code block encoding and decoding.
