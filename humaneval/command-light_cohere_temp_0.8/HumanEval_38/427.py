This script defines a self-contained function for encoding and decoding markdown-like strings by cycling groups of three characters. The encode_cyclic function converts the input string into an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. The decoded_cyclic function takes the encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. The code is well-formatted, properly indented, and follows the coding style guidelines. It also includes appropriate comments and docstrings to explain the purpose and functionality of the functions.
