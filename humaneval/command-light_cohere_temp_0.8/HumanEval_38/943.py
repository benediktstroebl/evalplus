This Python script provides a self-contained function `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` that can encode and decode a string of markdown code, respectively. Each function splits the strings into groups of three characters and then cycles the elements in each group. 

These functions have also been tested to pass the corresponding tests.
