The script defines two functions:

1. `encode_cyclic(s: str)`: This function takes a string `s` as input and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. It uses a specific pattern to split the string into groups of length three, and then cycles the elements in each group. Then, it checks if the group has fewer elements than three and returns the string "".

2. `decode_cyclic(s: str)`: This function takes an input string `s` that was encoded using the `encode_cyclic` function and returns the decoded string. It simply uses the dry decode the string.

The code also provides test cases for both functions, which pass the tests. It shows that the functions can correctly encode and decode strings using the specified patterns.
