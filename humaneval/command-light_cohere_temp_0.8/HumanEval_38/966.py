This Python script includes a self-contained function called `encode_cyclic` that encodes a given string by cycling groups of three characters. It also has a `decode_cyclic` function that decodes this encoded string. This function uses the most string that contains multiple spaces, tabs, and other characters. This is a same as the function `encode_cyclic`, but with the added ability to handle multiple spaces. The tests ensure that functions work correctly and return the expected results.
