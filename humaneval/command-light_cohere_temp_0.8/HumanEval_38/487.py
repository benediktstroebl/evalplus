This code defines two functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, which are self-contained and solve the problem of encoding and decoding of a string, respectively.

The `encode_cyclic` function takes a string as input and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. The function splits the string into groups of length 3 and cycles elements in each group. The `decode_cyclic` function takes an encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

The code then passes tests to the functions, which verify that the functions are working correctly.
