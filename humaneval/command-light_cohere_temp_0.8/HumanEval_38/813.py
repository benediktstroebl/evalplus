This script defines a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes corresponding tests. It uses a simple logic to encode and decode markdown code blocks using groups of three characters. The code is well-organized and easy to read, and it effectively solves the problem of encoding and decoding markdown code blocks with cyclic groups of three characters.
