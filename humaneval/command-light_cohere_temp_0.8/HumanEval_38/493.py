``` 
This code defines a self-contained Python function called `encode_cyclic` that takes a string as input and returns the encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. This function splits the  the string into groups of length three and cycles the first character of each group with the second, and then appends the third. The function returns an empty string if the input string does not have a valid cycle. 

The code also defines a function called `decode_cyclic` that takes a string as input and returns the original decoded string. 
Finally, the code provides some test cases for the `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions, and the results are printed.
