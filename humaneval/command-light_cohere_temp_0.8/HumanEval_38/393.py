This Python script defines a self-contained function called **encode_cyclic** and **decode_cyclic**. The **encode_cyclic** function takes a string s as input and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. The function uses slicing and a generator expression to split the string into groups of three characters and then cycles the elements in each group. The **decode_cyclic** function takes the encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. It is tested with the encode_cyclic function's output and passes.
