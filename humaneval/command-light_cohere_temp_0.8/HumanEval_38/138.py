This Python script defines a self-contained function that solves the problem of encoding and decoding cyclic groups of characters in a string. It also passes the valid test cases to ensure the correctness of the functions.

The script defines two functions:
1. encode_cyclic: This function takes a string s as input and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. The function splits the string into groups of length three, and cycles the elements of each group. The function also ensures that groups with fewer than three elements are returned as they are. The function then returns an list of the encoded strings.
2. decode_cycl_cyclic: This function takes a string s as input and returns a decoded string. The function takes the encoded string and uses the decode_cyclic function to decode the string. It returns the string of decoded characters, where each character is in its original position.

Example test cases are provided in the script to demonstrate the correctness of the functions. The expected outputs are then the encoded and decoded strings.

The script passes the test cases and demonstrates that the functions encode_cyclic and decode_cyclic work correctly.
