```

This script provides a self-contained function that solves the problem and passes all the corresponding tests. It defines the two functions: `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`. The `encode_cyclic` function encodes the string by cycling groups of three characters. The `decode_cyclic` function takes the encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. 

This solution is self-contained, and it does not require any external functions or classes. It is in a format that is easy to test, and the tests pass without any issues.
