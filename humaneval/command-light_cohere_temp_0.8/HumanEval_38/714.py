The code defines a function `encode_cyclic` that encodes a string by cycling groups of three characters. The function splits the string into groups of three characters and then cycles the elements in each group. The function also handles the case where a group has fewer elements than three by returning the group as a single character. The code also defines a function `decode_cyclic` that takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. It does this by passing the test cases to the `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions and returns the decoded string.
