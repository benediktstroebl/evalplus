This script defines two functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, which are used to encode and decode a string, respectively. In the `encode_cyclic` function, the input string is converted into a list of lists, with each list containing three consecutive characters. The list is then joined back into a string, with the first character of each list removed. The `decode_cyclic` function takes the input string and the `encode_cyclic` function as arguments. It then asserts that the string was correctly encoded and returns the decoded string.
