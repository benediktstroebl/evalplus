This Python code defines a self-contained function called encode_cyclic and another function called decode_cyclic. The encode_cyclic function takes a string s as input and returns an encoded version of the string. The function works by splitting the string into groups of three characters, where each group is of length 3. The function then cycles through each group, except for the case where the group has fewer than three elements, in which case it only returns the first character of the group. The decode_cyclic function takes an string s as input and returns a decoded version of the string. The function works by taking the input string and using the encode_cyclic function to create an encoded version of the string. 

Finally, this code can be used to encode and decode markdown content.
