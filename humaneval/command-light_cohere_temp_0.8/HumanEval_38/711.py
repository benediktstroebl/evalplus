This script defines a function called encode_cyclic, which takes an input string s and returns an encoded string. This encoded string is encoded, it cycles groups of three characters in the string. The function achieves this by splitting the input string into groups of three characters, and then cycling each group of three characters. The last step is to handle the case where the group has fewer elements than three. Finally, the function returns a decoded string, which is the original input string without any encoding applied.

Here's the code:
```python
def encode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters
    """
    # split string to groups of three
    groups = [sub[i:j for i,j in enumerate(s) if i + j == 3]]
    # cycle elements in each group
    groups = [(group[1:] + group[0]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups)

def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    same provides the winners are the only 3 characters.
    """
    return s.split('... winners')

This script defines a self-contained function called encode_cyclic that takes an input string s and returns an encoded string. The encoded string is created by splitting the input string into groups of three characters and then cycling each group of three characters. The function also handles the case where the group has fewer elements than three. The function finally returns a decoded string, which is the original input string without any encoding applied.

The script also defines a function called decode_cyclic that takes an input string s and returns the
