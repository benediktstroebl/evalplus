This Python code defines a self-contained function for encoding and decoding strings by cycling groups of three characters. It uses two functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, each tested with sample inputs. The `encode_cyclic` function takes a string as input and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. The `decode_cyclic` function takes an encoded string as input and returns a decoded string. Both functions use nested loops to iterate over the input string, creating groups of three characters. They then join the strag groups back together to form the decoded string. The `decode_cyclic` function also performs a test to ensure that the decoded string is the same as the original input string.
