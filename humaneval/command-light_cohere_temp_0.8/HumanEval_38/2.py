This Python script defines a self-contained function `encode_cyclic` that converts a given string into an encoded format by cycling groups of three characters. The `decode_cyclic` function is designed to reverse this encoding process, and it takes the encoded string as input and returns the original decoded string. The test cases ensure that the functions behave as expected and provide the desired output.
