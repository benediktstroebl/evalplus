This Python code defines a function called `encode_cyclic` and another one called `decode_cyclic`. The `encode_cyclic` function takes a string as input and performs an encoding process on it. It creates a string of substrings, each consisting of three characters and separated by spaces. The `decode_cyclic` function is used to reverse this encoding process and return the original decoded string.
