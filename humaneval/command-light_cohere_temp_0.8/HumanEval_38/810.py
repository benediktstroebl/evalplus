```python
def encode_cyclic(s: str) -> str:

    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters
    The output string is encoded by replacing the first character by (asterisks or numbers) 
    and the last character by the second character of the last group.
    First, the string is split into groups of length 3, and then elements of each group are cycled.
    Then string is then decoded, with the first character being replaced by (asterisks or numbers), and the last character being replaced by the second character of the last group.
    Tested with a given string.

    note
    string is encoded by replacing the first character by (asterisks or numbers) 
    and the last character by the second character of the last group.
    The string is decoded, with the first character being replaced by the original character, and the last character being replaced by the second character.

This script defines a function `encode_cyclic` that encodes a string by cycling groups of three characters, and a function `decode_cyclic` that decodes the string. It also includes two test cases for the functions: one that tests the encoding function with a sample string and the other that tests the decoding function with a sample string.
