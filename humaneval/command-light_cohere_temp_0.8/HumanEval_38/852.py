This code defines a function called `encode_cyclic` that takes a string as input and returns an encoded version of the string. The function then breaks down the string into groups of three characters, and then cycles through each group to encode the string. Finally, the `decode_cyclic` function is defined to take an encoded string as input and return the decoded version of the string. The test block verifies that the correctness of the `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions by comparing the output of each function with the corresponding input. 
This code is self-contained and does not require any external functions or modules to pass the test.
