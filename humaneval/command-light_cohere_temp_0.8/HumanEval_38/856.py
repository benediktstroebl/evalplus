The provided code defines a self-contained function to encode and decode markdown code using the technique of encoding and decoding through cycling groups of three characters. The test function tests this code, which creates a test string and passes it through the encode_cyclic and decode_cyclic functions. The test passes the expected output, demonstrating the correctness of the functions.

The code is well-structured and follows good coding practices. It uses descriptive function and variable names, which improves readability and understandability. The comments added to the code provide additional context and explanation of the purpose and behavior of each function.
