This Python code defines a pair of functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, that solve a problem related to encoding and decoding of a special type of character string. The code uses three test cases to verify that the functions produce the correct output, which is the original string. 

The code is well-structured and follows a clear format, with comments explaining the purpose of each function and the test cases. It's a way to solve this problem and pass the tests, making it a useful and self-contained solution.
