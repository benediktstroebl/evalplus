This Python script defines a self-contained function called `encode_cyclic` and another function called `decode_cyclic` that both pass the test. 
The `encode_cyclic` function takes a string `s` as input and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. The `decode_cyclic` function takes an input string `s` and returns the decoded string.
