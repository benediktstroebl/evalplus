This Python code defines a function `encode_cyclic` that converts a string into an encoded format by cycling groups of three characters. The function splits the string into groups of three characters, cycles the elements within each group, and joins the elements back together to form a single string.

The function `decode_cyclic` is defined to take an encoded string as input and return a decoded string. The function uses the `encode_cyclic` function to encode the input string and then calls the `decode_cyclic` function with the encoded string as an argument.

The code includes tests to verify the correctness of the `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions. The tests pass the result of `encode_cyclic` for strings with lengths 3, 4, and 5, and the result of `decode_cyclic` matches the original string for these inputs.
