This Python code defines a pair of functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, that together solve and verify a specific encoding and decoding problem. The `encode_cyclic` function takes a string `s` as input and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. It achieves this by splitting the string into groups of length 3, cycling elements within each group, and then joining the groups back together to form the original string. The `decode_cyclic` function takes an input string `s` that was encoded with `encode_cyclic` and returns the decoded string. It uses a mate: unencoded string of each group of length 3, grouping together groups of characters using the same rules as `encode_cyclic` function.
