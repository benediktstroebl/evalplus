This code defines a set of functions to encode and decode strings using a cyclic encoding technique. The encode_cyclic function splits the input string into groups of three characters, and then cycles through the characters in each group. The decoded_cyclic function uses the encode_cyclic to encode the input string and then returns the decoded string.
