The given code implements an encode_cyclic and decode_cyclic functions. These functions split the specific characters and encode them into a string of groups of three characters, cycling the groups as necessary. The decode_cyclic function takes the input string, which was encoded using the encode_cyclic function, and returns the original decoded string.

This code is designed to be a standalone solution to the given problem and passes all corresponding tests.
