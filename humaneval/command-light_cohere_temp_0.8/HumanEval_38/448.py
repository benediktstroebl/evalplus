```
The code defines a function `encode_cyclic` that takes a string as input and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. The function splits the string into groups of length three and cycles the characters in each group. The function `decode_cyclic` takes an input string and returns the decoded string. It uses the `encode_cyclic` to encode the input string and then applies the decoding operation. The code also provides test cases to verify the correctness of the functions.

These functions demonstrate a self-contained solution to the given problem.
