This script defines two functions: `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, which implement the encoding and decoding functionality described in the prompt. Additionally, the script includes two test functions (`test_encode_cyclic` and `test_decode_cyclic`) that verify the correctness of the functions.

This Python script can be used to encode and decode markdown code blocks, and it passes all the corresponding tests.
