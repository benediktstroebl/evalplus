The code defines two functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`. The `encode_cyclic` function encodes a string by cycling groups of three characters. The `decode_cyclic` function takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. The code then creates test cases for both functions and passes them to pass the corresponding tests.
