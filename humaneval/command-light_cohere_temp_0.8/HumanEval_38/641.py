This Python script defines two functions, encode_cyclic and decode_cyclic, that solve the encoding and decoding of a string with a cyclic group of three characters problem. The encode_cyclic function splits the input string into groups of three characters, cycles the characters within each group, and then concatenates the groups to form the encoded string. The decode_cyclic function takes the encoded string as input and returns the decoded string, using a similar split and concatenate logic.
