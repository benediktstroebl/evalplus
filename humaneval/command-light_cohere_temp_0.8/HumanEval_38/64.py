This Python script contains two self-contained functions: `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`. The `encode_cyclic` function encodes a string by cycling groups of three characters. The `decode_cyclic` function takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. 

The script then passes these functions with various input strings and prints the results to the console to ensure that the functions are working as expected.
