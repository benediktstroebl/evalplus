This script defines a function called `encode_cyclic` that takes a string `s` as input and returns an encoded version of it. The string is split into groups of three characters, and each group is concatenated with the group's first character. Then, the encoded string is built by joining the encoded groups back together. The function `decode_cyclic` takes the encoded string as input and returns the original decoded string. The test function verifies that the correctness of the `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions by comparing the output of each with the corresponding input.

This code provides a self-contained solution to the given problem and passes all the tests. It takes the `s` input string and returns the `encoded` version of the string by cycling groups of three characters. Then, the `decoded` version of the string is returned by the `decode_cyclic` function.
