``` 
This Python code defines a self-contained function for encoding and decoding strings based on a cyclic property. The encode_cyclic function splits the input string into groups of three characters and then cycles the elements within each group. The decode_cyclic function does the opposite by applying a lambda function that removes the leading character from each group. 

These functions are then tested with various input strings and output values to ensure they produce the expected decoded strings.
