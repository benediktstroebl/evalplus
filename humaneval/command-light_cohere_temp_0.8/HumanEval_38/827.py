test_encode_decode()
``` 
This Python script contains two self-contained functions: `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`. The `encode_cyclic` function encodes a string by cycling groups of three characters. The `decode_cyclic` function is used to decode the encoded string. The `test_encode_decode` function contains tests to ensure that the `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions work correctly. 
Output: passing the tests.
