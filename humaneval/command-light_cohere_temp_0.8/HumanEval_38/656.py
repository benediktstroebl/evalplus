This Python script defines two self-contained functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, that efficiently solve the problem of encoding and decoding of a string using cyclic groups of three characters. The `test` function demonstrates the use of these functions with a sample string, and passes the test by comparing the result of `encode_cyclic` with the expected decoded string.
