This Python script presents a self-contained function that addresses the given problem and passes the corresponding tests. It defines two functions, encode_cyclic and decode_cyclic, which handle encoding and decoding of a string using the concept of cycling groups of three characters. The encode_cyclic function splits the input string into groups of three characters, then cycles the characters within each group. The decoded string is then obtained by applying the encode_cyclic function again on the result of the decoding process. The test cases validate the function behavior, ensuring accurate encoding and decoding.
