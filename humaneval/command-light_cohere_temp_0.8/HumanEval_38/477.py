Here's a self-contained Python function that encodes and decodes a given string using the encode_cyclic and decode_cyclic functions:
```python
def encode_cyclic(s: str) -> str:
    """
    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.
    # split string to groups Each of length 3
    groups = s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)
    # cycle elements in each group
    groups = [(group[1:] + group[0]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups)

def decode_cyclic(s: str) -> str:
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    stran't be decrypted easily as you have with other cyclic paddings.
    # just reverse each group of elements
    # e.g. l. (start with 0 and
    can reverse each element 
    # by adding it to the end
    # then removing the last character
    # and adding 1 to the next character)
    # then removing the last character and so on.
    return = s[1:] + s[0]
    return s
```
The encode_cyclic function splits the input string into groups of three characters each, then cycles each group element. The decode_cyclic function takes the encoded string and reverses the group elements to decode the string.
