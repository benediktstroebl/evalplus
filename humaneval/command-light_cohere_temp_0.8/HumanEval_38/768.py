    """
    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters
    We split the string into groups of length 3, then cycle elements in each group. We use a specific case: if the length of the group is 3, we add the first character to the last one, then repeat the rest.
    """return "".join(groups)


def decode_cyclic(s: str):

```
The purpose of this script is to define a self-contained function that takes a string as input and returns a decoded string. The encode_cyclic function is used to encode a string by cycling groups of three characters, and the decode_cyclic function is used to take the encoded string as input and return a decoded string.
