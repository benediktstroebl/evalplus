This Python script defines two functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, which are used to encode and decode strings, respectively. The encode_cyclic function splits the input string into groups of three characters and cycles through the characters within each group. The decoded_cyclic function then reassembles the encoded string back into a decoded string by replacing the encoded characters with their corresponding decoded characters. 

This self-contained code provides a complete solution and test for the given problem.
