The code defines two functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, which are self-contained and solve the given problem. The `test_encode_cyclic` and `test_decode_cyclic` functions are used to check if the functions are working correctly.

Finally, the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ensures that the test cases are executed when the script is run directly. 

This code provides a complete solution and test cases for the given problem.
