Here is a self-contained Python script with a function that solves the problem of encoding and decoding markdown code:

```python
def encode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters
    """
    return "".join(groups)

def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    essential decoded string
   
    """

# Test cases
tests = [
    "**encode****, "hello world",
    "**decode**", "hello #0123456789",
    "**encode**", "123_abc",
    "**decode**", "123abc",
    "**decode**", "____________________________________",
    "**encode**", "This is a test.",
    "**decode_cyclic**", "__________"
]

for t in tests:
    print(f"{t} -> {encode_cyclic(t)} -> {decode_cyclic(t)}")
```

This script defines two functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, which solve the problem of encoding and decoding markdown code. The output of the result of these functions should match the given test cases.
