This code defines a function encode_cyclic that converts a string to a Markdown-like encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. The code also defines a decode_cyclic function that takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. 

Note that this code is a good starting point, but you can continue to enhance and refine it to match the requirements of your problem and improve readability and maintainability.
