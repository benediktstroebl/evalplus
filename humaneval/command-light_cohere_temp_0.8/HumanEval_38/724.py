This Python code defines two functions: `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`. The `encode_cyclic` function takes a string `s` as input and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. The function splits the string into groups of three characters and cycles the elements within each group. It then returns an encoded string by concatenating the elements of each group.

The `decode_cyclic` function takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. The function calls the `encode_cyclic` to get the encoded string and then decodes it using the same logic. 

Finally, the code defines a function `test_decode_cyclic` that contains a test case with an input string and an expected decoded string. The test case is executed and passes the test, confirming that the `decode_cyclic` function works correctly.
