This code defines a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of encoding and decoding markdown code. The encode_cyclic function splits the input string into groups of three characters, cycles the groups, and returns the encoded string. The decode_cyclic function takes the encoded string and matches the brightness of dark marks and bright marks. It returns the dark mark and bright mark in the original string. The code provides corresponding tests to ensure the correctness of the functions.

Overall, the code is well-structured and follows good practices. It efficiently solves the pattern matching problems using group cycling and character matching.
