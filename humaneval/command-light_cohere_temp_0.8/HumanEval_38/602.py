This Python script provides a self-contained solution to the problem and passes all the test cases.  It contains two functions: encode_cyclic and decode_cyclic, which solve the encoding and decoding of a cyclic group of three characters. It also contains a test_encode_decode function that contains various test cases for both functions to ensure their correctness.
