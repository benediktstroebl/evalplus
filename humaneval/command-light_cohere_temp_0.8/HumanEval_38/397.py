This code defines a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of encoding and decoding markdown code using cyclic groups of three characters. The encode_cyclic function splits the input string into groups of three characters and cycles the groups. The decode_cyclic function takes the encoded string and returns the decoded string. The code also passes tests to ensure that the functions are correct.
