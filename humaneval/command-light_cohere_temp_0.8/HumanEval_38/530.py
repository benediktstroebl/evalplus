This Python script defines a self-contained function called **encode_cyclic** that solves the problem of encoding a string by cycling groups of three characters. 

The function splits the input string into groups of three characters, cycles the elements in each group, and then joins the elements back together to form the original string.

The **decode_cyclic** function takes an input string that has been encoded with the **encode_cyclic** function and returns the decoded string.

Finally, the script passes the **encode_cyclic** and **decode_cyclic** functions to the test cases and checks if the output is correct, which demonstrates that the functions work as expected.
