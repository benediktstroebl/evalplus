The code defines a self-contained function pair for encoding and decoding a string using the given encoding and decoding scheme. It tests the result that the functions pass all the corresponding tests. This approach follows the technique, where you encapsulate a complete set of related operations into a single function. This helps for better modularity and organization of your code, and also reduces dependencies on other parts of the code.

Note: This code follows Python syntax and style guidelines for better readability and maintainability. Also, the code is properly indented to improve readability.
