```python
def encode_cyclic(s: str) -> str:
    """
    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters
    """
    return "".join(groups) 

def decode_cyclic(s: str) -> str:
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    depends guaranteed to return decoded string.
    """

Note: The 'encode_cyclic' and 'decode_cyclic' functions do not use the 'return' statement, but they could be used as methods with 'return' statement.
