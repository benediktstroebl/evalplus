This script defines a function `encode_cyclic` that returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters, and a function `decode_cyclic` that takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. The last function passes all the test cases provided and the output is the decoded string, which is the exact copy of the input.
