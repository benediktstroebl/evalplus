This Python script defines a self-contained function, `encode_cyclic`, which takes a string `s` as input and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. The function then creates a list of groups, each with a length of three characters, and cycles the characters in each group. The function then checks if the list has fewer elements than three, and returns the list if it does. The function also checks if the list has three elements and returns the first and last character of the group.

The second function, `decode_cyclic`, takes a string `s` as input and returns the original decoded string. The function then checks if the input string is the encoded string that it should be.

Finally, the script tests the functions by calling them with the input strings "Hello World!" and the expected output is printed. The output of the functions should be the decoded string "Hello World!"  which is the original string with its encoding removed.
