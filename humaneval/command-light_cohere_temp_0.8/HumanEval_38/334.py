The encode_cyclic and decode_cyclic functions solve the problem. They take a code blocks with descriptive and helpful docstrings. The encode_cyclic function splits the input string into groups of length 3 and cycles the characters in each group. The decode_cyclic function takes the encoded string as input and calls the encode_cyclic function to get the decoded string.
