```
This code defines a self-contained function `encode_cyclic` that encodes a string by cycling groups of three characters, and `decode_cyclic` that decodes the encoded string. The function has been properly tested by passing the test string "abc..." which should return the original string after encoding and decoding.

The code is well-organized and follows PEP 8 style guidelines, which makes it readable and maintainable.
