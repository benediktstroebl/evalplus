Here is a Python script that includes the self-contained function **encode_cyclic** and its tests:
```python
def encode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.
    """
    # split string to groups Each of length 3.
    groups = s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s)) for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    # cycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
    groups = [(group[1:] + group[0]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups)

def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.
    """
   

    see encode_cyclic function to understand the encoding.
# test case
    assert encode_cyclic("hello") == "h...ol"
    # another test
    assert encode_cyclic("world") == "w...dl"
```
