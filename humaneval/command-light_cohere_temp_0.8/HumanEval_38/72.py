This code defines a self-contained function that solves the given problem.  It takes astring contains two functions: encode_cyclic and decode_cyclic. The encode_cyclic function takes an input string s and returns an encoded string. The encoded string is obtained by cycling groups of three characters from the input string. The decoded string is then returned by the decode_cyclic function, which takes the encoded string as input and returns the decoded string.
