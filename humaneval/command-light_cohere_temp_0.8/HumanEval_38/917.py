This Python script defines a self-contained function that solves the given markdown encoding/decoding problem. The function encode_cyclic converts a given string s to a markdown encoded string. The function then, decode_cyclic, converts the input string back to the original decoded string. The script also passes a tests to ensure the correctness of the functions.
