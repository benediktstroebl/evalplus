This Python code defines a pair of functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, that are used to encode and decode a string containing only the characters 'abc'. The `encode_cyclic` function takes a string as input and returns an encoded string where each group of three characters is repeated. The `decode_cyclic` function takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. It uses a simple techniques to solve the problem of encoding and decoding a string containing only 'abc' characters.
