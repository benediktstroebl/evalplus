This code contains two self-contained functions: `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`. The `encode_cyclic` function splits a string into groups of three characters and cycles each group. The `decode_cyclic` function takes an encoded string and decodes it. The test cases ensure that the functions are correctly defined and produce the expected results.
