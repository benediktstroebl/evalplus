This script defines a function `encode_cyclic` that takes a string as input and returns an encoded string. The function splits the string into groups of length 3 and cycles the characters in each group. The function also ensures that the encoded string does not have more than three characters in each group. 

The script also defines a function `decode_cyclic` that takes an encoded string as input and returns a decoded string. The function converts the string into groups and checks that the code is in the right range. 

This script can be used to encode and decode strings with cycling groups of three characters, and passes all tests.
