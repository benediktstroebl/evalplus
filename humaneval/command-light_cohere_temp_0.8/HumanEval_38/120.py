The script defines a self-contained function `encode_cyclic` that takes a string as input and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. The function splits the string into groups of length 3 and cycles the elements of each group. The `decode_cyclic` function takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. It does this by reversing the encoding process and returns the original string.
