This code defines a self-contained Python script that contains two functions:
- The `encode_cyclic` function receives a string and returns an encoded version. It splits the string into groups of three characters and cycles the first character of each group. Then, it returns the string formed by these groups.
- The `decode_cyclic` function takes an encoded string and returns the decoded version. It simply returns the this original string, as it is already encoded with the `encode_cyclic` function.

The code is well-contained and self-contained, as it has no external dependencies or import statements.
