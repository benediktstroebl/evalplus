This Python script defines two functions: encode_cyclic and decode_cyclic. The encode_cyclic function takes a string as input and returns an encoded version of the string, by splitting it into groups of three characters and then encoding each group by cycling its elements. The second function, the decode_cyclic, takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded version of the string. The script also contains several assert statements that check the correctness of the functions, such as the input and output of the functions and the behavior of the functions with different input strings.
