This Python script defines a self-contained function `encode_cyclic` that takes a string as input and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. It then defines another function `decode_cyclic` that takes an encoded string as input and returns a decoded string. The code passes all tests using the strings and the `assert` statement, which ensures the correctness of the functions.
