This function solves the problem of encoding and decoding a string of characters into a cyclic pattern of groups of three characters. The function splits the string into groups of three characters, and then cycles through each group. The function ensures that the groups have at least three characters, and the cycle is applied to each group. The encoded string is then returned.
