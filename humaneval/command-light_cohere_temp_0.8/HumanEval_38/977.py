    test cases.
    # first test the local test case:
    test_string = "aaaaaa"
    assert decode_cyclic(encode_cyclic(test_string)) == test_string
    # second test case

    ```

This code defines the `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions, which are self-contained and solve the problem. Both the functions take an input string and return the decoded string. The `test_string` variable is used to provide the first test case, which passes the test by comparing the output of the `encode_cyclic` function with the original string.
