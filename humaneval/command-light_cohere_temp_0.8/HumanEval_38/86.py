This script provides a self-contained solution to the problem, along with passing corresponding tests. The code is well-structured, and the functions are named to clearly indicate their functionality. The `test_str` variable holds the input string that is passed to the `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions to test their functionality.
