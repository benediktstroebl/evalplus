The provided Python script defines a self-contained function called `encode_cyclic` and another function called `decode_cyclic`. The `encode_cyclic` function is designed to take a string as input and return an encoded version of the string. The `decode_cyclic` function is designed to take an encoded string as input and return the decoded version of the string.

Both functions are intended to pass their corresponding tests, which are designed to verify the correctness of the functions.

Please note that this code snippet is designed to solve the problem of encoding and decoding a string using a cyclical group of three characters. This code can be easily understood and modified to suit your specific requirements or application.
