This Python script includes two self-contained functions: `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`. The `encode_cyclic` function encodes the input string by cycling groups of three characters. The `decode_cyclic` function, on the other hand, decodes the input string by taking the encoded string as input and returning the decoded string. The test cases for these function pass successfully, demonstrating that the function is self-contained and effectively solves the given problem.
