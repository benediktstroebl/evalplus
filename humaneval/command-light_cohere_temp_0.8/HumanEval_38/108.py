    example, if it's a valid encoded string it will return a decoded string.

This code defines a self-contained function that solves the given problem. It splits the string into groups of length 3, cycles elements in each group, and then joins the elements back together to form the original string. The function also passes the tests to verify its correctness. The code then creates two test strings and passes them to the functions to check if they return the expected decoded strings.
