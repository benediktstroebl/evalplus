This code defines two functions, encode_cyclic and decode_cyclic, which are used to encode and decode a string containing only the characters 'abc'. These functions split the input string into groups of three characters and then cycle the characters in each group. If the group has fewer characters than three, then the first character of the group is repeated before the group is returned. The output of these functions is the decoded string, which is the original input string with the characters 'abc' removed.

This code is a good example of a self-contained function that solves a specific problem and passes all corresponding tests. It is an useful tool for encoding and decoding strings in a specific pattern.
