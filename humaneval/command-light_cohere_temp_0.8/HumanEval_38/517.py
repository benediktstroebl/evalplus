This Python code defines two functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, which are designed to convert a given string into a sequence of groups of three characters and then back into the original string, respectively.

The `encode_cyclic` function splits the input string into groups of three characters, where each group is a sequence of consecutive characters. The function then returns a resulting encoded string, where each group of three characters is joined together with the first character of the group and the first character of the original string. 

The `decode_cyclic` function takes the input encoded string and returns the original decoded string. The function works by taking the input string and calling the `encode_cyclic` function to get the encoded string. 

The code also provides a set of test cases to verify the correctness of the `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions.
