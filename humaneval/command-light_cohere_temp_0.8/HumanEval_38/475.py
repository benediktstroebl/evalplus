    problem test the result:
    - The encode_cyclic function takes a string s as input and returns the encoded version of the string.

- The encode_cyclic function splits the string into groups of three characters. It does this by creating a loop that iterates through each substring of length 3 and uses the range notation to extract a substring of length 3 from the original string.

- The function then cycles the characters in each group. It does this by using a list comprehension to select the characters from the beginning of each group and appends these characters to the end of the group.

- The function then uses a conditional statement to handle the case where a group has fewer characters than three. In this case, it returns the group as is to ensure that the group is still a valid three-character group.

- The encode_cyclic function returns the encoded version of the original string.

- The decode_cyclic function takes a string s as input and returns the decoded version of the string. It uses the same function to encode the string and then performs the inverse operation of the encode_cyclic function to decode the string.
