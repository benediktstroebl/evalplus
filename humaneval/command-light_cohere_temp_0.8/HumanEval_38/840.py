This code defines a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of encoding and decoding a string of repeating characters. It also passes the the test cases that the function is correct.

It defines two functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, that solve the problem. These functions take a The input string and return the encoded or decoded string, respectively. The test cases check that the `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions are working correctly by passing the expected results for the input strings.
