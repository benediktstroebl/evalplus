This Python script defines a function called `encode_cyclic` that takes a string as input and returns an encoded version of the string. The `encode_cyclic` function splits the input string into substrings of length 3 and then cycles through each group. The `decode_cyclic` function takes an encoded string as input and returns the original decoded string. The script also includes a function called `decode_cyclic` that takes an encoded string as input and returns the original decoded string, which the `encode_cyclic` function returns. 
This script then passes the functions to the `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions to test their functionality. The encoded string is equal to the original string passed to the `encode_cyclic` function, which confirms the correctness of the functions.
