Here's the code's functionality:

- The **encode_cyclic** function encodes a given string by cycling groups of three characters. It splits the string into groups of three characters and cycles each group. If a group has fewer elements than three, it adds the first character to the end of the string.
- The **decode_cyclic** function takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. It uses the **encode_cyclic** function to decode the string.

- The **decode_encode_cyclic** function is a utility function that takes an input string and returns the decoded string, which matches the behavior of the **encode_cyclic** function.

The code is well-organized and follows good coding practices. It is also includes docstrings to provide clear documentation of the purpose and functionality of each function.
