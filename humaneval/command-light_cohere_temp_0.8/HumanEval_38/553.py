```
The code defines a self-contained function that solves the problem of encoding and decoding a string with circular groups of three characters. The encode_cyclic function takes a string as input and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. The decoded_cyclic function takes the encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. It is also rely on any external functions or classes.
