The code includes two functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, which encode and decode markdown code blocks. The `encode_cyclic` function splits the input string into groups of three characters and cycles the groups. The `decode_cyclic` function is the reverse of the encoding process and returns the original decoded string. 

The code also includes a function `test_encode_decode` with several tests to verify the correctness of the functions. The code passes all tests and all the assertions are checked, and the code works as expected.
