The Python script provided defines a function `make_palindrome` that constructs a palindrome of a given string. 

The function uses a simple algorithm to find the shortest palindrome by locating the longest postfix for the input string that is also a palindrome. 

The function then appends the reversed string prefix to the end of the original string to create the palindrome. 

This self-contained function showcases a straightforward approach to solving the palindrome problem in Python, and it passes all the provided test cases.
