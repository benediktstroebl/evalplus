This Python code defines a function `make_palindrome`, which generates the shortest palindrome that starts with a given string.

```python
def is_palindrome(string):
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string):
    if not:  # handle empty string
        return ""
    if len(string) == 1:  # base case: single character string is already a palindrome
        return string
    
    # find the longest palindrome
    palindrome = ""
    for char in string:
        if palindrome == "" or char == palindrome[-1]:
            palindrome += char
        else:
            palindrome = char + palindrome[::-1]
    
    return palindrome
```
This code has a function `make_palindrome` that creates the shortest palindrome for a given string. The function starts with an if statement to handle empty strings, then it returns an empty string. If the input string is not empty, it then checks if the string has only one character, returning it as the shortest palindrome. For longer strings, the function uses a for loop to find the longest palindrome. It iterates over each characters in the input string and checks if the current character is equal to the reverse of the last character added to the `palindrome` string. If the character matches, it is appended to the string.
