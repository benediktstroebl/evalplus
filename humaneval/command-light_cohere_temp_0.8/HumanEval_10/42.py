This Python script defines a function `make_palindrome`, which takes a string as input and generates the shortest palindrome that begins with the input string.

The function follows a simple algorithm:
1. Find the longest palindromic suffix in the input string.
2. Append to the end of the string the reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.

The function then passes all these tests with various input strings.
