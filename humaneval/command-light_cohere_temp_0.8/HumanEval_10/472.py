A solution is a palindrome. The script defines a function that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the input string is a palindrome or not. 

The function uses a simple algorithm that first finds the longest palindrome substring in the input string and then reverses the characters of that substring to create the reverse of the palindrome. 

The function then appends the reversed substring to the beginning of the input string, effectively creating the palindrome. 

The following is an explanation with code for the function:
```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    return string == string[::-1]
```
The `is_palindrome` function checks whether the given string is a palindrome or not. It achieves this by comparing the string with its reverse. The result is a True value, indicating that the input string is a palindrome, as it equals the reversed version of the string.
