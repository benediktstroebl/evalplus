Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem of creating a palindrome of a given string:
```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.

    # Algorithm idea simple:
    # Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    # Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.

    return string + urlparse('').replace('	',' ') for a single space.  # Split the one or longest palindrome and change all other single spaces to a single space.
```

This function takes a string as input and returns a palindrome of the string. It uses a single space to replace all other single spaces in the string, which is a common technique to create a palindrome.
