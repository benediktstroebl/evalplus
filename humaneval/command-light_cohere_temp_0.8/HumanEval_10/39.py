The solution is a palindrome, a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same forward and backward. This can be easily achieved by the process of removing all the characters except the ones that appear in both forward and backward iterations. 

The following Python code creates a self-contained function that solves the problem:
```python
def is_palindrome(string):
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string):
    if not_palindrome(string):
        return ""
    return make_palindrome(string[::-1:]) + string[::-1][::-1:]

def not_palindrome(string):
    return "Yes, it is a palindrome!" if is_palindrome(string)
```

The code defines two functions: `is_palindrome` and `make_palindrome`. The `is_palindrome` function returns True if the string is a palindrome and False otherwise. The `make_palindrome` function finds the shortest palindrome that begins with the string. The `make_palindrome` function works by creating a new string that contains the first half of the reversed string and the second half of the reversed string. This is string is reversed. The function then appends the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix to the string.
