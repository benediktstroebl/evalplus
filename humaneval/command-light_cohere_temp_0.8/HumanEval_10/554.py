```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    if not_palindrome(string):
        return 'fail'

    len_str = len(string)
    suffix = string[-1:]reverse()
    prefix = string[:-len(suffix)]

    return prefix + suffix
```

The code defines two functions:
1. `is_palindrome` — checks if a given string is a palindrome. It returns `True` if the string is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
2. `make_palindrome`—`— finds the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. It first calls the's palindrome is function to check if the string is a palindrome. If not, it returns `fail`. If it is, it then:
   - Calculates the length of the original string and determines the length of the longest palindrome suffix.
   - Creates a string prefix by removing the last character of the original string and reversing its last character.
   - Creates the string suffix by removing the first character of the palindrome and reversing its last character.
   - Constructs the str to be the palindrome by concatenating the prefix and suffix in reverse order.

The code effectively solves the problem of finding the shortest palindrome in a given string. 

The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
