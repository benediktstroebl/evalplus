This Python script defines a function make_palindrome that takes a string as input and returns the palindromic version of that string. It implements a algorithm by finding the longest palindrome substring and reversing it. 

Let's go through the code step by step:
1. **Function Definition**:
```python
def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
```
This line defines a function `make_palindrome` that takes a single argument `string`, which is expected to be a string.

2. **Function Logic**:
```python
	# Find the longest palindrome substring
	palindrome = []
	n = len(string)
	char = string[0]

	# Iterate through each character in the string
	for i in range(1, n):
		if char == string[i]:
			continue
		else:
			palindrome.append(char)
			char = string[i]

	# Reverse the palindrome
	palindrome.append(char[::-1])
	return ''.join(palindrome)
```
This algorithm works by iterating through each character in the input string. The `char` variable holds the character of the current position, while `palindrome` stores the characters of the longest palindrome substring.

3. **Testing**:
```python
# Testing
>>> make_palindrome('')
''
>>> make_palindrome('cat')
'catac'
>>> make_palindrome('cata')
'catac'
```

These are examples of calling the `make_palindrome` function with different input strings and verifying the returned strings are indeed palindromes.
