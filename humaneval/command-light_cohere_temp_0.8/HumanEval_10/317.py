The Python script you provided has a self-contained function `make_palindrome(string: str)` that solves the problem of finding the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. 

The function uses a simple algorithm to find the shortest palindrome. It first finds the The longest postfix of the supplied string that is a palindrome. Then, it appends to the end of the string the reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
