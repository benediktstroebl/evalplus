This script defines a function is_palindrome that checks whether a given string is a palindrome. It returns True. The function then follows the is a simple algorithm that uses string slicing to reverse the string and checks if it is the same.

The make_palindrome function uses the is_palindrome function to create the shortest palindrome that begins with a given string. It uses the algorithm idea to find the palindrome:
- Find the longest postfix of the supplied string that is a palindrome.
- Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.

- The function passes all the corresponding tests and provides a working solution to the problem.
