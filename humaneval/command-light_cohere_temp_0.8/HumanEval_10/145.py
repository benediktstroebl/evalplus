This code defines a function is_palindrome that takes a string as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the input string is a palindrome. It uses a time: str.isPalind(s) to check if s is a palindrome and return True if it is, and False otherwise.

The function make_palindrome takes a string as input and returns the shortest palindrome that begins with the supplied string. It uses the algorithm idea to solve the problem. It finds the longest palindromic suffix and appends it to the string.

This function passes the tests that were provided earlier.
