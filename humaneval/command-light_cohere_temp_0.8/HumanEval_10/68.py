This is an excellent solution to the problem! This Python function, `make_palindrome()`, takes a string as input and returns the shortest palindrome that begins with the input string. 

The function uses the following approach:
1. Find the longest postfix of the supplied string that is a palindrome.
2. Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix. 

This algorithm guarantees the creation of the shortest palindrome using only single characters from the original input string.
