A solution is a palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or sequence that reads the same forward and backward (clockwise or counterclockwise). A palindrome is a type of repetitive pattern.

A straightforward algorithm for producing a palindrome is as follows:
1. First, identify the longest postfix of the input string that reads the same backward and forward (palindrome).
2. Find the characters that prefix of the string that comes before the palindrome's suffix.
3. Append the reverse of the string to the beginning of the string.

Here is the code:
```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string
    Algorithm idea:
    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    >>> make_palindrome('')
    ''
    >>> make_palindrome('cat')
    'catac'
    >>> make_palindrome('cata')
    'catac'
    """
    return string[::-1]+string[:len(string)-len(string[::-1])]
```
