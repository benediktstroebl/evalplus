A solution to the Markdown code block problem has been crafted with a Python function that checks if a string is a palindrome, and also provides a function to generate a palindrome given a string.

Let's break down the solution:
```python
def is_palindrome(string):
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string):
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string"""
    if not string:
        return ""
    
    # Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome
    max_len = 0
    palindrome = ""
    for char in string:
        if is_palindrome(char):
            if len(palindrome) < max_len:
                max_len = len(palindrome)
                palindrome = char + palindrome[::-1]
            else:
                break
    
    return palindrome
```
The is_palindrome function uses the slicing operator to reverse the original string, ensuring that it is a palindrome. The make_palindrome function works similarly to the previous code, but with an additional check to find the longest palindromic prefix and append it to the reversed string.

This solution is self-contained and can be easily integrated into any project or used directly as provided.
