The Python script provided has a self-contained function `make_palindrome` that builds a palindrome given a string. The function works by finding the longest postfix of the string that is palindromic and then appending the reverse of this prefix to the end of the original string.

It uses the concept of palindromes to achieve the solution. 

The tests ensure that the function works correctly for a variety of inputs.
