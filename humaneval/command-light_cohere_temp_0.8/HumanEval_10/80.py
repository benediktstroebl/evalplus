The following Python function, MakePalindrome, takes a string as an input and creates a palindrome from it using a simple algorithm. The function checks if the string is empty, returns an empty string. If the string is not empty, the function finds the longest palindrome in the string and appends the reverse of that palindrome to the beginning of the string. The function tests if the shortest palindrome is successfully constructed.
