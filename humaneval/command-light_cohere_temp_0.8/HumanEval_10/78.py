Here's a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of finding the shortest palindrome for a given input string:
```python
def is_palindrome(string):
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string):
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
    
    Algorithm idea simple:
    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    
    Parameters:
    string (str): The input string
    
    Returns:
    str: The shortest palindrome that begins with str
```

The code has a self-contained function that takes a string as input and returns the shortest palindrome that begins with the input string. This can be used to test if the returned value is indeed a palindrome.
