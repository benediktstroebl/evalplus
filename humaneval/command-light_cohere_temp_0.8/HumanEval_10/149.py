The provided code includes a solution and test for the given problem. It defines the two functions:
- `is_palindrome` checks if a given string is a palindrome.
- `make_palindrome` creates a palindrome using the `is_palindrome` function. 

This code is a good example of a self-contained solution, and it passes the test cases without any external dependencies.
