The function `is_palindrome` checks if a given string is a palindrome. It returns `True` for valid palindromes and `False` otherwise. The function `make_palindrome` finds the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. The function works by:
- Finding the longest postfix of the supplied string that is a palindrome.
- Appending the end of the string with the reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.

The function uses string manipulation and basic algorithms, and it passes all the tests provided.
