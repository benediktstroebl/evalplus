This Python function, `make_palindrome`, efficiently constructs the shortest palindrome using dynamic programming:
```python
def make_palindrome(string):
    n = len(string)
    if n <= 1:
        return string

    # Find the length of palindrome
    m = 1
    while m < n // 2:
        m += 1
    palindrome_length = m

    # Find the palindrome
    palindrome = string[:palindrome_length]
    reverse_char = string[-palindrome_length:]
    palindrome += reverse_char * palindrome_length

    return palindrome
```
This function takes a string as input and efficiently constructs a palindrome by using dynamic programming. It iterates through idea is to find the length of the palindrome and then construct the palindrome using the string prefix and reverse of the remaining characters. The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
