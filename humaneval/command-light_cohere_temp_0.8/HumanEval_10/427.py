The provided Python script contains a self-contained function that efficiently solves the problem of finding the shortest palindrome that begins with a given string.

Let's break down the code:
```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
    
    # Algorithm idea:
    # Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome
    # Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix
    
    if notstring:  # empty string
        return ''
    else:
        l = len(string)
        while l:
            r = l - 1
            if is_palindrome(string[r:l]) == True:
                return string[:r] + string[::-1][l-r:l]
            l = l - 1
    return string
```

This script defines a function `is_palindrome` that checks if a given string is a palindrome. It then defines another function `make_palindrome` that constructs the shortest palindrome for a given string. The algorithm uses a strategy of finding the longest palindromic postfix of the string and then constructing the palindrome by appending the reverse of a palindromic prefix to the end of the string. 

The code is well-designed and self-contained, providing a solution to the problem in a clear and concise manner.
