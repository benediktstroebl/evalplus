Here's the provided solution to the problem:

```python
def is_palindrome(string):
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string):
    """
    Returns the shortest palindrome that begins with the string.
    This idea is simple:
    - Find the longest palindrome substring.
    - Return the Palindrome by appending the reverse of the prefix.
    - Return the string as the result.
    """
    string = ''.join(string) 
    return string[::-1] + string[-1:]
```

This solution utilizes the concept of string reversibility to create a palindrome. It iterates over the next, the prefix is reversed and added to the beginning of the original string, effectively constructing a palindrome.
