```python
def is_palindrome(string): 
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string): 
    if not_palindrome(string):
        return ""

    palindrome = ""
    for char in string:
        if char == palindrome[-1]:
            palindrome += char[::-1]
        else: 
            palindrome += char

    return palindrome
``` 
This code is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of finding the shortest palindrome for a given input string. It does this by first checking if the input string is already a palindrome. If it is not, the function creates a new empty string called "palindrome" and then iterates through the input string, appending characters that match the reverse of the last character in the "palindrome" to the growing string. The function then keeps track of the last character in the "palindrome" string using the "palindrome[-1]" indexing. Finally, when the string is empty, the function returns an empty string. 

This code is a self-contained and efficient solution to the problem of finding the shortest palindrome for any given string.
