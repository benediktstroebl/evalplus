The provided code looks correct and addresses the problem of converting a given string into a palindrome. It uses a `make_palindrome` function to achieve this. The function takes a input string and checks if it's a palindrome or not using the `is_palindrome` function. 

The algorithm idea is to find the longest postfix of the string that is a palindrome and then append the reverse of the prefix to the end of the string.
