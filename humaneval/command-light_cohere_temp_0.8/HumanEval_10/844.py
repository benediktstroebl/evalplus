The provided code is a good solution to the problem and passes the test cases. It uses a simple prefix-suffix technique. 

Here's a breakdown of the code:
1. The `is_palindrome` function takes a string `string` as an argument and returns a boolean value (`True`) if the string is a palindrome and `False` otherwise. It achieves this by comparing the string with its reverse using slicing.
2. The `make_palindrome` function takes a string `string` as an argument. It returns a generate the longest palindrome by appending the reversed string prefix of the original string.
