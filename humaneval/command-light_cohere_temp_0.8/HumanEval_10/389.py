The function `make_palindrome` takes a string as input and returns the shortest palindrome of that string using a simple algorithm. 

This function first finds the longest postfix of the string that is a palindrome. Then, it appends the end of the string with the reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix. 

This approach guarantees the creation of the shortest palindrome. 

This is a self-contained solution, and it's an efficient algorithm.
