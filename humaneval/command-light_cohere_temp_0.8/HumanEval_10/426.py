The solution to the problem is a Python function that checks if a given string is a palindrome and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise. The function also creates a palindrome by reversing the first half of the string and appending it to the end.

Here is the code for the `make_palindrome` function:
```python
def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
    Algorithm idea simple: 
    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    """
    Palindrome: aa, ss, ttt, etc. Palindromes are unique, a palindrome begins with a letter or a digit, 
        and the last letter is also a letter or a digit.
   
    # Find the string prefix that matches any letter or digit in the string
    - Find the length of the palindrome
    - Repeat steps 3-4 with the reversed string prefix and the rest of the string
    - Append all the parts to the end of the string to form the palindrome
    """
    palindrome = ""
    while True:
        palindrome = palindrome + string[::-1][: palindrome.find()].ows to True palindrome, 
        break
    return palindrome
```

This function uses the concept of palindromes to reverse the first half of the string and append the reversed string to the end of the original string to form the palindrome. 

It takes advantage of the fact that any palindrome must have an odd number of reversed characters, ensuring the shortest palindrome is formed. 

The function works with a while loop that keeps appending the reversed first half of the string to the end of the original string until a palindrome is found.
