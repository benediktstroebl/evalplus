The Python script defines a function is_palindrome that checks whether a given string is a palindrome. The function returns a string's reverse as a boolean value, and it passes the test!

The function make_palindrome finds the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. The function uses a algorithm idea simple:
- Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
- Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.

The function works well for empty strings and strings that do not contain palindromes.
