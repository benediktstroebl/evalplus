The provided Python function, `is_palindrome`, passes all the tests and solves the problem of checking if a given string is a palindrome.

This function is self-contained and provides a straightforward solution to the problem. It uses basic string comparison logic to check if the string is the same when reversed.

Here's how the function works:
```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    return string == string[::-1]
```

The function takes a string `string` as input and returns a boolean value (`True` if it is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise). The function uses the slicing operator `slic` to reverse the string, and then compares it with the original string to see if they are equal.

This function is self-contained and can be easily incorporated into any Python project or script to quickly check if a given string is a palindrome.
