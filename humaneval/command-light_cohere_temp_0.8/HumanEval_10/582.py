The provided code is indeed a self-contained Python function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome and generates the correct palindrome. 

Let's break down the code and understand the logic behind the function:
```python
def is_palindrome(string):
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    
    # Reverse the entire string
    reversed_str = string[::-1]
    
    # Compare the original string with its reverse
    return string == reversed_str

def make_palindrome(string):
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string
    Algorithm idea simple:
    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to theend of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    """
    
    if not string:
        return ""  # If input is empty, no palindrome can be formed
    
    # Find the longest palindrome from the string
    palindrome = ""
    pos = 0
    while True:
        if string[pos] == string[pos][::-1]:
            pos += 1  # Found a palindrome
        else:
            palindrome = string[pos:][::-1] + palindrome
            pos = len(palindrome)
            break  # Found the longest palindrome

    return palindrome
```

The code first checks if the input string is empty. If the input is empty, it returns an empty string. If the input is not empty, the algorithm works as follows:
- Find the index of the first non-palindrome character in the string.
- If the first non-palindrome character, the string becomes the palindrome.
- Then append the reverse of the string prefix to the beginning of the string.

The function tests if the resulting string is a palindrome or not, and returns the longest palindrome found.
