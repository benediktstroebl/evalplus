This code defines a function is_palindrome that checks whether a given string is a palindrome. It does this using a method that starts by reversing the string and then comparing it with the original string. The function also defines a function make_palindrome, which creates a palindrome by finding the longest palindromic substring within the input string and then prepending it to the string.

Here is an explanation of the code:
```python
def is_palindrome(string):
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string):
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string """
    if not string:
        return ""
    l, r = 0, len(string) // 2
    while r < len(string):
        if string[l:r] == string[r:l]:
            l = r + 1
        else:
            break
    return string[:l] + string[l:r][::-1]
```

This code demonstrates a simple approach to creating palindromes in Python. It defines two functions is_palindrome and make_palindrome, each of which efficiently computes and returns a palindrome.
