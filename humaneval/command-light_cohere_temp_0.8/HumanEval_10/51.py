The answer you provided is correct. It defines a Palindrome helper functions in Python that take a string as input and return a boolean indicating whether the string is a palindrome or not. 

The function works by comparing the original string with its reverse using the slicing notation, which effectively reverses the string. 

The function then creates the shortest palindrome possible by appending the reverse of the prefix to the end of the string. 

The overall time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as it only needs to iterate once over the string.
