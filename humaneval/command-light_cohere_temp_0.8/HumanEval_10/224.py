This Python code defines a self-contained function `make_palindrome` that computes and constructs the shortest palindrome that begins with a given string. 

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:
1. The function `make_palindrome` takes a single parameter `string` which is expected to be a string.
2 The function uses a straightforward algorithm to find the shortest palindrome. It does this by finding the longest postfix of the input string that is a palindrome, then appends the reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix to the end of the string.

3 The code then returns the constructed palindrome.

Please note that the code is self-contained, and does not require any additional functions or modules.
