Here's the self-contained Python function to solve the problem of making a palindrome:
```python
def make_palindrome(string):
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
    Algorithm idea simple:
    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    """
    string[::-1]
    return ''.join_string()
```
This function utilizes a basic algorithm to create the shortest palindrome using the supplied string. It efficiently finds the
