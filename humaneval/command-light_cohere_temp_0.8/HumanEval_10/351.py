I can assist you in creating the code for the problem you described. Here's a simplest form, you can start with a basic implementation and then improve it. 

Here's a suggested starting point:
```python
def is_palindrome(string):
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string):
    if not_palindrome(string):
        return ""

    palindrome = string[:0:-1] + string[::-1] + string[-1:]
    return palindrome
```
You can then build upon this base function, considering edge cases, improving the algorithm, or adding any other necessary tests.
