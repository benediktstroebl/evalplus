Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function that solves the problem of checking if a given string is a palindrome:
```python
def is_palindrome(string): 
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string): 
    if not_palindrome(string):
        return string + string[::-1] 
    return make_palindrome(string[::-1])
```

This script has a `make_palindrome` function that finds the shortest palindrome that begins with the given string. It uses a testing on the same function and returns the solution.

Do you need help with anything else?
