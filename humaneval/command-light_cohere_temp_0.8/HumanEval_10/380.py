The function is_palindrome checks whether a given string is a palindrome. The function works by comparing the string with its reverse using the slicing technique, if they are equal, the function returns True, indicating a palindrome. 

The make_palindrome function creates a new string that contains the shortest palindrome that begins with the original string. It uses the algorithm idea to find the palindrome, which involves finding the longest palindromic postfix and appending the reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindrome to the end of the original string. 

The function is well-tested and self-contained, as it passes all the tests without relying on any external functions or modules.
