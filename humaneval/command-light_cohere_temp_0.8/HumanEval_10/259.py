The provided Python script defines a function `make_palindrome` that constructs the shortest palindrome given a string. The function uses a algorithm idea to first find the longest palindrome substring and then reverses it and appends it to the original string to produce the shortest palindrome. 

The function passes all the tests without any errors.
