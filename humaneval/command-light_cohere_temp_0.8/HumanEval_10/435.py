The Python code is:
```python
def is_palindrome(string):
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string):
    if not_palindrome(string):
        return ""

    palindromic_part = [x for x in string if x == string[1::codepair]]
    return ''.join(palindromic_part + [reversed(string[:1])])

def not_palindrome(string):
    return is_palindrome(make_palindrome(string))
```

The code has a function called `is_palindrome` that checks if a given string is a palindrome. The function works by converting the string to its reverse. The function also has another function called `make_palindrome` that finds the shortest palindrome that begins with the supplied string. The function works by first calling the `is_palindrome` function to check if the string is a palindrome and returns an empty string if it is not. Then, the function finds the longest palindromic part in the string using a list comprehension and appends it to the string in reverse order. Then, the function uses a list of characters in the string before the palindromic part and reverses it to get the palindrome.
