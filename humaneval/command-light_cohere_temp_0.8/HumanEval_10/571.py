The solution is a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome or not, using a simple algorithm.

The function uses a simple algorithm to find the shortest palindrome in a string. This algorithm works by first finding the longest postfix of the supplied string that is a palindrome. Then, it appends to the string's end the reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.

The function tests its implementation by passing different strings to the `make_palindrome` function and comparing the output with the reversed version of the input string. 

This would be the starting point for solving the problem.
