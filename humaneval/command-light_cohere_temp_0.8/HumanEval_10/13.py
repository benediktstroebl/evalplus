This Python function, `make_palindrome`, builds the longest palindrome from a given string. It uses a simple algorithm:
- Find the longest postfix of the string that is a palindrome.
- Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix. 

```python
def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ 
    Finds the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
    Algorithm idea simple:
    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    """
   
    return string + string(reversed(string[::-1]))
```
