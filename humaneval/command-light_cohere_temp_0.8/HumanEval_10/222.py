The code defines a function `make_palindrome` that constructs the shortest palindrome given a string. It uses a
algorithm to achieve this:
1. The algorithm works by first finding the longest palindrome substring in the input string, then constructing the palindrome by appending the reverse of this prefix to the end of the string.
2 The function uses the built-in function `strr()` to reverse the string.

The tests are designed to ensure the correctness of the `make_palindrome` function by passing various strings and checking the returned values.

Here's a breakdown of the code:
```python
def is_palindrome(string):
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string):
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string"""
    if not string:  # empty string
        return ""
    lps = [x for x in string if x == strr(x)[0]]
    if not lps:
        return string
    return ''.join(strr(x) for x in lps) + string[len(lps) - 1:]
```
The tests cover the edge cases, and a basic test for different inputs is also provided.
