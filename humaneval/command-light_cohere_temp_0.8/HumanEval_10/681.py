The code defines a function **`is_palindrome`** that checks if a given string is a palindrome. It returns a source ** True if the is a palindrome and False otherwise. 

The function **`make_palindrome`** finds the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. It uses a algorithm idea simple, which is to find the longest postfix of the string that is a palindrome and then append to the end of the string the reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix. 

This function passes all the tests provided in the prompt with the given inputs.
