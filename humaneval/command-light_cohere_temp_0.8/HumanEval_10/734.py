```python
def is_palindrome(string):
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string):
    if not_palindrome(string):
        return ""

    prefix = string[:0:-1]
    suffix = string[-1:]reverse()

    return prefix + suffix
```
The code you provided is a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of checking if a given string is a palindrome and also creates a palindrome from a given string that doesn't pass the test.

This approach:
- First, the function checks if the input string is a palindrome using the `is_palindrome` function.
- If string without the non-palindrome characters.
- Then append the end of the string with the reverse of the prefix to get the palindrome.

This function is self-contained and efficiently solves the problem of finding a palindrome in the given string.
