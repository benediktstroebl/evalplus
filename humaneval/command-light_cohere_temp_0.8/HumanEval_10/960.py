I can definitely assist you in creating the solution and providing the explanation. Here's a code for the example of a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of creating a palindrome from a given string:
```python
def is_palindrome(string):
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string):
    if not_palindrome(string):
        return ''.join_words([c for c in string if c != ' ' and c.is_alpha()])
    string[::-1]
    else:
        return string
```

This code defines two functions:
1. Function `is_palindrome(string)` checks if a given string is a palindrome or not.
2. Function `make_palindrome(string)` takes a string as an argument and checks for the existence of a palindrome. If the string is not a palindrome, it constructs a palindrome by joining non-space characters that are also vowels. 

This algorithm uses the concept of converting spaces into vowels to make the string into a palindrome.
