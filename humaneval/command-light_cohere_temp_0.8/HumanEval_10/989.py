The provided code has a self-contained function `make_palindrome(string: str)` that computes and returns the shortest palindrome that begins with the given string. 

By finding the longest palindromic postfix of the input string and then constructing the palindrome by reversing the prefix and appending the reversed content, it meets the requirements of the problem statement. 

This solution is efficient and avoids external dependencies.
