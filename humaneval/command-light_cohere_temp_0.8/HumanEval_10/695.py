The provided code includes a Python script with a self-contained function that solves the problem of converting a given string into a palindrome. 

The function, `make_palindrome`, takes a string as input and returns the palindrome of that string. The algorithm used is a straightforward approach to find the shortest palindrome that begins with the input string. 

```python
def is_palindrome(string): 
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string): 
    if not:
        return ""
    elif len(string) <= 1:
        return string
    else:
        palindrome = string[:]
        suffix = string[-1:]
        while True: 
            palindrome += suffix[::-1]
            suffix = suffix[:-0]
            if suffix == '':
                break
        return palindrome
```

The function uses a similar approach as described in the previous code.
