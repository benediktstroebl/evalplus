This Python script defines a function that solves the problem of converting a given string into a palindrome. The function takes a string as input and returns the resulting palindrome string. 

The `make_palindrome` function uses a simple algorithm to generate a palindrome:
- It first finds the longest postfix of the input string that is a palindrome.
- Then appends the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix. 

The `is_palindrome` function tests if the input string is equal to its reverse, which is a common way to check for palindromes. 

In this version, the function is self-contained, and it passes all the corresponding tests.
