The provided code defines a function `make_palindrome` that constructs the shortest palindrome using a simple algorithm.

Let's break down the function:
1. `def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str`:
   - Accepts a string as input.
   - The algorithm:
     - It iterates through each character in the input string.
     - If character is appended to the string if it's a palindrome.
     - After then reverse the process, the algorithm reverses the string prefix and appends it to the end of the string.
   - Returns the string by appending palindrome characters and finally returns the result.

Let's take a look at the test cases:
- When you call `make_palindrome()` with an empty string:
```python
make_palindrome('')
# Output: ''
```
- When you call with a string that does not contain any palindromes:
```python
make_palindrome('cat')
# Output: 'catac'
```
- When you call with a string that contains a palindrome:
```python
make_palindrome('cata')
# Output: 'catac'
```
This function provides a straightforward solution to construct the shortest palindrome using a character-building approach.
