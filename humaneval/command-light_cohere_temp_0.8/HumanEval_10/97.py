The Python script provided defines a function, `make_palindrome(string)`, that creates a palindrome from a given string. This function uses a how simple algorithm to find the shortest palindrome by finding the longest palindromic substring and appending the reverse of the prefix. 

This function is self-contained and does not rely on any other functions or modules.
