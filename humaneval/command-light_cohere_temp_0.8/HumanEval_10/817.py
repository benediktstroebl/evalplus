Here is a self-contained Python function that solves the problem you have provided:
```python
def is_palindrome(string):
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string):
    if not_palindrome(string):
        return ""

    # Palindrome detection logic
    palindrome = []
    for char in string:
        if char == palindrome[-1] or char == palindrome[-2]:
            palindrome.append(char)
        else:
            # If not palindrome, reverse and append
            palindrome.append(char[::-1])
            break
    return ''.join(palindrome)
```

This function is self-contained and provides a solution for the problem you provided. The function checks if the string is a palindrome, and if not, it constructs the shortest palindrome for it by iterating through the string and appending characters that match the prefix and the suffix of the palindrome. 

The function then returns the resulting palindrome string.
