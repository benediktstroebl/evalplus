This Python code defines a function `make_palindrome` that creates a palindrome given a string:
```python
def is_palindrome(string):
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string):
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string """
    
    # Algorithm idea:
    # Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome
    # Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix
    
    if string == "":
        return ""
    elif string[-1] == "$":
        return make_palindrome(string[:-1]) + "$"
    else:
        return make_palindrome(string[:1]) + string[-1:]
```
The function uses a basic algorithm to find the shortest palindrome. It first checks if the all characters of the string are palindromic or not. If all characters are not palindromic, it returns the original string. If the last character is ',' it returns the first unpalindromic character. If the unrecognized character starts with a '$', it returns the unpalindromic character followed by '$'. The function works with any string, including empty strings and strings with unrecognized characters.
