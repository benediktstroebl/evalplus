The provided code is a self-contained Python function that checks if a given string is a palindrome. It uses a basic algorithm to achieve this:

1. string `is_palindrome()` function:
```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    return string == string[::-1]
```

2. `make_palindrome()` function:
```python
def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
    Algorithm idea simple:
    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    """
    string = ''.join the palindrome_helper(string)
    return string

```

In this code, the `make_palindrome` function iteratively applies the algorithm from the helper function `palindrome_helper` to the input string.

The `palindrome_helper` function uses the algorithm:
```python
def palindrome_helper(string: str) -> str:
    """ Helper function for make_palindrome() """
    # Find the longest postfix of the string that is a palindrome
    # Return the string reversed if it's a palindrome, otherwise return the prefix
    if len(string) < 2:
        return string
    # Find the longest palindrome
    l, r = 0, 1
    palindrome = ''
    while r < len(string) - 1:
        if string[r] == string[r + 1]:
            r += 2
        else:
            palindrome = string[l:r]
            l = r + 1
    return palindrome[::-1]
```

This function checks if the input string is less than 2 characters long and returns it as it's not a palindrome. If the string is at least 2 characters long, it iterates through the characters and appends the longest palindrome (including its reverse) to the current prefix of the string.

After both functions are defined, they can be used as a full self-contained solution to the problem of checking if a given string is a palindrome and to find the shortest palindrome that begins with the string.
