```
The function can_arrange takes an array arr as input and returns the largest index of an element which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If there are no duplicate values in the array, the function returns None. The function uses a set data structure to keep track of the elements that have been encountered so far. The function iterates through the array elements and checks if the current element is already in the seen set. If it is, the function returns -1 to indicate that there is no unique element. If the loop completes without finding a duplicate value, the function returns the index of the first unique element. If no unique elements is found, the function returns -1 to indicate that there are no unique elements in the array.
