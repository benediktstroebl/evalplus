    # Hint 1:
    # There is a mathematical trick to quickly find the largest divisor for a given number
    # I've left it in the code as a comment
    # Hint 2:
    # This is a simple brute force approach. Loop over all numbers smaller than n, and for
    # each of them check if that number divides n evenly
    # Hint 3:
    # This problem is basically the same as the smallest_divisor problem, just that we want
    # the largest divisor. So we can use the same helper function that we've written
    # There is, however, a small modification that needs to be made. Can you find it?

    return 1  # Remove this line once you're done with the exercise
