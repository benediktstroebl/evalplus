    Example
        For N = 1000, the sum of digits will be 1 the output should be "1".
        For N = 150, the sum of digits will be 6 the output should be "110".
        For N = 147, the sum of digits will be 12 the output should be "1100".

    # since we're going to take the quotient of N and use it for N the answer is how many digits it has.
