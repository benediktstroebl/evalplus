    # Question to ask:
    # is it okay to change the order of the list (assuming that we are allowed
    # to change the list)
    # or do we need to keep the list in the same order

    # this function has 3 loops.
    # 1. we start with a triple for loop
    # 2. we will use a hash table
    # 3. we can also solve this problem using binary search

    # Is this problem a duplicate?
    # have you seen a problem similar to this one before?

    # let's try solving this problem by using a for loop.
    # What is the brute force solution?
    # let's write some code

    # can you come up with a brute force solution on your own?
    # how can we optimize our code?
    # hash table?
    # sort the list?
    # any other ideas?

    # How should we test our code?
    # can you think of any edge cases?
    # can you think of a small input and try to solve the problem manually?

    # the brute force solution is too slow.

    # let's implement a hash table and try to solve the problem again.

    # let's think of a hash table approach.
    # can we think of a good hash function?

    # for simplicity, we can use the integer itself as the hash function.
