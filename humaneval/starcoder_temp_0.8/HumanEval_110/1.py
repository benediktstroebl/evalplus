    # SOLUTION
    #
    # The problem can be resolved by sorting both lists and comparing the elements
    # of both lists. If the elements are equal, they are sorted. If the elements
    # are not equal, the smaller element is at the start of the second list.
    # The problem can be resolved by finding the index of the smaller element in the
    # second list and swapping the elements at the same position in both lists.
    #
    # Runtime complexity: O(nlog(n))
    #
    # Note: This is a highly inefficient solution that solves the problem in O(n^2)
    # time complexity. The goal was to use Python only.
