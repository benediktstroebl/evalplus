    # Note: since this is a simple quadratic algorithm, this can be solved
    # in linear time by using a hash map.

    # algorithm to solve this problem
    # 1. first we need to sort the list
    # 2. we then look for sum of 0 by taking one element
    # 3. iterate through the list and try to find another pair of elements
    #    that sum to zero by taking the second element of the list and iterating
    #    through the rest of the list

    # 1. sort the list
    l.sort()

    # 2. iterate through the list and find the sum of zero
    for i in range(len(l)):
        # 3. iterate through the rest of the list
        for j in range(i+1, len(l)):
            # 4. if they sum to zero, return True
            if l[i] + l[j] == 0:
                return True

    # 5. return False if no match is found
    return False
