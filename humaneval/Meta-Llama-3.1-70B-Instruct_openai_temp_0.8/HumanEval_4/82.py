This script defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a given list of numbers. The function first checks if the input list is empty, then calculates the mean of the input numbers. It then calculates the absolute difference between each element and the mean, and finally calculates the mean of these absolute differences, which is the MAD.

The script also includes a test case at the end to demonstrate how to use the function.
