```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    
    Parameters:
    numbers (List[float]): A list of input numbers.
    
    Returns:
    float: The Mean Absolute Deviation of the input numbers.
    """
    
    # Calculate the mean of the input numbers
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the absolute difference between each element and the mean
    absolute_diffs = [abs(x - mean) for x in numbers]
    
    # Calculate the mean of the absolute differences
    mad = sum(absolute_diffs) / len(absolute_diffs)
    
    return mad

# Test the function
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))  # Output: 1.0
```

Alternatively, you can use the `statistics` module in Python to simplify the code:

```python
from typing import List
import statistics

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    
    Parameters:
    numbers (List[float]): A list of input numbers.
    
    Returns:
    float: The Mean Absolute Deviation of the input numbers.
    """
    
    # Calculate the mean of the input numbers
    mean = statistics.mean(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the absolute difference between each element and the mean
    absolute_diffs = [abs(x - mean) for x in numbers]
    
    # Calculate the mean of the absolute differences
    mad = statistics.mean(absolute_diffs)
    
    return mad

# Test the function
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))  # Output: 1.0
```

You can also use `numpy` library to further simplify the code:

```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    
    Parameters:
    numbers (List[float]): A list of input numbers.
    
    Returns:
    float: The Mean Absolute Deviation of the input numbers.
    """
    
    # Convert the list to a numpy array
    numbers = np.array(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the mean of the input numbers
    mean = np.mean(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the absolute difference between each element and the mean
    absolute_diffs = np.abs(numbers - mean)
    
    # Calculate the mean of the absolute differences
    mad = np.mean(absolute_diffs)
    
    return mad

# Test the function
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))  # Output: 1.0
