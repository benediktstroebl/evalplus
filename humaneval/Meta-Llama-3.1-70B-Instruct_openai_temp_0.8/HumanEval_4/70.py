```

This script defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation of a given list of numbers. It first calculates the mean of the numbers, then calculates the absolute difference between each element and the mean, and finally calculates the mean of these absolute differences. The result is the Mean Absolute Deviation.

The script also includes an example usage of the function with the list `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]`, which outputs `1.0` as expected.
