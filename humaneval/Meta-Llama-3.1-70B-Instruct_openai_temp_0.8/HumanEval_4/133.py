```

This script defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation for a given list of numbers. It first checks if the input list is empty and raises a `ValueError` if it is. Then, it calculates the mean of the input list, calculates the absolute deviation from the mean for each number, and finally calculates the mean of the absolute deviations. The result is returned as a float.

The script also includes example usage of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function.
