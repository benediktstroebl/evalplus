```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.

    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The Mean Absolute Deviation of the input numbers.
    """

    # First, calculate the mean of the input numbers
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

    # Then, calculate the absolute difference between each number and the mean
    absolute_deviations = [abs(num - mean) for num in numbers]

    # Finally, calculate the mean of these absolute deviations
    mad = sum(absolute_deviations) / len(absolute_deviations)

    return mad


# Example usage:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))  # Output: 1.0
```

To make the code more robust, you could also add some error checking to handle edge cases such as an empty list or a list with a single element. Here's an updated version:

```python
from typing import List

    Returns:
        float: The Mean Absolute Deviation of the input numbers.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input list is empty.
        ValueError: If the input list contains a single element.
    """

    if len(numbers) == 0:
        raise ValueError("Input list cannot be empty")
    elif len(numbers) == 1:
        raise ValueError("Input list must contain more than one element")

    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    absolute_deviations = [abs(num - mean) for num in numbers]
    mad = sum(absolute_deviations) / len(absolute_deviations)

    return mad


# Example usage:

print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))  # Output: 1.0

# Test error handling
try:
    print(mean_absolute_deviation([]))
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)

try:
    print(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0]))
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
