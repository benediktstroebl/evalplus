```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of a given dataset.

    Args:
        numbers: A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        The Mean Absolute Deviation of the given dataset.
    """
    # First, calculate the mean of the given dataset
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    
    # Then, calculate the absolute difference between each element and the mean
    absolute_deviations = [abs(num - mean) for num in numbers]
    
    # Finally, calculate the average of these absolute differences
    mad = sum(absolute_deviations) / len(absolute_deviations)
    
    return mad

# Example usage:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))  # Output: 1.0
```

Alternatively, you could use the `statistics` module and a list comprehension to simplify the function:

```python
from typing import List
import statistics

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of a given dataset.

    Args:
        numbers: A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        The Mean Absolute Deviation of the given dataset.
    """
    mean = statistics.mean(numbers)
    return sum(abs(num - mean) for num in numbers) / len(numbers)

# Example usage:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))  # Output: 1.0
```
