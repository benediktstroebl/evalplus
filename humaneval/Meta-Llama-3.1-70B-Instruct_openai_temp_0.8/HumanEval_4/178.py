```python
from typing import List
import statistics

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    """
    # Calculate the mean of the given list of numbers
    mean = statistics.mean(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the absolute difference between each number and the mean
    absolute_differences = [abs(num - mean) for num in numbers]
    
    # Calculate the mean of the absolute differences
    mad = statistics.mean(absolute_differences)
    
    return mad

# Example usage:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))  # Output: 1.0
```

Alternatively, you could also use NumPy to achieve the same result in a more concise manner:

```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    """
    numbers = np.array(numbers)
    return np.mean(np.abs(numbers - np.mean(numbers)))

# Example usage:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))  # Output: 1.0
```

Both of these scripts will calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation for a given list of numbers and return the result.
