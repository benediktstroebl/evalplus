    Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of

    Args:
        string (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        int: The number of distinct characters in the string.

    Examples:
        >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
        3
        >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
        4

    # Convert the string to a set, which automatically removes duplicates
    # We also convert the string to lower case to ignore case sensitivity
    distinct_chars = set(string.lower())
    
    # Return the number of distinct characters
    return len(distinct_chars)


# Test the function
print(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'))  # Expected output: 3
print(count_distinct_characters('Jerry'))   # Expected output: 4
