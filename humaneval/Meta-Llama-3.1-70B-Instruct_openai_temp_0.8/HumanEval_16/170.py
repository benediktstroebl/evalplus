    Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of.

    Returns:
        int: The number of distinct characters in the string.

This script defines a function `count_distinct_characters` that takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string, regardless of case. The function uses a set to remove duplicates and then returns the size of the set. The script also includes two test cases to verify that the function works correctly.
