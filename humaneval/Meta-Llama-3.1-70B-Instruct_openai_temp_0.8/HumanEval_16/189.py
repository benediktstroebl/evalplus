    Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of.

    Args:
        string (str): Input string.

    Returns:
        int: Number of distinct characters in the string.

    Examples:
        >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
        3
        >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
        5

    # Return the number of distinct characters
    return len(distinct_characters)


# Test cases
print(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'))  # Expected output: 3
print(count_distinct_characters('Jerry'))  # Expected output: 5
