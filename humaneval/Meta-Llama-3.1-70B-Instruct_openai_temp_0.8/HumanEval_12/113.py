```python
from typing import List, Optional


def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Out of list of strings, return the longest one. Return the first one in case of multiple
    strings of the same length. Return None in case the input list is empty.

    Args:
        strings (List[str]): A list of strings.

    Returns:
        Optional[str]: The longest string in the list, or None if the list is empty.
    """
    if not strings:
        return None
    return max(strings, key=len)


# Test cases
print(longest([]))  # None
print(longest(['a', 'b', 'c']))  # 'a'
print(longest(['a', 'bb', 'ccc']))  # 'ccc'
```

This script defines a function `longest` that takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest string. If the input list is empty, it returns `None`. The `max` function is used with the `key` argument set to `len` to find the longest string. If there are multiple strings of the same length, the first one is returned. The test cases are included at the end of the script to verify the correctness of the function.
