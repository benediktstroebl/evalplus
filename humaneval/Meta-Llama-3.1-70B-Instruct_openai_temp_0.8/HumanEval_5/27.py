```python

    Insert a number 'delimiter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'.

    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.
        delimiter (int): The number to be inserted between every two consecutive elements.

    Returns:
        List[int]: A new list with 'delimiter' inserted between every two consecutive elements.

print(intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4))  # [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
```
This script defines a function `intersperse` that takes a list of numbers and a delimiter as input. It iterates over the input list, appending each number to the result list, and also appends the delimiter after each number except the last one. The function returns the resulting list. The example use cases demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs.
