This script defines a function `intersperse` that takes a list of integers and a delimiter as input, and returns a new list where the delimiter is inserted between every two consecutive elements of the input list. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the input list, and appends each element and the delimiter (if it's not the last element) to the result list. The test cases at the end verify the correctness of the function.
