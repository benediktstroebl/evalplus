        numbers (List[int]): The input list of integers.
        delimiter (int): The number to be inserted between consecutive elements.

    Returns:
        List[int]: The modified list with 'delimiter' inserted between consecutive elements.

This script defines the function `intersperse` as specified, along with test cases to verify its correctness. It iterates through the input list `numbers`, appending each number to the result list and inserting the `delimiter` between consecutive numbers.
