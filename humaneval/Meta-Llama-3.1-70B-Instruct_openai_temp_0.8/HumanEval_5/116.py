This script defines a function `intersperse` that takes a list of integers and a delimiter as input, and returns a new list with the delimiter inserted between every two consecutive elements. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the input list, appending each element to the result list, and appending the delimiter if it's not the last element. The test cases at the end of the script demonstrate the function's behavior.
