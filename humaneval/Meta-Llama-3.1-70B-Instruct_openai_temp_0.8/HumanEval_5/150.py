```python
from typing import List
import itertools

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'
    
    Args:
    numbers (List[int]): The input list of integers.
    delimeter (int): The number to be inserted between consecutive elements.
    
    Returns:
    List[int]: The resulting list with delimeter inserted between consecutive elements.
    """
    return list(itertools.chain.from_iterable(itertools.zip_longest(numbers, [delimeter] * len(numbers), fillvalue=numbers[-1])))


# Test cases
print(intersperse([], 4))  # Output: []
print(intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4))  # Output: [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
```

This script uses the `itertools` module, which provides a function to make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables. The `zip_longest` function is used to pair each number with the delimiter, and `chain.from_iterable` is used to flatten the list of pairs into a single list.

However, this solution has a flaw: the last element of `numbers` is repeated at the end of the resulting list. If you don't want this, you should handle the case where `numbers` is not empty separately:

```python
from typing import List
import itertools

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'
    
    Args:
    numbers (List[int]): The input list of integers.
    delimeter (int): The number to be inserted between consecutive elements.
    
    Returns:
    List[int]: The resulting list with delimeter inserted between consecutive elements.
    """
    if not numbers:
        return []
    return list(itertools.chain.from_iterable(itertools.zip_longest(numbers[:-1], [delimeter] * (len(numbers) - 1)))).append(numbers[-1])


# Test cases
print(intersperse([], 4))  # Output: []
print(intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4))  # Output: [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
```

Or you could use a simple loop to achieve the same result:

```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'
    
    Args:
    numbers (List[int]): The input list of integers.
    delimeter (int): The number to be inserted between consecutive elements.
    
    Returns:
    List[int]: The resulting list with delimeter inserted between consecutive elements.
    """
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        result.append(num)
        if num!= numbers[-1]:
            result.append(delimeter)
    return result


# Test cases
print(intersperse([], 4))  # Output: []
print(intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4))  # Output: [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
```
