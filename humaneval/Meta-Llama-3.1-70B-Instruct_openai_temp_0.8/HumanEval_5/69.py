Here's a self-contained Python script to solve the problem:

```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimiter: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Insert a number 'delimiter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'

    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): The input list of integers.
        delimiter (int): The number to be inserted between every two consecutive elements.

    Returns:
        List[int]: The modified list with the delimiter inserted.
    """

    result = []
    for i, num in enumerate(numbers):
        result.append(num)
        if i < len(numbers) - 1:
            result.append(delimiter)
    return result

# Test cases
print(intersperse([], 4))  # []
print(intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4))  # [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
```

This script defines the `intersperse` function as per the given problem statement. It iterates over the input list `numbers` and appends each number to the result list. If it's not the last number in the list, it also appends the delimiter. The function returns the modified list.

The script includes test cases to verify the correctness of the `intersperse` function.
