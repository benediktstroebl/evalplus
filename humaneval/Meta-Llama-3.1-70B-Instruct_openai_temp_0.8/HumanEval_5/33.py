```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimiter: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Inserts a number 'delimiter' between every two consecutive elements of input list 'numbers'.

    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): The input list of integers.
        delimiter (int): The number to be inserted between every two consecutive elements.

    Returns:
        List[int]: The modified list with 'delimiter' inserted between every two consecutive elements.

    Examples:
        >>> intersperse([], 4)
        []
        >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)
        [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
    """
    result = []
    for i, num in enumerate(numbers):
        result.append(num)
        if i < len(numbers) - 1:
            result.append(delimiter)
    return result

# Test cases
print(intersperse([], 4))  # Output: []
print(intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4))  # Output: [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
```

This Python script defines a function `intersperse` that takes a list of integers `numbers` and an integer `delimiter` as input. It then inserts the `delimiter` between every two consecutive elements of the `numbers` list. The function uses a for loop with the `enumerate` function to iterate over the `numbers` list and append each number and the `delimiter` (if it's not the last number) to the `result` list. The script also includes two test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
