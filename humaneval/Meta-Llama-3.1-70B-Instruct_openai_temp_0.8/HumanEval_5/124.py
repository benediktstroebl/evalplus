```python

    Insert a number 'delimiter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'

    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.
        delimiter (int): The number to be inserted between every two consecutive elements.

    Returns:
        List[int]: The modified list with the delimiter inserted.

This script defines the `intersperse` function that takes a list of integers and a delimiter as input, and returns a new list where the delimiter is inserted between every two consecutive elements of the input list. The function uses a simple iteration over the input list and appends the delimiter and the current number to the result list accordingly. The script also includes two test cases to demonstrate the usage of the function.
