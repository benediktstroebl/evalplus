```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimiter: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Insert a number 'delimiter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'

    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): The input list of numbers.
        delimiter (int): The number to be inserted between every two consecutive elements.

    Returns:
        List[int]: The modified list with the delimiter inserted between every two consecutive elements.
    """
    result = []
    for i, num in enumerate(numbers):
        result.append(num)
        if i < len(numbers) - 1:
            result.append(delimiter)
    return result

# Test cases
print(intersperse([], 4))  # Output: []
print(intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4))  # Output: [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
```

In this script, the `intersperse` function iterates through the input list `numbers`. For each number, it appends the number to the result list and checks if it's not the last number in the list. If it's not the last number, it appends the `delimiter` to the result list. This way, the `delimiter` is inserted between every two consecutive elements in the input list.
