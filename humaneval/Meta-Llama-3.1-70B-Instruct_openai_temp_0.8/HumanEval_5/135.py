```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'

    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): The input list of numbers.
        delimeter (int): The number to be inserted between consecutive elements.

    Returns:
        List[int]: The modified list with delimeter inserted between consecutive elements.

    Examples:
        >>> intersperse([], 4)
        []
        >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)
        [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
    """
    result = []
    for i, num in enumerate(numbers):
        result.append(num)
        if i < len(numbers) - 1:
            result.append(delimeter)
    return result


# Test cases
print(intersperse([], 4))  # []
print(intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4))  # [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
```

This script defines the `intersperse` function as specified, which iterates over the input list `numbers` and appends each number to the result list, followed by the `delimeter` if it's not the last number in the list. The test cases at the end verify the function's correctness.
