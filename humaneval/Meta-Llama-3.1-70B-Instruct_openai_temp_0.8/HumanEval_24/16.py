```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """
    For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n

    Args:
        n (int): The input number.

    Returns:
        int: The largest divisor of n.

    Example:
        >>> largest_divisor(15)
        5
    """
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):

print(largest_divisor(15))  # Output: 5
```

This script defines a function `largest_divisor` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest number that divides `n` evenly, which is smaller than `n`. The function iterates over the numbers from `n - 1` down to `1`, and returns the first number that divides `n` evenly (i.e., leaves a remainder of `0`). The script also includes a test case to demonstrate the function's usage.
