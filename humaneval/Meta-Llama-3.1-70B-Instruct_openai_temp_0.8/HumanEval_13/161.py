```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b

    This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor.
    The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for calculating the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

    Args:
        a (int): The first integer.
        b (int): The second integer.

    Returns:
        int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.

    Examples:
        >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
        1
        >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
        5
    """
    while b!= 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return abs(a)

# Test the function
print(greatest_common_divisor(3, 5))  # Output: 1
print(greatest_common_divisor(25, 15))  # Output: 5

This script defines a function `greatest_common_divisor` that takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their greatest common divisor. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for calculating the greatest common divisor of two numbers. The script also includes test cases to demonstrate the function's usage.
