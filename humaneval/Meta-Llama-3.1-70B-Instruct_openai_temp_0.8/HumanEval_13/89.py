```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b.

    This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.
    The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient way to compute the GCD
    of two numbers by iteratively applying the remainder operation.

    Args:
        a (int): The first integer.
        b (int): The second integer.

    Returns:
        int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.

    Examples:
        >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
        1
        >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
        5
    """
    while b!= 0:
        # In each iteration, replace 'a' with 'b' and 'b' with the remainder of 'a' divided by 'b'.
        a, b = b, a % b
    # At the end of the algorithm, 'a' will be the GCD of the original 'a' and 'b'.
    return abs(a)

# Test cases
print(greatest_common_divisor(3, 5))  # Expected output: 1
print(greatest_common_divisor(25, 15))  # Expected output: 5
