```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b

    This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers.

    Args:
        a (int): The first integer.
        b (int): The second integer.

    Returns:
        int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.

    Examples:
        >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
        1
        >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
        5
    """
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Test the function
print(greatest_common_divisor(3, 5))  # Output: 1
print(greatest_common_divisor(25, 15))  # Output: 5
```
This Python function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`. The algorithm works by repeatedly replacing `a` and `b` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, until `b` is 0. The GCD is then `a`.
