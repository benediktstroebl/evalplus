    Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b.
    
    This function uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method 
    for computing the greatest common divisor of two integers.

    Args:
        a (int): The first integer.
        b (int): The second integer.

    Returns:
        int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.

    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
