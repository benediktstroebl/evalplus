```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b.

    This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

    Args:
        a (int): The first integer.
        b (int): The second integer.

    Returns:
        int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.

    Examples:
        >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
        1
        >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
        5
    """
    while b!= 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a


# Test the function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(greatest_common_divisor(3, 5))   # Expected output: 1
    print(greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)) # Expected output: 5
```

This script defines a function `greatest_common_divisor` that takes two integers as input and returns their greatest common divisor. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. The algorithm works by repeatedly applying the division algorithm, swapping the remainder with the divisor, until the remainder is 0. At that point, the divisor is the GCD.

The script also includes a test block that checks the function with the examples provided in the problem statement.
