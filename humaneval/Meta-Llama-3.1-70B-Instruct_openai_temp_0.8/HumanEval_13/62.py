```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b.

    This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

    Args:
        a (int): The first integer.
        b (int): The second integer.

    Returns:
        int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.

    Examples:
        >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
        1
        >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
        5
    """
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Test cases
print(greatest_common_divisor(3, 5))  # Expected output: 1
print(greatest_common_divisor(25, 15))  # Expected output: 5
```

This script defines a function `greatest_common_divisor` that takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their greatest common divisor. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is a efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. The algorithm works by repeatedly applying the division algorithm, swapping the remainder with the divisor, until the remainder is 0. At that point, the non-zero remainder is the GCD.

The script also includes two test cases to demonstrate the function's usage and expected output.
