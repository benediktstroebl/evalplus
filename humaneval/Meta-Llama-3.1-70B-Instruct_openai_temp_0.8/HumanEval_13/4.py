```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b

    This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers.

    Args:
        a (int): The first integer.
        b (int): The second integer.

    Returns:
        int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.

    Examples:
        >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
        1
        >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
        5
    """
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Test cases
print(greatest_common_divisor(3, 5))  # Expected output: 1
print(greatest_common_divisor(25, 15))  # Expected output: 5
```

This script defines a function `greatest_common_divisor` that takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their greatest common divisor. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is a efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. The algorithm works by repeatedly replacing `a` and `b` with `b` and `a % b`, respectively, until `b` becomes zero. At that point, `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`. The script also includes test cases to verify that the function works correctly.
