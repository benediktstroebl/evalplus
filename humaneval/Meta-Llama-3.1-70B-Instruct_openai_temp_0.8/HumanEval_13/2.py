```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b

    This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor.

    Args:
        a (int): The first integer.
        b (int): The second integer.

    Returns:
        int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.

    Examples:
        >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
        1
        >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
        5
    """
    while b!= 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Test cases
print(greatest_common_divisor(3, 5))  # Expected output: 1
print(greatest_common_divisor(25, 15))  # Expected output: 5
```

This script defines a function `greatest_common_divisor` that takes two integers as input and returns their greatest common divisor. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces `a` and `b` with `b` and `a % b` until `b` is zero, at which point `a` is the greatest common divisor.

The script also includes test cases to demonstrate the function's correctness.
