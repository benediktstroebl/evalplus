This script defines a function `find_closest_elements` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the two closest numbers in ascending order. The function first sorts the list of numbers, then iterates over the sorted list to find the pair of numbers with the smallest difference. The function returns the pair of closest numbers. The script also includes test cases to demonstrate the function's correctness.
