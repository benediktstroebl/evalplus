This code defines two functions: `is_palindrome` checks whether a string is a palindrome, and `make_palindrome` generates the shortest palindrome that begins with a given string. It does this by iterating through the string from the end to the start and appending the reverse of the prefix to the longest palindromic postfix found. If no palindromic postfix is found, it appends the reverse of the entire string. The code includes test cases to demonstrate its functionality.
