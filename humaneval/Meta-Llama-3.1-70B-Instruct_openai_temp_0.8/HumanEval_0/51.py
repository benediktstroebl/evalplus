This script first sorts the list of numbers in ascending order. Then, it iterates over the sorted list, calculating the difference between each number and the next one. If it finds a difference less than or equal to the threshold, it immediately returns `True`. If it iterates over the entire list without finding any such pairs, it returns `False`.
