    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than

This script first sorts the list of numbers in ascending order, then iterates over the sorted list to find the minimum difference between any two numbers. If the minimum difference is less than or equal to the threshold, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
