```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): The list of numbers to check.
        threshold (float): The minimum distance between two numbers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if any two numbers are closer than the threshold, False otherwise.
    """
    # First, we sort the list of numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort()

    # Then, we iterate over the sorted list of numbers
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        # For each number, we check if the difference between it and the next number
        # is less than or equal to the threshold
        if numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i] <= threshold:
            # If we find a pair of numbers that are closer than the threshold, we
            # immediately return True
            return True

    # If we've checked all pairs of numbers and haven't found any that are closer
    # than the threshold, we return False
    return False


# Example usage:
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
```

However, this solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation.

Here's an alternative solution that uses a different approach with a time complexity of O(n):

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): The list of numbers to check.
        threshold (float): The minimum distance between two numbers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if any two numbers are closer than the threshold, False otherwise.
    """
    # We iterate over the list of numbers
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        # For each number, we check the remaining numbers in the list
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            # We check if the difference between the two numbers is less than or
            # equal to the threshold
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) <= threshold:
                # If we find a pair of numbers that are closer than the threshold,
                # we immediately return True
                return True

    # If we've checked all pairs of numbers and haven't found any that are closer
    # than the threshold, we return False
    return False


# Example usage:
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
```

However, this solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) which is not efficient for large lists.

To improve the efficiency, we can use a data structure like a binary search tree or a k-d tree to store the numbers and then query the tree to find the closest pair of numbers. But this approach is more complex and might be overkill for this problem.

Another approach is to use a single pass through the list and keep
