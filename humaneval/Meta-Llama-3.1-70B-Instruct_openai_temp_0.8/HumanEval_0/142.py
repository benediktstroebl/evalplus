        threshold (float): The minimum distance between two numbers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if there are two numbers closer than the threshold, False otherwise.

This script defines a function `has_close_elements` that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input. It sorts the list of numbers and then iterates over the sorted list, calculating the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers. If it finds a pair of numbers with a difference less than or equal to the threshold, it returns `True`. If it iterates over the entire list without finding any such pairs, it returns `False`. The script also includes two test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
