    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.
        threshold (float): The minimum distance between two numbers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if two numbers are closer than the threshold, False otherwise.

    # First, sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort()

    # Then, iterate over the sorted list to find close elements
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        # If the difference between two adjacent numbers is less than the threshold, return True
        if numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i] < threshold:
            return True

    # If no close elements are found, return False
    return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False

This script defines the `has_close_elements` function, which takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input. It sorts the list of numbers and then checks if any two adjacent numbers are closer than the threshold. If such numbers are found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The script also includes test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
