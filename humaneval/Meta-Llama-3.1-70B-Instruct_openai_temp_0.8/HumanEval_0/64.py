```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.
        threshold (float): The minimum distance between two numbers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if there are two numbers closer than the threshold, False otherwise.
    """
    # First, we sort the list of numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort()

    # Then, we iterate over the sorted list of numbers
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        # For each number, we calculate the difference with the next number
        diff = numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i]
        # If the difference is less than or equal to the threshold, we return True
        if diff <= threshold:
            return True

    # If we have iterated over the entire list without finding two numbers closer than
    # the threshold, we return False
    return False

# Example usage:
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
```

Alternatively, you can use a more concise version of the function:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.
        threshold (float): The minimum distance between two numbers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if there are two numbers closer than the threshold, False otherwise.
    """
    return any(numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i] <= threshold 
               for i in range(len(sorted(numbers)) - 1))

# Example usage:
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
```
