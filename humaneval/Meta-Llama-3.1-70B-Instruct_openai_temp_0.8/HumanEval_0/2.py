    threshold (float): The minimum distance required between two numbers.

    Returns:
    bool: True if any two numbers are closer than the threshold, False otherwise.

This script defines a function `has_close_elements` that checks if any two numbers in the given list are closer to each other than the specified threshold. It sorts the list in ascending order and then iterates through the sorted list to compare adjacent numbers. If it finds a pair of numbers that are closer than the threshold, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The script includes two test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
