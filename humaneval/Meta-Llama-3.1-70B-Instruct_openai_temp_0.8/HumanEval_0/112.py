def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:

    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.
        threshold (float): The minimum distance between two numbers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if there are two numbers closer than the threshold, False otherwise.

    # First, sort the list of numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort()

    # Iterate over the sorted list of numbers
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        # Calculate the difference between the current number and the next number
        difference = numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i]
        
        # If the difference is less than or equal to the threshold, return True
        if difference <= threshold:
            return True

    # If no two numbers are closer than the threshold, return False
    return False


# Example use cases:
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
```

This script defines a function `has_close_elements` that checks if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold. It sorts the list of numbers and then iterates over the sorted list, checking the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers. If it finds a pair of numbers that are closer than the threshold, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The script includes example use cases to demonstrate how to use the function.
