from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if in the given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than the given threshold.

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.
        threshold (float): The minimum distance required between two numbers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if at least two numbers are closer than the threshold, False otherwise.

    # Iterate over the sorted list to find any adjacent elements with a difference less than the threshold
    for i in range(len(sorted_numbers) - 1):
        # Calculate the difference between the current element and the next one
        difference = sorted_numbers[i + 1] - sorted_numbers[i]

        if difference < threshold:
            return True

# Example usage:
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True

This script defines the `has_close_elements` function as requested, along with a docstring that explains its purpose, parameters, and return value. The function works by sorting the input list and then iterating over the sorted list to find any adjacent elements with a difference less than the threshold. If such elements are found, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The script also includes example usage of the function.
