This script defines the `sum_product` function that calculates the sum and product of a list of integers. It handles the edge case where the input list is empty by initializing the sum to 0 and the product to 1. The function then iterates over each number in the list, updating the sum and product accordingly. Finally, it returns the sum and product as a tuple. The script includes two test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
