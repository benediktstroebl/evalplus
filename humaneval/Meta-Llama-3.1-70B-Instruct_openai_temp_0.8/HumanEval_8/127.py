Here's a Python script that defines the `sum_product` function as per the given specification:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.

    Args:
    numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.

    Returns:
    Tuple[int, int]: A tuple containing the sum and product of the integers in the list.
    """
    total_sum = sum(numbers)
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    return total_sum, product

# Example usage:
print(sum_product([]))  # Output: (0, 1)
print(sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: (10, 24)
```

Alternatively, you could also use the `math.prod` function (available in Python 3.8+) to calculate the product in a more concise way:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import math

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.

    Args:
    numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.

    Returns:
    Tuple[int, int]: A tuple containing the sum and product of the integers in the list.
    """
    total_sum = sum(numbers)
    product = math.prod(numbers, initial=1)
    return total_sum, product

# Example usage:
print(sum_product([]))  # Output: (0, 1)
print(sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: (10, 24)
```
