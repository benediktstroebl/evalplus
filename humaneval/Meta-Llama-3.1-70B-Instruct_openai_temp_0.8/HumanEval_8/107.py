```python

    """

    Args:

    Returns:

    """
    # Initialize sum and product with their respective identity values
    total_sum = 0
    total_product = 1
    
    # Iterate over each number in the list
    for num in numbers:
        # Add the current number to the total sum
        total_sum += num
        # Multiply the current number with the total product
        total_product *= num

Alternatively, you can use the built-in `sum` and `math.prod` functions in Python to achieve the same result in a more concise way:

```python
import math
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
    
    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.
    
    Returns:
        Tuple[int, int]: A tuple containing the sum and product of the input integers.
    """
    # Use the sum function to calculate the sum of the list
    total_sum = sum(numbers)
    
    # Use the math.prod function to calculate the product of the list
    # math.prod returns 1 for an empty list, which matches the problem's requirements
    total_product = math.prod(numbers, start=1)
    
    # Return the total sum and product as a tuple
    return total_sum, total_product

# Test the function
print(sum_product([]))  # Expected output: (0, 1)
print(sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Expected output: (10, 24)
```
