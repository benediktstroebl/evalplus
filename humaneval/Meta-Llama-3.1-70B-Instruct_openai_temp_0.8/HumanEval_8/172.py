### Solution
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    
    Args:
    numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.
    
    Returns:
    Tuple[int, int]: A tuple containing the sum and product of the input list.
    """
    
    # Initialize sum and product with the identities for these operations
    total_sum = 0
    total_product = 1
    
    # Iterate over each number in the list
    for num in numbers:
        # Add the current number to the total sum
        total_sum += num
        # Multiply the current number to the total product
        total_product *= num
    
    # Return the calculated sum and product as a tuple
    return total_sum, total_product

# Example usage:
print(sum_product([]))  # Output: (0, 1)
print(sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: (10, 24)
```

### Explanation

This script defines a function `sum_product` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the sum and product of all integers in the list. 

The function initializes the sum to 0 (the identity for addition) and the product to 1 (the identity for multiplication). It then iterates over each number in the list, updating the sum and product accordingly.

Finally, the function returns the calculated sum and product as a tuple.

### Alternative Solution

If you want a more concise solution using built-in Python functions, you can use the `sum` function for calculating the sum and the `math.prod` function (available in Python 3.8 and later) for calculating the product:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import math

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    
    Args:
    numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.
    
    Returns:
    Tuple[int, int]: A tuple containing the sum and product of the input list.
    """
    total_sum = sum(numbers)
    total_product = math.prod(numbers, start=1) if numbers else 1
    
    return total_sum, total_product
```
Note that the `math.prod` function is used with a `start` value of 1 to ensure that the product is correctly calculated even for empty lists.
