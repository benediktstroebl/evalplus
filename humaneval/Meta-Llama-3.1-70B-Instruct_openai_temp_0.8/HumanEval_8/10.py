```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.

    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        Tuple[int, int]: A tuple containing the sum and product of the input list.
    """
    total_sum = 0
    product = 1
    
    for num in numbers:
        total_sum += num
        product *= num
    
    return total_sum, product


# Test cases
print(sum_product([]))  # Expected output: (0, 1)
print(sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Expected output: (10, 24)
```

However, we can make this code more Pythonic by using the built-in `sum()` function for calculating the sum of the list and the `math.prod()` function for calculating the product. Here's the revised code:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import math

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.

    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        Tuple[int, int]: A tuple containing the sum and product of the input list.
    """
    total_sum = sum(numbers)
    product = math.prod(numbers, start=1)  # Use start=1 to handle empty lists
    
    return total_sum, product


# Test cases
print(sum_product([]))  # Expected output: (0, 1)
print(sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Expected output: (10, 24)
```
