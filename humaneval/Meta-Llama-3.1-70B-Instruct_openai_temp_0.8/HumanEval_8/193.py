```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.

    Args:
        numbers: A list of integers.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing the sum and product of the integers in the list.

    Examples:
        >>> sum_product([])
        (0, 1)
        >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
        (10, 24)
    """
    # Initialize sum and product to their respective identity values
    total_sum = 0
    total_product = 1

    # Iterate over each number in the list
    for num in numbers:
        # Add the number to the total sum
        total_sum += num
        # Multiply the total product by the number
        total_product *= num

    # Return the sum and product as a tuple
    return total_sum, total_product


# Test the function
print(sum_product([]))  # Expected output: (0, 1)
print(sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Expected output: (10, 24)
```

Alternatively, you can use the built-in `sum` function and the `math.prod` function (available in Python 3.8+) to make the code more concise:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import math

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.

    Args:
        numbers: A list of integers.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing the sum and product of the integers in the list.

    Examples:
        >>> sum_product([])
        (0, 1)
        >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
        (10, 24)
    """
    # Return the sum and product as a tuple
    return sum(numbers) if numbers else 0, math.prod(numbers) if numbers else 1


# Test the function
print(sum_product([]))  # Expected output: (0, 1)
print(sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Expected output: (10, 24)
```
