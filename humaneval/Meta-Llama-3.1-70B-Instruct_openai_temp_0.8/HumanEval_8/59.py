This script defines a function `sum_product` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the sum and product of the input list. The function initializes the sum and product with default values for an empty list and then iterates over each number in the list, updating the sum and product accordingly. The script also includes test cases to verify the correctness of the function.
