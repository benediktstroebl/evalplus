This script defines a function `sum_product` which calculates the sum and product of a list of integers. The `sum` function is used to calculate the sum, and a `for` loop is used to calculate the product. If the input list is empty, the function returns a tuple of (0, 1) as per the problem statement.

Alternatively, you can use the `math.prod` function (available in Python 3.8+) to calculate the product in a more concise way:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import math

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
    
    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
    (10, 24)
    """
    total_sum = sum(numbers)
    product = math.prod(numbers, start=1)
    return total_sum, product

# Example usage:
print(sum_product([]))  # Output: (0, 1)
print(sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: (10, 24)
