```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.

    Args:
        numbers: A list of integers.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing the sum and product of all integers in the list.
    """
    total_sum = 0
    total_product = 1

    for number in numbers:
        total_sum += number
        total_product *= number

    return total_sum, total_product


# Test cases
print(sum_product([]))  # Expected output: (0, 1)
print(sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Expected output: (10, 24)
```

Alternatively, you can use Python's built-in `sum` and `math.prod` functions to solve this problem more concisely:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import math

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.

    Args:
        numbers: A list of integers.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing the sum and product of all integers in the list.
    """
    total_sum = sum(numbers)
    total_product = math.prod(numbers) if numbers else 1  # math.prod returns 1 for empty lists in Python 3.8+

    return total_sum, total_product


# Test cases
print(sum_product([]))  # Expected output: (0, 1)
print(sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Expected output: (10, 24)
```
