```python

    """
    For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.

    Args:

    Returns:
        Tuple[int, int]: A tuple containing the sum and product of the integers in the list.
    """
    # Initialize sum and product with default values for empty lists

    # Return the total sum and product as a tuple
    return total_sum, total_product

# Test cases
print(sum_product([]))  # Expected output: (0, 1)

```

Alternatively, you can use the built-in `sum` function and the `math.prod` function (available in Python 3.8 and later) to make the code more concise:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import math

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.

    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        Tuple[int, int]: A tuple containing the sum and product of the integers in the list.
    """
    # Use the sum function to calculate the total sum
    total_sum = sum(numbers)
    
    # Use the math.prod function to calculate the total product
    # If the list is empty, math.prod returns 1 by default
    total_product = math.prod(numbers, start=1)
    
    # Return the total sum and product as a tuple
    return total_sum, total_product

# Test cases
print(sum_product([]))  # Expected output: (0, 1)
print(sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Expected output: (10, 24)
print(sum_product([-1, 1, -2, 2]))  # Expected output: (0, 4)
