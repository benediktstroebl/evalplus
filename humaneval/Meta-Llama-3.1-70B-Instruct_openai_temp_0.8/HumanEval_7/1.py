```python

    """
    Filter an input list of strings only for ones that contain given substring.

    Args:
        strings (List[str]): A list of strings to be filtered.
        substring (str): A substring to filter by.

    Returns:
        List[str]: A list of strings that contain the given substring.

    # Use list comprehension to create a new list with strings that contain the substring
    return [string for string in strings if substring in string]

```

This script defines a function `filter_by_substring` that takes a list of strings and a substring as input, and returns a new list containing only the strings that include the given substring. The function uses list comprehension to achieve this in a concise and readable way. The script also includes test cases to verify the correctness of the function.
