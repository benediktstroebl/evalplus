```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Filter an input list of strings only for ones that contain given substring.

    Args:
        strings (List[str]): The list of strings to be filtered.
        substring (str): The substring to search for.

    Returns:
        List[str]: A list of strings that contain the given substring.
    """
    return [string for string in strings if substring in string]


# Test cases
print(filter_by_substring([], 'a'))  # Expected output: []
print(filter_by_substring(['abc', 'bacd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a'))  # Expected output: ['abc', 'bacd', 'array']
```

This script defines a function `filter_by_substring` that takes a list of strings and a substring as input, and returns a new list containing only the strings that contain the given substring. The function uses a list comprehension to achieve this.

The script also includes two test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior. The first test case checks that an empty list is returned when the input list is empty. The second test case checks that the function correctly filters a list of strings based on the presence of the substring 'a'.
