This script works by dividing the input number `n` by the smallest prime factor `i` as long as it's divisible. The factor `i` is then added to the list of factors, and the process continues until `n` is no longer divisible by `i`. At this point, `i` is incremented by 1, and the process repeats. If `n` is a prime number greater than 1 at the end of the loop, it's added to the list of factors. The function returns the list of factors.
