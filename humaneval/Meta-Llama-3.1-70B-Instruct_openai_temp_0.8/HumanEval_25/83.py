This script defines the `factorize` function which finds the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It starts by checking divisibility from the smallest prime number, which is 2. If `n` is divisible by the current number `i`, it divides `n` by `i` and adds `i` to the list of factors. This process continues until `n` is reduced to 1. If `n` is still greater than 1 after the loop, it means `n` itself is a prime number and it is added to the list of factors.
