This script uses a simple trial division method to find the prime factors of the input number `n`. It starts by dividing `n` by the smallest prime number (2) and keeps dividing as long as `n` is divisible by the current divisor. It then increments the divisor until it finds the next number that can divide `n`. This process continues until `n` is reduced to 1. The list of divisors obtained through this process is the list of prime factors of the original number.
