This script defines a function `factorize` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors. The function works by dividing the input number `n` by the smallest prime number (2) as long as it's divisible. Then it increments the divisor until it finds the next number that can divide `n`, which will be a prime number. This process continues until `n` is reduced to 1. The list of divisors that were used to reduce `n` to 1 are the prime factors of `n`.

The test cases at the end of the script demonstrate the function's correctness by comparing its output to the expected output for the given examples.
