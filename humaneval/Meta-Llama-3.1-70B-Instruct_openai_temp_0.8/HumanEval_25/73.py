This script defines a function `factorize` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors. The function works by dividing the input number by the smallest prime number (2) as long as it's divisible. Then it increments the divisor until it finds the next number that can divide the input number, which will be a prime number. This process continues until the input number is reduced to 1. The list of divisors obtained through this process will be the list of prime factors of the input number.
