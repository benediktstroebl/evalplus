This script defines a function `factorize` that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of its prime factors. The function uses a helper function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime, but in this case, it's not actually needed because we're checking divisibility up to the square root of the number, which is a more efficient approach. The function iteratively checks for divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number and appends the divisor to the list of factors if it's divisible. If the remaining number is greater than 1, it's also appended to the list of factors. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's usage.
