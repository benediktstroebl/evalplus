This script works by dividing the input number `n` by the smallest divisor `i` as long as it's divisible. The divisor `i` is then added to the list of factors. This process is repeated until `n` is reduced to 1. If `n` is a prime number greater than 1 at the end of the loop, it means that it has no divisors other than 1 and itself, so it's added to the list of factors.
