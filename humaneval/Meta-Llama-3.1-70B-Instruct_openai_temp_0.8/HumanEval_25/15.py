```python

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors

    Args:
        n (int): The number to factorize.

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of prime factors.

    Examples:

        [2, 2, 2]
        >>> factorize(25)
        [5, 5]

This script defines a function `factorize` that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of its prime factors. The function works by dividing `n` by the smallest prime number (2) as long as it's divisible, then increments the divisor until it finds the next number that can divide `n`, and so on. The process continues until `n` is reduced to 1.

The script also includes example use cases in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
