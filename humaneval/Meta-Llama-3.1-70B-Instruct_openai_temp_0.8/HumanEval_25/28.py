This script defines a function `factorize` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors. It works by dividing the input number by the smallest divisor (starting from 2) until it is no longer divisible. The divisor is then added to the list of factors, and the process is repeated until the input number is reduced to 1. The remaining number (if greater than 1) is added to the list of factors as the largest prime factor.
