    """

    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.

        if num < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
            if num % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and is_prime(i):
            factors.append(i)
            n = n // i
            while n % i == 0 and is_prime(i):
                factors.append(i)
                n = n // i
    return factors

# Test the function
print(factorize(8))  # [2, 2, 2]
print(factorize(25))  # [5, 5]
print(factorize(70))  # [2, 5, 7]
```

However, we can optimize the script above using a more efficient algorithm for factorization. Here is the optimized code:

```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors

    :param n: The number to be factorized
    :return: A list of prime factors
    """
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors

# Test the function
print(factorize(8))  # [2, 2, 2]
print(factorize(25))  # [5, 5]
print(factorize(70))  # [2, 5, 7]
```

This version of the function works by dividing the input number `n` by the smallest prime factor (which is 2), and then continuing to divide by the smallest prime factor until `n` is reduced to 1. The result is a list of prime factors in ascending order, with each factor repeated according to its multiplicity.
