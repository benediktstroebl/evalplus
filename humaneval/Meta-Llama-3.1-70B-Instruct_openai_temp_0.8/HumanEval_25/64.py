This script works by dividing the input number `n` by the smallest prime number (2) as long as it's divisible. Then it increments the divisor until it finds the next number that can divide `n`, which will necessarily be a prime number. This process continues until `n` is reduced to 1. The list of divisors that were used to reduce `n` to 1 are the prime factors of `n`.
