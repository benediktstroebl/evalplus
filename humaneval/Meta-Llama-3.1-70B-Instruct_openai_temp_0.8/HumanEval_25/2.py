This script defines a function `factorize` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors. The function iterates from 2 to the square root of `n`, dividing `n` by any divisor it finds and appending that divisor to the list of factors. If `n` is not fully divided by the time the loop ends, it means `n` itself is a prime factor, so it is appended to the list. The function then returns the list of factors.
