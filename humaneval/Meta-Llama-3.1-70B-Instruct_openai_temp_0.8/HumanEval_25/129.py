This script defines a function `factorize` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors. The function works by dividing the input number `n` by the smallest divisor (starting from 2) as long as it's divisible. The divisor is then increased by 1 until it's no longer divisible. This process continues until `n` is reduced to 1. The list of divisors that were used to reduce `n` to 1 are the prime factors of `n`.

The test cases at the end of the script demonstrate how to use the `factorize` function and verify its output.
