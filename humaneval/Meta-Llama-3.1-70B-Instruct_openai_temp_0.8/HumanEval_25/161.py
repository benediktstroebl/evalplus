This script defines a function `factorize` that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of its prime factors in ascending order. It iterates from 2 to the square root of `n`, dividing `n` by each number `i` that is a factor of `n` and appending `i` to the list of factors. Finally, if `n` is greater than 1 (meaning it is a prime number), it appends `n` to the list of factors.
