This script works by dividing the input number `n` by the smallest prime factor `i` as long as it's divisible. The divisor `i` is then appended to the list of factors. This process continues until `n` is reduced to 1, at which point all its prime factors have been found. The last factor is appended to the list only if `n` is greater than 1 to avoid appending 1 to the list.

Note that this algorithm has a time complexity of O(âˆšn) which makes it efficient for large inputs.
