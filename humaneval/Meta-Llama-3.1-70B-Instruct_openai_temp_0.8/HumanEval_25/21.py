def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.

    Args:
        n (int): The number to factorize.

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of prime factors.

    Examples:
        >>> factorize(8)
        [2, 2, 2]
        >>> factorize(25)
        [5, 5]

This script uses a simple trial division method to find the prime factors of a given number. It starts with the smallest prime number (2) and divides the input number `n` by this number as long as it's divisible. Then it increments the divisor until it finds the next number that can divide `n`, which will necessarily be a prime number. This process continues until `n` is reduced to 1. The list of divisors obtained through this process will be the list of prime factors of the original number.
