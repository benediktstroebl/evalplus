In this script, we start with `i` equal to 2 (the smallest prime number) and keep dividing `n` by `i` as long as `n` is divisible by `i`. The results of the divisions are appended to the `factors` list. We then increment `i` and repeat the process until `n` is no longer divisible by `i`. We continue this process until `i` is greater than the square root of `n`, at which point `n` itself must be a prime factor if it is greater than 1.
