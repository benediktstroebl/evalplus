```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    >>> string_sequence(0)
    '0'
    >>> string_sequence(5)
    '0 1 2 3 4 5'
    """
    return''.join(map(str, range(n + 1)))

# Test cases
print(string_sequence(0))  # Expected output: '0'
print(string_sequence(5))  # Expected output: '0 1 2 3 4 5'
```

This script uses the built-in `range` function to generate numbers from 0 to `n` inclusive, converts each number to a string using `map`, and then joins these strings together with spaces in between using `join`. The result is a string containing space-delimited numbers as required.
