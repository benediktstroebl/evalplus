This script defines a function `string_sequence` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a string containing space-delimited numbers from 0 to `n` inclusive. It uses the built-in `range` function to generate the sequence of numbers, converts each number to a string using the `map` function, and then joins the strings together with spaces in between using the `join` method. The script also includes test cases to verify the correctness of the function.
