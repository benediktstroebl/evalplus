    Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit of the sequence.

    Returns:
        str: A string containing space-delimited numbers from 0 to n.

    Examples:
        >>> string_sequence(0)
        '0'
        >>> string_sequence(5)
        '0 1 2 3 4 5'

# Test the function
print(string_sequence(0))  # Output: 0
print(string_sequence(5))  # Output: 0 1 2 3 4 5

This script defines a function `string_sequence` that generates a string containing space-delimited numbers from 0 to `n` inclusive. It uses a generator expression within the `join` method to convert each number to a string and join them together with a space delimiter. The function includes a docstring that provides documentation and example usage. The script also includes test cases to verify the function's correctness.
