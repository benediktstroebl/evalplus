This script defines a function `rescale_to_unit` that takes a list of numbers as input, finds the minimum and maximum values, and applies a linear transformation to the list such that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. The function includes input validation to ensure the list has at least two elements. It also handles the case where the minimum and maximum values are equal, in which case the function returns a list of 1.0 values.
