```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Detects if the balance of a bank account falls below zero at any point given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations.

    Args:
    operations (List[int]): A list of integers representing deposit (positive) and withdrawal (negative) operations.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the balance falls below zero at any point, False otherwise.
    """
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False

# Example usage:
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
```

In this script, we initialize a `balance` variable to 0, representing the initial balance of the account. We then iterate over each operation in the list. For each operation, we add the operation amount to the balance. If the balance ever falls below 0, we immediately return `True`. If we complete the loop without the balance falling below 0, we return `False`.
