```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    This function checks if the balance of a bank account falls below zero at any point.

    Args:
    operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the balance falls below zero, False otherwise.
    """
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False

# Test cases
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
print(below_zero([-1, 2, 3]))  # True
print(below_zero([1, 1, 1]))  # False
```

In this script, we initialize the balance to zero and then iterate through each operation in the list. We add the operation to the balance and check if the balance is less than zero. If it is, we immediately return True. If we finish iterating through all operations without the balance falling below zero, we return False.
