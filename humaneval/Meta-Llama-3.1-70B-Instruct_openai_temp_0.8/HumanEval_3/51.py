    """
    This function checks if a bank account balance falls below zero at any point 
    given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations.

    Args:
    operations (List[int]): A list of integers representing deposit and withdrawal operations.
                            Positive values represent deposits, negative values represent withdrawals.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the balance falls below zero at any point, False otherwise.

            return True  # If it is, return True immediately
    return False  # If we've iterated over all operations and the balance never fell below zero, return False


# Example use cases:
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
print(below_zero([-1, -2, -3]))  # True
print(below_zero([0, 0, 0]))  # False
