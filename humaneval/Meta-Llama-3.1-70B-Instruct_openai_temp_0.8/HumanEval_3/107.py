This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of integers representing deposit and withdrawal operations. It initializes a balance variable to zero and iterates over each operation, updating the balance and checking if it falls below zero. If the balance falls below zero at any point, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The script includes test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
