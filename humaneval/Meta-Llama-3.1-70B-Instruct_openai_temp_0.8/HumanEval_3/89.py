    """
    This function checks if a bank account balance falls below zero at any point after a series of deposit and withdrawal operations.

    Args:
    operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations. Positive values represent deposits and negative values represent withdrawals.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the balance falls below zero at any point, False otherwise.

    balance = 0  # Initialize the balance to zero
    for operation in operations:  # Iterate over each operation

            return True  # If it is, return True immediately
    return False  # If we've iterated over all operations and the balance is never below zero, return False

# Example use cases:
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
print(below_zero([10, -5, -7, 1]))  # True
print(below_zero([5, 5, 5, 5]))  # False
