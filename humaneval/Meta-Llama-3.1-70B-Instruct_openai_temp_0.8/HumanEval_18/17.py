```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """
    Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string.
    Count overlapping cases.

    Args:
        string (str): The original string.
        substring (str): The substring to be searched.

    Returns:
        int: The number of times the substring can be found in the string.

    Examples:
        >>> how_many_times('', 'a')
        0
        >>> how_many_times('aaa', 'a')
        3
        >>> how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')
        3
    """
    if not substring:  # If substring is empty, return 0
        return 0

    count = 0
    start = 0
    while start < len(string):
        pos = string.find(substring, start)
        if pos!= -1:
            count += 1
            start = pos + 1
        else:
            break

    return count
```

You can run this script directly in Python to use the `how_many_times` function. The function works by iterating over the string and using the `find` method to locate the substring. If the substring is found, it increments the count and moves the start position to the character after the found substring to continue the search. If the substring is not found, it breaks out of the loop and returns the count.
