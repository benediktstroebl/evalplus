This script defines a function `how_many_times` that takes two strings as input and returns the number of times the second string can be found in the first, counting overlapping cases. It uses a simple iterative approach with the `find` method to locate the substring in the string, and increments the count each time a match is found. The `start` position is moved forward by one character after each match to allow for overlapping cases.
