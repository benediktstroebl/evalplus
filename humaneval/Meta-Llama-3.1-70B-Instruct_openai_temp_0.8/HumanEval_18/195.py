```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """
    Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string.
    Count overlapping cases.

    Args:
        string (str): The original string.
        substring (str): The substring to find.

    Returns:
        int: The number of times the substring is found.

    Examples:
        >>> how_many_times('', 'a')
        0
        >>> how_many_times('aaa', 'a')
        3
        >>> how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')
        3
    """
    if not substring:
        return 0
    count = 0
    start = 0
    while start < len(string):
        pos = string.find(substring, start)
        if pos!= -1:
            count += 1
            start = pos + 1
        else:
            break
    return count

# Test cases
print(how_many_times('', 'a'))  # 0
print(how_many_times('aaa', 'a'))  # 3
print(how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa'))  # 3
```

This Python script uses the built-in `str.find()` method to locate the substring within the original string. The search starts from the beginning of the string, and after each match, the search continues from the position right after the match to account for overlapping cases. If no match is found, the loop breaks, and the total count is returned.
