```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:

    Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string.

    string (str): The original string to search in.
    substring (str): The substring to search for.

    Returns:
    int: The number of times the substring can be found in the string.

This script defines a function `how_many_times` that counts the number of occurrences of a given substring in a string, including overlapping cases. It uses the `find` method to search for the substring in the string, starting from the current position `start`. If the substring is found, it increments the count and updates the starting position to continue searching from the next character. If the substring is not found, it breaks out of the loop and returns the count. The script includes test cases to demonstrate its usage and correctness.
