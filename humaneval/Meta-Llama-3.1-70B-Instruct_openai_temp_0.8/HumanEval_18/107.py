```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """
    Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string.
    Count overlapping cases.

    Args:
        string (str): The original string to search in.
        substring (str): The substring to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The number of times the substring can be found.

    Examples:
        >>> how_many_times('', 'a')
        0
        >>> how_many_times('aaa', 'a')
        3
        >>> how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')
        3
    """
    if not substring:
        raise ValueError("Substring cannot be empty")

    count = 0
    start = 0
    while start < len(string):
        pos = string.find(substring, start)
        if pos!= -1:
            count += 1
            start = pos + 1
        else:
            break

    return count
```

You can use this script as a standalone function. The `find` method in Python returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring, or `-1` if it's not found. By updating the `start` variable to be one greater than the found position, we ensure that overlapping cases are counted.
