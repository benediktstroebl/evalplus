This script defines a function `how_many_times` that takes a string and a substring as input, and returns the number of times the substring can be found in the string, counting overlapping cases. It uses the `find` method to search for the substring in the string, and keeps track of the number of matches. The test cases are included to demonstrate the function's behavior.
