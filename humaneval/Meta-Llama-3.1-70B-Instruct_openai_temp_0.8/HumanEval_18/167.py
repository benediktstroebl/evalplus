This script defines the `how_many_times` function, which takes a string and a substring as input and returns the number of times the substring can be found in the string, counting overlapping cases. The function uses a while loop to iterate over the string, finding the substring at each position and moving the start position forward to allow overlapping matches. If the substring is not found, the loop breaks and the function returns the count. The script also includes test cases to verify the function's correctness.
