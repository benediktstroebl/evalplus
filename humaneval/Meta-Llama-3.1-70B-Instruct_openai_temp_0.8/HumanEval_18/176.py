This script defines a function `how_many_times` that takes a string and a substring as input and returns the number of times the substring appears in the string, including overlapping cases. It uses the `find` method to search for the substring in the string, starting from the current position. If the substring is found, it increments the count and moves to the next position. If the substring is not found, it breaks the loop. The function returns the count.

You can save this script to a file (e.g., `substring_count.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python substring_count.py`) to test the function.
