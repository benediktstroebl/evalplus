This script defines a function `how_many_times` that uses the `find` method of the string class to search for the substring in the original string. The `find` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring, or -1 if it's not found. The function iterates over the string, moving the start position after each match to allow for overlapping matches. The test cases demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs.
