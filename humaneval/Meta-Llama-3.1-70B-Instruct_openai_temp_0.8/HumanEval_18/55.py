    Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string.
    Count overlapping cases.

    Args:
        string (str): The original string to search in.
        substring (str): The substring to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The number of times the substring is found in the string.

    if not substring:  # if substring is empty, return 0
        return 0

    count = 0
    start = 0
    while start < len(string):
        pos = string.find(substring, start)
        if pos!= -1:
            count += 1
            start = pos + 1  # move the start pointer one position forward
        else:
            break

    return count

# Test cases
print(how_many_times('', 'a'))  # 0
print(how_many_times('aaa', 'a'))  # 3
print(how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa'))  # 3
```

In this script, we use the `find` method of the string to search for the substring. If the substring is found, we increment the count and move the start pointer one position forward to account for overlapping cases. If the substring is not found, we break out of the loop. This way, we ensure that we count all occurrences of the substring, including overlapping ones.
