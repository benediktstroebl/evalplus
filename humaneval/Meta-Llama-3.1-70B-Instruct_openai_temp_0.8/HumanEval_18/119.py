```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """
    Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string.
    Count overlapping cases.

    Args:
        string (str): The original string to search in.
        substring (str): The substring to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The number of times the substring is found in the string.

    Examples:
        >>> how_many_times('', 'a')
        0
        >>> how_many_times('aaa', 'a')
        3

This script defines a function `how_many_times` that takes a string and a substring as input, and returns the number of times the substring is found in the string, including overlapping cases. It uses the `find` method to search for the substring in the string, and increments a counter each time it is found. The `start` variable is used to keep track of the current position in the string, and is incremented to the next character after each match. The function returns the count when the end of the string is reached.
