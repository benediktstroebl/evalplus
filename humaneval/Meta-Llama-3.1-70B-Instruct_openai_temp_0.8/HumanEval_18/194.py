This script defines a function `how_many_times` that takes two strings as input: the original string and the substring to search for. It returns the number of times the substring can be found in the string, counting overlapping cases.

The function uses a simple iterative approach: it starts at the beginning of the string and repeatedly searches for the substring using the `find` method. If the substring is found, it increments the count and moves the start position to the next character. If the substring is not found, it breaks the loop.

The script also includes three test cases to verify the function's behavior.
