```

This script uses the `find` method of the string class, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring. If the substring is not found, it returns -1. By incrementing the start index after each found occurrence, we can count overlapping cases. The loop continues until the end of the string is reached or the substring is not found anymore.
