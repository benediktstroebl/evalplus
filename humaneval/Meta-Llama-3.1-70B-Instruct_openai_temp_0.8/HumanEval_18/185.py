This script defines a function `how_many_times` that takes a string and a substring as input. It uses the `find` method to find the position of the substring in the string, starting from the current position. If the substring is found, it increments the count and moves the start position to the next character. This process is repeated until the end of the string is reached. The function returns the total count of the substring.
