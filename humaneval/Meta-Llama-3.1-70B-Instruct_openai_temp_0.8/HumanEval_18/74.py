```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """
    Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string.
    Count overlapping cases.

    Args:
        string (str): The original string to search in.
        substring (str): The substring to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The number of times the substring is found in the string.

    Examples:
        >>> how_many_times('', 'a')
        0
        >>> how_many_times('aaa', 'a')
        3
        >>> how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')
        3

This script uses the built-in `find` method of Python strings to find the position of the substring in the string, starting from the current position `start`. If the substring is found, it increments the count and moves the start position to the character after the found substring. If the substring is not found, it breaks the loop and returns the count.
