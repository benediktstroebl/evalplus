This script defines a function `how_many_times` that takes a string and a substring as input, and returns the number of times the substring appears in the string, counting overlapping cases. It uses the `find` method to search for the substring in the string, and increments a counter each time the substring is found. The `start` variable is used to keep track of the current position in the string. The function returns the count of substring occurrences.

The test cases at the end of the script demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs.
