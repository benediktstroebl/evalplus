```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """
    Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string.
    Count overlapping cases.

    Args:
        string (str): The original string to search in.
        substring (str): The substring to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The number of times the substring appears in the string.

    Examples:
        >>> how_many_times('', 'a')
        0
        >>> how_many_times('aaa', 'a')
        3
        >>> how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')
        3

This script defines a function `how_many_times` that counts the occurrences of a substring within a string, including overlapping cases. It iterates through the string, using the `find` method to locate the substring and incrementing a counter each time a match is found. The function returns the total count. The test cases provided demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs.
