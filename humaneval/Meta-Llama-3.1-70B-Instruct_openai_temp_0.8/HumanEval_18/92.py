    Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string.

This script defines a function `how_many_times` that takes two arguments: `string` and `substring`. It uses the `find` method of the string to search for the substring, starting from the current position `start`. If the substring is found, it increments the count and updates the start position to be one character after the found substring. If the substring is not found, it breaks out of the loop. The function returns the count of how many times the substring was found.
