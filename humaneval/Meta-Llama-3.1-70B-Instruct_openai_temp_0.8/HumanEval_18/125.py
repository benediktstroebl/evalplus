This script defines a function `how_many_times` that takes two parameters: `string` and `substring`. It uses a while loop to iterate over the string, using the `find` method to locate the substring. If the substring is found, it increments the count and moves to the next character in the string. If the substring is not found, it breaks the loop. Finally, it returns the count.

The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's usage and verify its correctness.
