This script defines a function `how_many_times` that takes a string and a substring as input, and returns the number of times the substring appears in the string, counting overlapping cases. The function uses a while loop to iterate over the string, finding the substring at each position and incrementing the count if found. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's correctness.
