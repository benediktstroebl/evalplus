```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """
    Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string.
    Count overlapping cases.

    Args:
        string (str): The original string to search in.
        substring (str): The substring to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The number of times the substring can be found in the string.
    """
    count = 0
    start = 0
    while start < len(string):
        pos = string.find(substring, start)
        if pos!= -1:
            count += 1
            start = pos + 1
        else:
            break
    return count

# Example use cases:
print(how_many_times('', 'a'))  # 0
print(how_many_times('aaa', 'a'))  # 3
print(how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa'))  # 3
```

This script works by using a while loop to continuously search for the substring in the string, starting from the current position. If the substring is found, the count is incremented and the position is moved forward by one character. If the substring is not found, the loop breaks and the final count is returned. This approach ensures that overlapping cases are also counted.
