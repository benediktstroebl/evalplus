```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """
    Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string.
    Count overlapping cases.

    Args:
    string (str): The original string.
    substring (str): The substring to be searched.

    Returns:
    int: The number of times the substring can be found in the original string.
    """
    if not substring:  # if substring is empty, return 0
        return 0
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(string) - len(substring) + 1):
        if string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring:
            count += 1
    return count

# Test cases
print(how_many_times('', 'a'))  # 0
print(how_many_times('aaa', 'a'))  # 3
print(how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa'))  # 3
```

This script works by iterating over each character in the string that could potentially be the start of the substring. It checks if the substring matches the characters at that position, and if so, increments a counter. The count is then returned as the result. 

However, a more efficient solution using Python's built-in `str` methods can be achieved using the following alternative implementation:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """
    Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string.
    Count overlapping cases.

    Args:
    string (str): The original string.
    substring (str): The substring to be searched.

    Returns:
    int: The number of times the substring can be found in the original string.
    """
    if not substring:  # if substring is empty, return 0
        return 0
    count = start = 0
    while start < len(string):
        pos = string.find(substring, start)
        if pos!= -1:
            start = pos + 1
            count += 1
        else:
            break
    return count

# Test cases
print(how_many_times('', 'a'))  # 0
print(how_many_times('aaa', 'a'))  # 3
print(how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa'))  # 3
```

And the most efficient solution in Python:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """
    Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string.
    Count overlapping cases.

    Args:
    string (str): The original string.
    substring (str): The substring to be searched.

    Returns:
    int: The number of times the substring can be found in the original string.
    """
    return string.count(substring)

# Test cases
print(how_many_times('', 'a'))  # 0
print(how_many_times('aaa', 'a'))  # 3
print(how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa'))  # 3
```
