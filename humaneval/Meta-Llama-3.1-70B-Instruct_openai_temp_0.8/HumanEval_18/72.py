```

This script defines the `how_many_times` function as specified in the problem. It uses the `find` method of strings to locate the substring in the original string, and increments a counter each time a match is found. To allow for overlapping matches, the `start` position is moved to the next character after each match.

The script also includes test cases to verify the correct behavior of the function.
