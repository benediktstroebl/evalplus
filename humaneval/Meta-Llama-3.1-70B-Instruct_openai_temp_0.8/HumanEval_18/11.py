```python

    Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string.

    Args:
        string (str): The original string.
        substring (str): The substring to be searched.

    Returns:
        int: The number of times the substring appears in the string.

# Test cases
print(how_many_times('', 'a'))  # Expected output: 0

```

This script defines a function `how_many_times` that takes a string and a substring as input and returns the number of times the substring appears in the string, including overlapping cases. It then runs three test cases to verify the function's correctness.
