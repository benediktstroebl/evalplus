```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """
    Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string.
    Count overlapping cases.

    Args:
        string (str): The original string.
        substring (str): The substring to be searched.

    Returns:
        int: The number of times the substring appears in the string.

    count = 0
    start = 0
    while start < len(string):
        pos = string.find(substring, start)
        if pos!= -1:
            count += 1
            start = pos + 1
        else:
            break
    return count

# Test cases
print(how_many_times('', 'a'))  # Expected output: 0
print(how_many_times('aaa', 'a'))  # Expected output: 3
print(how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa'))  # Expected output: 3
```

This script uses a simple while loop to continuously search for the substring in the original string, starting from the position after the previous match. If a match is found, the count is incremented and the search continues from the next position. If no match is found, the loop breaks and the function returns the count.
