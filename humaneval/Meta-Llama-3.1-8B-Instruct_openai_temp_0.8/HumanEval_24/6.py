```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """
    For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n
    
    Args:
        n (int): The input number
    
    Returns:
        int: The largest divisor of n smaller than n
    
    Example:
        >>> largest_divisor(15)
        5
    """
    # Start from the largest possible divisor (n-1) and check if it is a divisor of n
    for i in range(n - 1, 1, -1):
        # Check if i is a divisor of n
        if n % i == 0:
            # If i is a divisor, return it as the largest divisor
            return i
    # If no divisors are found, return 1 (the smallest possible divisor)
    return 1

# Test the function
print(largest_divisor(15))  # Output: 5
print(largest_divisor(17))  # Output: 1

However, a more efficient way to solve this problem is to use the following approach:

```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """
    For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n
    
    Args:
        n (int): The input number
    
    Returns:
        int: The largest divisor of n smaller than n
    
    Example:
        >>> largest_divisor(15)
        5
    """
    # Start from n-1 and check if it is a divisor of n
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        # Check if i is a divisor of n
        if n % i == 0:
            # If i is a divisor, return it as the largest divisor
            return i
    # If no divisors are found, return 1 (the smallest possible divisor)
    return 1

# Test the function
print(largest_divisor(15))  # Output: 5
print(largest_divisor(17))  # Output: 1
print(largest_divisor(24))  # Output: 12
```

However, this problem can be solved even more efficiently using the math.gcd function (Greatest Common Divisor):

```python
import math

def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """
    For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n
    
    Args:
        n (int): The input number
    
    Returns:
        int: The largest divisor of n smaller than n
    
    Example:
        >>> largest_divisor(15)
        5
    """
    # Calculate the gcd of n and n-1
    gcd = math.gcd(n, n - 1)
    # If the gcd is n, return 1 (since n has no divisors smaller than itself)
    if gcd == n:
        return 1
    # Otherwise, return the gcd
    return gcd

# Test the function
print(largest_divisor(15))  # Output: 5
print(largest_divisor(17))  # Output: 1
print(largest_divisor(24))  # Output: 12
