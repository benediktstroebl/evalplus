def encode_cyclic(s: str):

    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.

    This function splits the input string into groups of three characters,

    three characters, it remains unchanged.

def decode_cyclic(s: str):

    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.

    This function works by considering characters at even and odd indices separately. 
    For a character at an even index, if it comes from an encoded group of length 3, 
    its corresponding character in the decoded string will be the first character 
    of its group. If it comes from an encoded group of length less than 3, its 
    corresponding character in the decoded string will be the same.

    For a character at an odd index, if it comes from an encoded group of length 3, 
    its corresponding character in the decoded string will be the last character 
    of its group. If it comes from an encoded group of length less than 3, its 
    corresponding character in the decoded string will be the last character of 
    its group, unless the group has only one character, in which case it remains

This script includes the `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions as described. The `decode_cyclic` function was implemented based on the provided description of how it should work. 

Note that this solution does not cover all edge cases and assumptions were made about the problem. The `decode_cyclic` function assumes that the input string is
