### Cyclic Encoding and Decoding

Below is a Python script that contains `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions.

```python
def encode_cyclic(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.
    """
    # Check if the input string is empty
    if not s:
        return s
    
    # Split the string into groups of three characters
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    
    # Cycle elements in each group unless the group has fewer elements than 3
    groups = [(group[1:] + group[0]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    
    return "".join(groups)


def decode_cyclic(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    decoded_string = ""
    temp = ""
    
    # Iterate over each character in the encoded string
    for char in s:
        temp += char
        
        # When a group of 3 is formed, add it to the decoded string and reset temp
        if len(temp) == 3:
            decoded_string += temp
            temp = ""
    
    # Add any remaining characters to the decoded string
    decoded_string += temp
    
    # Decode the cyclic groups back to their original order
    decoded_string = "".join([decoded_string[i:i+3] for i in range(0, len(decoded_string), 3)])
    
    return decoded_string


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    encoded_string = encode_cyclic("abcdefg")
    print("Encoded string:", encoded_string)
    
    decoded_string = decode_cyclic(encoded_string)
    print("Decoded string:", decoded_string)
```

This script defines two functions: `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`. The `encode_cyclic` function takes a string as input, splits it into groups of three characters, cycles the elements in each group, and returns the encoded string. The `decode_cyclic` function takes the encoded string as input, decodes the cyclic groups back to their original order, and returns the decoded string. The example usage demonstrates how to use these functions to encode and decode a string.
