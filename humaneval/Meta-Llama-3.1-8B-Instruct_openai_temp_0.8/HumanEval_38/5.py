### Cyclic Encoding and Decoding
#### Overview

This Python script provides functions to encode and decode a string by cycling groups of three characters.

#### Code

```python
def encode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    Returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.
    
    :param s: Input string to be encoded.
    :return: Encoded string.
    """
    # Split string into groups of three characters. Pad with spaces if necessary.
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] +'' * (3 - len(s) % 3) for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    # Cycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
    groups = [(group[1:] + group[0]).rstrip() if len(group) == 3 else group.rstrip() for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups).replace(' ', '')


def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    Takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.
    
    :param s: Input encoded string.
    :return: Decoded string.
    """
    # Split encoded string into groups of three characters.
    groups = [s[3 * i:3 * (i + 1)] for i in range(len(s) // 3)]
    # Remove any spaces that were added during encoding.
    groups = [group.rstrip() for group in groups]
    # Cycle elements in each group to undo the cycling done during encoding.
    groups = [(group[1:] + group[0]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups)

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    original_string = "abcdefghij"
    encoded_string = encode_cyclic(original_string)
    print(f"Original String: {original_string}")
    print(f"Encoded String: {encoded_string}")
    decoded_string = decode_cyclic(encoded_string)
    print(f"Decoded String: {decoded_string}")
```

#### Explanation

This script defines two functions: `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`. The `encode_cyclic` function takes a string as input, splits it into groups of three characters, cycles the elements in each group, and returns the encoded string. The `decode_cyclic` function works in reverse to recover the original string.

The `encode_cyclic` function adds spaces to the end of the string if necessary to make its length a multiple of three, then cycles the elements in each group. The `decode_cyclic` function removes any spaces that were added during encoding, then cycles the elements in each group to undo the cycling done during encoding.

The example usage demonstrates how to use these functions to encode and decode a string.
