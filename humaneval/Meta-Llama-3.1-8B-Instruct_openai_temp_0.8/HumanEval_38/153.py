### Cyclic Encoding and Decoding in Python
```python
def encode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    Returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.

    Args:
    s (str): The input string to be encoded.

    Returns:
    str: The encoded string.
    """
    # Split string into groups, each of length 3, filling with padding if needed.
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    # Cycle elements in each group, unless group has fewer elements than 3.
    groups = [(group[1:] + group[0]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups)


def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    Takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.

    Args:
    s (str): The encoded string to be decoded.

    Returns:
    str: The decoded string.
    """
    # Split the encoded string into groups, each of length 3, filling with padding if needed.
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    # To reconstruct the original string, simply join the groups back together.
    return "".join(groups)


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test the encoding and decoding functions.
    original_string = "abcdefghi"
    encoded_string = encode_cyclic(original_string)
    decoded_string = decode_cyclic(encoded_string)

    print(f"Original String: {original_string}")
    print(f"Encoded String: {encoded_string}")
    print(f"Decoded String: {decoded_string}")
```
This script contains the `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions as well as example usage for testing these functions.

**Key Points:**

1.  **Grouping**: In both functions, the input string is split into groups, each of length 3. Padding is added if the string's length is not divisible by 3.
2.  **Cycling**: In `encode_cyclic`, each group of length 3 is cycled, meaning the first element is moved to the end of the group.
3.  **Decoding**: In `decode_cyclic`, the encoded string is simply split back into groups without any cycling or other modifications, effectively reversing the encoding process.

**Commit Message**: "Added cyclic encoding and decoding functions in Python with example usage."
