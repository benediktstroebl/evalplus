Here's the complete code snippet with the `decode_cyclic` function implemented:

```python
def encode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.
    """
    # split string to groups. Each of length 3.
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    # cycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
    groups = [(group[1:] + group[0]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups)


def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    # split string to groups. Each of length 3.
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    encoded_groups = []
    # cycle elements in each group in reverse order to obtain the original order
    for group in groups:
        if len(group) == 3:
            encoded_groups.append(group[-1] + group[1:])
        else:
            encoded_groups.append(group)
    return "".join(encoded_groups)


def main():
    # test encode and decode functions
    original_string = "Hello World"
    encoded_string = encode_cyclic(original_string)
    print(f"Encoded string: {encoded_string}")
    decoded_string = decode_cyclic(encoded_string)
    print(f"Decoded string: {decoded_string}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The `decode_cyclic` function works by reversing the operation performed by `encode_cyclic`. If a group has 3 elements, it swaps the first and third elements. To reverse this operation, we swap the second and first elements of the group. This way, we effectively reverse the order of elements in each group that had 3 elements, resulting in the original order.
