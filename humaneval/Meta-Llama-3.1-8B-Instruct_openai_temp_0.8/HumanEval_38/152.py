### Cyclic String Encoding and Decoding
#### Python Implementation
```python
def encode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    Encodes a string by cycling groups of three characters.

    Args:
    s (str): The input string to be encoded.

    Returns:

    # Cycle elements in each group, unless the group has fewer elements than three
    groups = [(group[1:] + group[0]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    
    return "".join(groups)


def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    Decodes a string that was encoded using the encode_cyclic function.

    Args:
    s (str): The encoded string to be decoded.

    Returns:
    str: The decoded string.

# Example usage:
encoded_string = encode_cyclic("hello world")
print(f"Encoded String: {encoded_string}")

decoded_string = decode_cyclic(encoded_string)
print(f"Decoded String: {decoded_string}")
```
This script defines two functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, which implement the cyclic string encoding and decoding algorithm. The `encode_cyclic` function splits the input string into groups of three characters each and cycles the elements in each group. The `decode_cyclic` function reverses this process by iterating over the characters in the encoded string, adding them to groups, and then reconstructing the original string by alternating between the first and last characters of each group. The script also includes an example usage of these functions.
