### Cyclic Encoding and Decoding in Python

Below is the complete Python script that includes both the `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions. The `decode_cyclic` function is implemented to handle both cases when the input string is encoded with an even or odd number of groups.

```python
def encode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    Returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.
    
    Example:
    >>> encode_cyclic("abcdef")
    'bcdefa'
    """
    # Split string to groups. Each of length 3.
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    # Cycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
    groups = [(group[1:] + group[0]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups)


def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    Takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.
    
    Example:
    >>> decode_cyclic("bcdefa")
    'abcdef'
    """
    # Initialize an empty list to store decoded groups
    decoded_groups = []
    
    # Split the input string into groups of three characters
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    
    # For each group, append the first character and remaining characters in reverse order
    for group in groups:
        if len(group) == 3:
            decoded_groups.append(group[0] + group[2] + group[1])
        else:
            decoded_groups.append(group)
    
    # Join the decoded groups into a single string and return
    return "".join(decoded_groups)


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    original_string = "abcdef"
    encoded_string = encode_cyclic(original_string)
    print(f"Encoded string: {encoded_string}")
    
    decoded_string = decode_cyclic(encoded_string)
    print(f"Decoded string: {decoded_string}")
    
    assert original_string == decoded_string, f"Decoded string is incorrect: {decoded_string}"
    print("Assertion passed: Original string matches decoded string")
```

In this code:

1.  We define the `encode_cyclic` function, which splits the input string into groups of three characters and cycles the elements within each group.
2.  We define the `decode_cyclic` function, which reverses the process by appending the first character and remaining characters in reverse order to each group.
3.  We provide example usage in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to demonstrate the encoding and decoding process.
4.  We include an assertion to verify that the decoded string matches the original string.
