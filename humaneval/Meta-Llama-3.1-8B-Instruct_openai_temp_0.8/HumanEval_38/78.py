### Cyclic Encoding and Decoding in Python
```python
def encode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    Returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.

    :param s: input string
    :return: encoded string
    """
    # Split string to groups. Each of length 3.
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    # Cycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
    groups = [(group[1:] + group[0]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups)


def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    Takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.

    :param s: encoded string
    :return: decoded string
    """
    # Split string to groups. Each of length 3.
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    # Decycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
    groups = [(group[-1] + group[:-1]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups)


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    original_string = "HelloWorldPython"
    encoded_string = encode_cyclic(original_string)
    print(f"Encoded string: {encoded_string}")

    decoded_string = decode_cyclic(encoded_string)
    print(f"Decoded string: {decoded_string}")

    assert encoded_string == "ellWoPdhrloytnyH"
    assert decoded_string == original_string
```
The provided code defines two functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, which implement cyclic encoding and decoding respectively. The `encode_cyclic` function splits the input string into groups of three characters, cycles each group, and joins them back into a string. The `decode_cyclic` function does the reverse operation, i.e., it splits the encoded string into groups, decycles each group, and joins them back into a string.

The example usage demonstrates how to use these functions to encode and decode a string. It also includes assertions to verify that the encoding and decoding process is correct.
