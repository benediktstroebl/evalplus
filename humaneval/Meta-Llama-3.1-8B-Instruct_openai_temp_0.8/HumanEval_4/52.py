### Mean Absolute Deviation Calculation in Python

#### Code
```python
from typing import List
import statistics

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of this dataset.

    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The mean absolute deviation.

    Example:
        >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
        1.0
    """
    # Calculate the mean of the given numbers
    mean = statistics.mean(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the absolute deviation from the mean for each number
    absolute_deviations = [abs(num - mean) for num in numbers]
    
    # Calculate the mean of the absolute deviations
    mad = statistics.mean(absolute_deviations)
    
    return mad

# Example usage:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))
```

#### Explanation

This Python script calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a given list of numbers. The MAD is a measure of the average absolute difference between each element and the mean of the dataset.

This script uses the built-in `statistics` module to calculate the mean of the given numbers and the mean of the absolute deviations. The absolute deviation of each number from the mean is calculated using a list comprehension. The final MAD is then calculated by taking the mean of these absolute deviations.
