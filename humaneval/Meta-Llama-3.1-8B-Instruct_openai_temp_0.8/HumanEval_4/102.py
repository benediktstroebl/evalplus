    """
    For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    
    Args:
    numbers: A list of floating point numbers.
    
    Returns:
    The Mean Absolute Deviation of the input list.
    
    Example:
    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
    1.0
    """

    # Calculate the mean of the input list
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

    absolute_deviations = [abs(num - mean) for num in numbers]
    
    # Calculate the mean of the absolute deviations

This script defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation of a given list of numbers. It first calculates the mean of the input list, then calculates the absolute difference between each element and the mean, and finally calculates the mean of these absolute differences. The function returns this final value, which is the Mean Absolute Deviation.
