### Mean Absolute Deviation Calculation
#### Python Script

```markdown
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.

    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The Mean Absolute Deviation of the input list.

    Example:
        >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
        1.0
    """

    # Calculate the mean of the input list
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

    # Calculate the absolute deviation from the mean for each number
    absolute_deviations = [abs(num - mean) for num in numbers]

    # Calculate the mean of the absolute deviations
    mad = sum(absolute_deviations) / len(absolute_deviations)

    return mad

# Example usage:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))  # Output: 1.0
```

In this script, we first calculate the mean of the input list by summing all the numbers and dividing by the total count. Then, we calculate the absolute deviation from the mean for each number using a list comprehension. Finally, we calculate the mean of these absolute deviations to get the Mean Absolute Deviation.
