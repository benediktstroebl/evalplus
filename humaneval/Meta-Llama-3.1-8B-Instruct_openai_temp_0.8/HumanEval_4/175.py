### Mean Absolute Deviation Calculator
#### A Python Script to Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.

    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The Mean Absolute Deviation of the input list.

    Example:
        >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
        1.0
    """
    # Calculate the mean of the input numbers
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the absolute deviations from the mean
    deviations = [abs(num - mean) for num in numbers]
    
    # Calculate the mean of the deviations
    mad = sum(deviations) / len(deviations)
    
    return mad

# Example usage:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))  # Output: 1.0
```
This script defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation of the list. The function first calculates the mean of the input numbers, then calculates the absolute deviations from the mean, and finally returns the mean of the deviations. The example usage at the end demonstrates how to use the function.
