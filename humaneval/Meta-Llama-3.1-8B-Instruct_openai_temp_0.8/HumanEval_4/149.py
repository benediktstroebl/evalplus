### Mean Absolute Deviation Calculator

```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation 
    around the mean of this dataset.
    
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each 
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    
    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of float numbers.
    
    Returns:
        float: The Mean Absolute Deviation of the input list.
    
    Example:
        >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
        1.0
    """
    # Calculate the mean of the input list
    mean = np.mean(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the absolute differences between each element and the mean
    abs_diffs = [abs(num - mean) for num in numbers]
    
    # Calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation
    mad = np.mean(abs_diffs)
    
    return mad

# Example usage:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))  # Output: 1.0
```

This script uses the NumPy library for efficient numerical computations. It defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation of a given list of numbers. The example usage demonstrates how to use this function with an example list of numbers.
