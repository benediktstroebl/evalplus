### Calculating Mean Absolute Deviation in Python
```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.

    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The Mean Absolute Deviation.

    Example:
        >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
        1.0
    """
    # Calculate the mean of the input list
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the absolute difference between each element and the mean
    absolute_deviations = [abs(num - mean) for num in numbers]
    
    # Calculate the average of these absolute differences
    mad = sum(absolute_deviations) / len(absolute_deviations)
    
    return mad

# Example usage:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))
```
This script defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes a list of numbers as input. It calculates the mean of the input list, then calculates the absolute difference between each element and the mean. Finally, it returns the average of these absolute differences, which is the Mean Absolute Deviation. The script includes example usage and docstrings for clarity.
