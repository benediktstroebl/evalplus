    For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.

    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The Mean Absolute Deviation of the input list.

numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))  # Output: 1.0
```

This script defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation of a given list of numbers. It then demonstrates the function's usage with an example list of numbers.
