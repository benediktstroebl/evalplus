    """
    For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    
    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of numbers.
    
    Returns:
        float: The Mean Absolute Deviation of the input numbers.
    
    Example:
        >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
        1.0

This script uses NumPy for efficient numerical computations. The `mean_absolute_deviation` function calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation of a given list of numbers. It first calculates the mean of the numbers, then the absolute differences between each number and the mean, and finally the Mean Absolute Deviation by averaging these differences. The result is returned as a float.
