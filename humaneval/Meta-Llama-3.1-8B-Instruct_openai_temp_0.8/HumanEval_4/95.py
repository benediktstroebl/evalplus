```python
from typing import List
import statistics


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
    1.0
    """
    # Calculate the mean of the given numbers
    mean = statistics.mean(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the absolute differences between each number and the mean
    absolute_differences = [abs(num - mean) for num in numbers]
    
    # Calculate the mean of the absolute differences
    mad = statistics.mean(absolute_differences)
    
    return mad


# Example usage:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))  # Output: 1.0
```

However, this solution doesn't use the formula for MAD. The formula is `MAD = (1/n) * Î£|x_i - x_mean|`. Here is a revised version of the solution:

```python
from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
    1.0
    """
    # Calculate the mean of the given numbers
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the sum of the absolute differences between each number and the mean
    absolute_differences_sum = sum(abs(num - mean) for num in numbers)
    
    # Calculate the MAD
    mad = absolute_differences_sum / len(numbers)
    
    return mad


# Example usage:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))  # Output: 1.0
