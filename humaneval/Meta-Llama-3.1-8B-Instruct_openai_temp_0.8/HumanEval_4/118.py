    For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation

    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each

    Args:
        numbers: A list of float numbers.

    Returns:
        The Mean Absolute Deviation of the input numbers.

    Example:
        >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
        1.0
