### Mean Absolute Deviation Calculator
#### Overview
This Python script calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a given list of numbers.
MAD is a measure of the average absolute difference between each element and the mean of the dataset.

#### Code

```python
from typing import List
import statistics  # Utilize statistics module for mean calculation

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of this dataset.

    Args:
    numbers (List[float]): A list of input numbers.

    Returns:
    float: The Mean Absolute Deviation of the input numbers.
    """
    # Calculate the mean of the input numbers
    mean = statistics.mean(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the absolute difference between each number and the mean
    absolute_diffs = [abs(num - mean) for num in numbers]
    
    # Calculate the mean of the absolute differences (Mean Absolute Deviation)
    mad = statistics.mean(absolute_diffs)
    
    return mad

# Example usage:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))
```

#### Explanation
This script calculates the MAD in the following steps:
1. It uses the `statistics.mean()` function to calculate the mean of the input list of numbers.
2. It calculates the absolute difference between each number and the mean using a list comprehension.
3. It calculates the mean of the absolute differences, which is the Mean Absolute Deviation.

#### Advice
For larger datasets, consider using the `numpy` library, which provides efficient vectorized operations for calculations like this.
