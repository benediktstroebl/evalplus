This script defines a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation of a given list of numbers. It first calculates the mean of the input list, then calculates the absolute deviation of each number from the mean, and finally returns the mean of these absolute deviations. The script also includes an example usage to demonstrate how to use the function.
