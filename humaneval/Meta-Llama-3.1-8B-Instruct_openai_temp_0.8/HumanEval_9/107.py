Here's a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum element found until given moment
    in the sequence.

    Args:
        numbers: A list of integers.

    Returns:
        A list of rolling maximum elements.

    Example:
        >>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])
        [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
    """
    result = [max(numbers[:i+1]) for i in range(len(numbers))]
    return result

# Test the function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]
print(rolling_max(numbers))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
```
This script defines a function `rolling_max` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing the rolling maximum elements. It uses a list comprehension to generate the result. The test at the end checks that the function works correctly for the example provided.
