### Rolling Maximum Element
#### Problem Statement
From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum element found until given moment in the sequence.

#### Solution
```python
from typing import List

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum element found until given moment
    in the sequence.

    Args:
    numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.

    Returns:
    List[int]: A list of rolling maximum elements found in the input sequence.

    Example:
    >>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])
    [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
    """
    # Initialize the result list with the first element of the input list
    result = [numbers[0]]

    # Iterate over the input list starting from the second element
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        # Update the result list with the maximum of the current number and the last element in the result list
        result.append(max(num, result[-1]))

    return result

# Test the function
print(rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
```
This solution uses a simple iterative approach to maintain the rolling maximum at each step. It starts with the first element of the input list and then iteratively updates the result list by taking the maximum of the current number and the last element in the result list. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list.
