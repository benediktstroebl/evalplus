```python
def unique(lst: list) -> list:
    """
    Return sorted unique elements in a list.

    Args:
        lst (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: A sorted list with unique elements.

    Example:
        >>> unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
        [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
    """
    return sorted(set(lst))

# Test the function
print(unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]))
```

This script defines a function `unique` that takes a list as input, converts it to a set to remove duplicates, and then sorts the set. The sorted set is then returned as a list. The `set` data structure in Python does not preserve order, but since we're sorting the set before returning it, the order is preserved.
