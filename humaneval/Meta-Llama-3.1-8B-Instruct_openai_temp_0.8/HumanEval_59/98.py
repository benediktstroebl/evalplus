```python
def largest_prime_factor(n: int) -> int:

    Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime.

    Args:
    n (int): A composite number greater than 1.

    Returns:
    int: The largest prime factor of n.

    Example:
    >>> largest_prime_factor(13195)
    29
    >>> largest_prime_factor(2048)
    2

print(largest_prime_factor(13195))  # Output: 29
print(largest_prime_factor(2048))   # Output: 2

This script defines a function `largest_prime_factor` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns its largest prime factor. The function works by dividing the input number `n` by the smallest prime number `i` (initially set to 2) as long as it's divisible. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, it increments `i` by 1. This process continues until `n` is reduced to its largest prime factor.
