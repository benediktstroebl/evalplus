    Returns:
    int: The largest prime factor of n.

    Examples:

This script defines a function `largest_prime_factor` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns its largest prime factor. The function uses a loop to divide `n` by the smallest prime factor (2) as long as it's divisible. Then it increments the divisor until it finds the next number that can divide `n`, which will be a prime number. This process continues until `n` is reduced to its largest prime factor.
