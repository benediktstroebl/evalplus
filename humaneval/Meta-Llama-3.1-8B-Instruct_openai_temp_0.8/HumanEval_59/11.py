```python

    Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime.

    Args:
    n (int): A positive integer greater than 1.

    Returns:
    int: The largest prime factor of n.

    Example:
    >>> largest_prime_factor(13195)
    29
    >>> largest_prime_factor(2048)
    2

This script defines a function `largest_prime_factor` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns its largest prime factor. It iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive), checking for divisibility. If `n` is divisible by `i`, it divides `n` by `i` and continues with the next iteration. When `n` is no longer divisible by any number up to its square root, it returns `n` as the largest prime factor. The function is tested with two examples from the problem statement.
