```python
def largest_prime_factor(n: int) -> int:

    Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime.

    Args:
        n (int): A composite number greater than 1.

    Returns:
        int: The largest prime factor of n.

    Example:
        >>> largest_prime_factor(13195)

        >>> largest_prime_factor(2048)
        2

This script defines a function `largest_prime_factor` that takes an integer `n` and returns its largest prime factor. It uses a while loop to iterate through numbers from 2 to the square root of `n`, checking if `n` is divisible by the current number. If it is, `n` is divided by the current number. This process continues until `n` is no longer divisible by any number, at which point `n` itself is the largest prime factor.
