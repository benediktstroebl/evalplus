This script uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. The GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. The algorithm repeatedly replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, until `b` is zero. At this point, `a` is the GCD.
