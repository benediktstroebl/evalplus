```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Return the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b.

    The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers a and b is the largest positive integer that divides both a and b without leaving a remainder.

    Args:
        a (int): The first integer.
        b (int): The second integer.

    Returns:
        int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.

    Examples:
        >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
        1
        >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
        5
    """
    while b!= 0:
        # Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD
        a, b = b, a % b
    return abs(a)

# Test the function
print(greatest_common_divisor(3, 5))  # Output: 1
print(greatest_common_divisor(25, 15))  # Output: 5
```

This script uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b. The algorithm works by repeatedly replacing (a, b) with (b, a % b) until b is zero. At this point, a is the greatest common divisor. The `abs` function is used to handle cases where the input numbers are negative.
