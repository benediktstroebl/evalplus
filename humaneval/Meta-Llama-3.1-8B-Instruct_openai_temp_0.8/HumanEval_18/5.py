```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """
    Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string.
    Count overlapping cases.

    Args:
        string (str): The original string to search in.
        substring (str): The substring to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The number of times the substring can be found in the string.

    >>> how_many_times('', 'a')
    0
    >>> how_many_times('aaa', 'a')
    3
    >>> how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')
    3
    """
    count = 0
    start = 0
    while start < len(string):
        pos = string.find(substring, start)
        if pos!= -1:
            count += 1
            start = pos + 1
        else:
            break
    return count
```

This script uses a while loop to continuously search for the substring starting from the last known position (`start`). If the substring is found, it increments the count and updates the start position. If the substring is not found, the loop breaks and the function returns the count.
