```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """
    Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string. 
    Count overlapping cases.

    Args:
        string (str): The original string.
        substring (str): The substring to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The number of times the substring can be found in the original string.

    Examples:
        >>> how_many_times('', 'a')
        0
        >>> how_many_times('aaa', 'a')
        3
        >>> how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')
        3

    count = 0
    index = 0
    while index < len(string):
        index = string.find(substring, index)
        if index!= -1:
            count += 1
            index += 1  # To count overlapping cases, increment the index
        else:
            break
    return count

```

This script uses a while loop to repeatedly search for the substring in the string, starting from the current index. The `find()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring, or -1 if it's not found. If the substring is found, the index is incremented to count overlapping cases. The loop continues until the substring is no longer found, at which point the function returns the count.
