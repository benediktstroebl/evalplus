This script defines a function `how_many_times` that takes a string and a substring as input and returns the number of times the substring is found in the string, considering overlapping cases. It uses a while loop to repeatedly find the substring in the string, starting from the position where the previous occurrence was found. The test cases demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs.
