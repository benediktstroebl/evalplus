```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """
    Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string.
    Count overlapping cases.

    Args:
        string (str): The original string.
        substring (str): The substring to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The number of times the substring appears in the string.

    Examples:
        >>> how_many_times('', 'a')
        0
        >>> how_many_times('aaa', 'a')
        3
        >>> how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')
        3
    """
    count = 0
    start = 0

    while start < len(string):
        pos = string.find(substring, start)
        if pos!= -1:
            count += 1
            start = pos + 1
        else:
            break

    return count
```

This script uses a while loop to continuously search for the substring in the string, starting from the position where the previous match was found. If a match is found, the count is incremented and the start position is moved to the position right after the match. If no match is found, the loop breaks. This way, all overlapping cases are counted.
