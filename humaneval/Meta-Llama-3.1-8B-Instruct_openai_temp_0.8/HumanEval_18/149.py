    Returns:
        int: The number of times the substring appears in the string.

This script uses a `while` loop to keep finding the substring from the current position until it can't be found anymore. The `find` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring, or -1 if the substring is not found. We increment the `start` position by 1 each time we find the substring to avoid counting overlapping cases. If the substring is not found, we break out of the loop.
