Here is the Python script that meets the requirements:
```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)

# Test cases
import doctest
doctest.testmod()
```
This script defines a function `max_element` that takes a list as input and returns its maximum element using the built-in `max` function. The `doctest.testmod()` line is used to run the test cases provided in the docstring and assert that the function behaves as expected.
