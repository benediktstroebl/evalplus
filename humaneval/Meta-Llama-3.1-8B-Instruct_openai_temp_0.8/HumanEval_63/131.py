This script defines a function `fibfib(n)` to compute the n-th element of the FibFib number sequence. It handles the base cases where `n` is 0, 1, 2, or 3. For larger values of `n`, it initializes the first three numbers in the sequence as `a`, `b`, and `c`, and then iteratively computes the next numbers in the sequence using a loop. The function finally returns the n-th number in the sequence. The script also includes test cases to verify the correctness of the function.
