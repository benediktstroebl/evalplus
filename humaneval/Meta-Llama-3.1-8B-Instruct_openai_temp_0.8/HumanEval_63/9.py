    The FibFib number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence 
    that's defined as follows:
    fibfib(0) == 0
    fibfib(1) == 0
    fibfib(2) == 1
    fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3).

    Args:
    n (int): The position of the element in the sequence.

    Returns:
    int: The nth element of the FibFib sequence.

    Raises:
    ValueError: If n is less than 0.

    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a non-negative integer")

This script defines a function `fibfib(n)` that calculates the nth element of the FibFib sequence. The function uses a loop to iteratively calculate the elements of the sequence, and it handles edge cases where n is less than 0, 0, 1, or 2 separately. The script also includes test cases to verify the correctness of the function.
