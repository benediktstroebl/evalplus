### Efficient Fibonacci-like Sequence Computation
```python
def fibfib(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Compute the nth element of the FibFib number sequence.

    The FibFib number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence,
    defined by: fibfib(0) == 0, fibfib(1) == 0, fibfib(2) == 1, and
    fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3).

    This function uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the nth element.

    Args:
        n (int): The index of the element to compute in the FibFib sequence.

    Returns:
        int: The nth element of the FibFib sequence.

    if n <= 1:

        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        # Base case: fibfib(2) == 1
        return 1
    else:
        # Initialize a list to store computed elements
        fibfib_values = [0] * (n + 1)
        fibfib_values[0] = 0  # fibfib(0) == 0
        fibfib_values[1] = 0  # fibfib(1) == 0
        fibfib_values[2] = 1  # fibfib(2) == 1

        for i in range(3, n + 1):

        # Return the nth element
        return fibfib_values[n]


# Test the function
print(fibfib(1))  # Output: 0
print(fibfib(5))  # Output: 4
print(fibfib(8))  # Output: 24
```
This code defines a function `fibfib` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth element of the FibFib number sequence. It uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the elements of the sequence. The function is tested with several examples to demonstrate its correctness.
