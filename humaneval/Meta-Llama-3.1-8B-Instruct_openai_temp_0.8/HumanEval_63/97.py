This script uses matrix exponentiation to efficiently compute the nth element of the FibFib sequence. The base cases are handled explicitly, and the remaining elements are computed using a divide-and-conquer approach. The matrix exponentiation is implemented using a helper function that performs matrix multiplication. The result matrix is then used to compute the nth element of the FibFib sequence. The test cases at the end verify the correctness of the function.
