### Efficiently Computing the nth Element of the FibFib Number Sequence
### =====================================================================

In this solution, we'll use dynamic programming to store previously computed values and avoid redundant calculations. We'll also use a memoization technique to store the results of expensive function calls so they can be reused instead of recalculated.

```python
def fibfib(n: int):
    """
    Compute the nth element of the FibFib number sequence.

    The FibFib number sequence is a sequence defined as follows:
    fibfib(0) == 0
    fibfib(1) == 0
    fibfib(2) == 1
    fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3)

    Args:
        n (int): The index of the element to compute.

    Returns:
        int: The nth element of the FibFib number sequence.

    Example:
        >>> fibfib(1)
        0
        >>> fibfib(5)
        4
        >>> fibfib(8)
        24
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a non-negative integer")

    memo = {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 1}

    def fibfib_recursive(n: int):
        if n not in memo:
            memo[n] = fibfib_recursive(n-1) + fibfib_recursive(n-2) + fibfib_recursive(n-3)
        return memo[n]

    return fibfib_recursive(n)
```

However, the above recursive implementation is not the most efficient solution for large inputs, as it performs a lot of redundant calculations.

Here's an iterative solution that uses dynamic programming to store previously computed values:

```python
def fibfib(n: int):
    """
    Compute the nth element of the FibFib number sequence.

    The FibFib number sequence is a sequence defined as follows:
    fibfib(0) == 0
    fibfib(1) == 0
    fibfib(2) == 1
    fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3)

    Args:
        n (int): The index of the element to compute.

    Returns:
        int: The nth element of the FibFib number sequence.

    Example:
        >>> fibfib(1)
        0
        >>> fibfib(5)
        4
        >>> fibfib(8)
        24
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a non-negative integer")

    if n <= 2:
        return 0 if n == 1 else 1

    a, b, c = 0, 0, 1
    for _ in range(3, n + 1):
        a, b, c = b, c, b + c + a

    return c
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it much more efficient for large inputs.
