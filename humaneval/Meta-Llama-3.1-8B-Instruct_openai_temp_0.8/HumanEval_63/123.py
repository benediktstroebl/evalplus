```python

    """
    This function calculates the nth element of the FibFib number sequence.
    
    The FibFib number sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but defined as:
    fibfib(0) == 0
    fibfib(1) == 0
    fibfib(2) == 1
    fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3).
    
    Args:
    n (int): The position of the element in the FibFib sequence.
    
    Returns:
    int: The nth element of the FibFib sequence.
    
    Raises:
    ValueError: If n is a negative integer.

    # Base cases
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:

However, a more efficient way to solve this problem is to use a recursive function with memoization. This way we don't need to recalculate the same values multiple times.

```python
def fibfib(n: int) -> int:
    """
    This function calculates the nth element of the FibFib number sequence.
    
    Args:
    n (int): The position of the element in the FibFib sequence.
    
    Returns:
    int: The nth element of the FibFib sequence.
    
    Raises:
    ValueError: If n is a negative integer.
    """
    
    # Create a dictionary to store the previously calculated values
    memo = {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 1}
    
    def fibfib_recursive(k: int) -> int:
        # If the value is already calculated, return it
        if k in memo:
            return memo[k]
        # Otherwise, calculate the value and store it in the dictionary
        else:
            result = fibfib_recursive(k - 1) + fibfib_recursive(k - 2) + fibfib_recursive(k - 3)
            memo[k] = result
            return result
    
    # Call the recursive function to calculate the nth element
    return fibfib_recursive(n)


# Test cases
print(fibfib(1))  # Output: 0
print(fibfib(5))  # Output: 4
print(fibfib(8))  # Output: 24
```

This version of the function uses a recursive approach with memoization, which makes it more efficient than the previous version for large values of n. However, be aware that the recursive approach can still lead to a stack overflow for very large values of n due to Python's limit on recursion depth.
