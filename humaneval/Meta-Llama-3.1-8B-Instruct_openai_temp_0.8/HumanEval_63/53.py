    The FibFib number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece 
    that's defined as follows:

    fibfib(1) == 0
    fibfib(2) == 1
    fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3).

    Args:
        n (int): The position in the FibFib sequence to compute.

    Returns:
        int: The n-th element of the FibFib sequence.

This script defines the `fibfib` function to compute the n-th element of the FibFib sequence. It uses an iterative approach with a loop that computes each element in the sequence. The time complexity is O(n), making it efficient for large values of n. The script also includes test cases to verify the correctness of the function.
