This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the list. It sorts the list first to make it easier to find three distinct numbers that sum to zero. Then, it uses two pointers, one at the next element and one at the end of the list, to move towards each other and find three numbers that sum to zero. If such three numbers are found, it returns True. If no such three numbers are found after iterating over the list, it returns False.
