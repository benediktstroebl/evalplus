This solution uses a set (`seen`) to keep track of the numbers we have seen so far. We iterate over the list, and for each number, we calculate its complement to get to zero. We then iterate over the possible number of needed distinct numbers to add to the complement, and check if the complement is in the seen set. If it is, we return True. If we finish iterating over the list without finding three distinct numbers that sum to zero, we return False.
