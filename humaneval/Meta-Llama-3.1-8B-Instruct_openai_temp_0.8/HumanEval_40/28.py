    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        lst (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if three distinct elements sum to zero, False otherwise.

# Example usage:
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False

This script uses a set to efficiently keep track of seen numbers and a single pass through the list to find three distinct elements that sum to zero. The time complexity is O(n^2) due to the nested loops, where n is the length of the input list. The space complexity is O(n) for storing seen numbers in the set.
