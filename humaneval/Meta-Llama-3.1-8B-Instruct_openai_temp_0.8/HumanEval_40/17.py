### Triplets Sum to Zero Problem Solution

The following Python script solves the problem by utilizing a two-pointer technique to find three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.

```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst):
    """
    This function checks if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.

    Args:
    lst (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
    bool: True if three distinct elements sum to zero, False otherwise.
    """
    lst.sort()  # Sort the list to apply the two-pointer technique
    for i in range(len(lst) - 2):  # Iterate over the list
        left, right = i + 1, len(lst) - 1  # Initialize two pointers
        while left < right:  # Move the pointers until they meet
            total = lst[i] + lst[left] + lst[right]
            if total == 0:  # If the sum is zero, return True
                return True
            elif total < 0:  # If the sum is less than zero, move the left pointer
                left += 1
            else:  # If the sum is greater than zero, move the right pointer
                right -= 1
    return False  # If no triplet is found, return False


# Test cases
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```

This script sorts the input list and then uses a two-pointer technique to find three distinct elements that sum to zero. If such a triplet is found, the function returns True. If no triplet is found after iterating over the entire sorted list, the function returns False. The test cases demonstrate the function's correctness.
