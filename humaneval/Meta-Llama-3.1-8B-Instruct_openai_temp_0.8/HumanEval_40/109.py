This script uses a set to efficiently check if a number's complement (i.e., -num) has been seen before. If the complement is found in the set, it then checks if there's a third distinct number that sums to zero. If such a combination is found, it immediately returns `True`. If no such combination is found after iterating over the entire list, it returns `False`.
