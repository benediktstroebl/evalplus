### Triplets Sum to Zero

The following Python script checks if there are three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero.

```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list) -> bool:
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        l (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, False otherwise.
    """
    # Sort the list to make it easier to check for three distinct elements
    l.sort()
    # Iterate over the list
    for i in range(len(l) - 2):
        # Initialize two pointers, one at the next element and one at the end of the list
        left, right = i + 1, len(l) - 1
        # Continue the iteration if the current element is the same as the previous one to avoid duplicates
        if i > 0 and l[i] == l[i - 1]:
            continue
        # While the two pointers haven't crossed each other
        while left < right:
            # Calculate the current sum
            current_sum = l[i] + l[left] + l[right]
            # If the sum is zero, return True
            if current_sum == 0:
                return True
            # If the sum is less than zero, move the left pointer to the right because we need a larger sum
            elif current_sum < 0:
                left += 1
            # If the sum is greater than zero, move the right pointer to the left because we need a smaller sum
            else:
                right -= 1
    # If no three distinct elements sum to zero, return False
    return False


# Test cases
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```

This script works by iterating over the list with three pointers: `i` is the current index, and `left` and `right` are the indices of the elements that should sum to `l[i]`. If `l[left] + l[right] + l[i] == 0`, we return `True`. If `l[left] + l[right] + l[i] < 0`, we move `left` to the right because we need a larger sum. If `l[left] + l[right] + l[i] > 0`, we move `right` to the left because we need a smaller sum. This process is repeated for each element in the list, and if no three distinct elements sum to zero, we return `False`.
