### Triples Sum to Zero Solution
```python

    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.

This script solves the problem by iterating through the input list. For each element, it calculates its complement (the value that would make the sum equal to zero). If the complement is already in the `seen` set, it checks all other elements in the `seen` set to see if there is a triplet that sums to zero. If such a triplet is found, the function immediately returns True. If no such triplet is found after checking all elements, the function returns False. This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loop structure.
