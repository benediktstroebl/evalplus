This script works by iterating over the list of numbers. For each number, it checks if its complement (i.e., the number that would make the sum equal to zero) is in the set of numbers seen so far. If it is, it checks all pairs of numbers seen so far to see if they sum to the complement. If such a pair is found, it returns True. If it doesn't find such a pair after checking all pairs, it adds the current number to the set of numbers seen and continues with the next number. If it finishes checking all numbers without finding a triple that sums to zero, it returns False.
