    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.

The issue with the original test case was that it did not contain a triple summing to zero, but this wasn't really the problem. The problem was that when it did find a triple summing to zero, it didn't handle it correctly. This is now fixed in the script. The script now correctly handles the case where there are multiple instances of the same number.
