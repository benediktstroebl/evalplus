This script uses two sets: `seen` to store the numbers we've seen so far, and `sums` to store the sums of two numbers from the list. It iterates over the list, calculating the sum of the current number and every number we've seen before. If the sum is zero and we haven't seen it before, it returns True. If the sum is not zero and we haven't seen it before, it adds it to the set of sums. Finally, if we've iterated over the entire list and haven't found three numbers that sum to zero, it returns False.
