This script uses a set to keep track of the elements we've seen so far, as well as their complements. It iterates over the list, checking each element to see if its complement (the number that would make it sum to zero) has been seen before. If it has, the function immediately returns True. If the function finishes iterating over the list without finding a triplet, it returns False.
