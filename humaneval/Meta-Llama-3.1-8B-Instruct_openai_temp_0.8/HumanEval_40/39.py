This script works by iterating over the list and for each element, it checks if there are other elements in the list that would sum to zero with it. It uses a set to keep track of elements it has seen so far to ensure that it finds distinct elements. If it finds three distinct elements that sum to zero, it immediately returns True. If it iterates over the entire list without finding such elements, it returns False.
