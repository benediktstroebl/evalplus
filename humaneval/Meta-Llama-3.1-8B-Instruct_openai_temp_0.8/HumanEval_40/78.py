This script uses a set to keep track of the numbers we've seen so far. It iterates over the list, for each number it checks if the complement (-num) has been seen before. If the complement has been seen, it checks if there's a third number that, when added to the complement, sums to zero. If it finds such a set of three numbers, it returns True. If it iterates over the entire list and finds nothing, it returns False.
