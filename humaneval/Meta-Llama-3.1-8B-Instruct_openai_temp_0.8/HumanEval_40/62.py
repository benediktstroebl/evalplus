### Solution
```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        l (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, False otherwise.

        for prev_num in seen:

                return True  # If we find three numbers that sum to zero, return True
        seen.add(num)  # Add the current number to the set of seen numbers
    return False  # If we've iterated through the entire list and haven't found three numbers that sum to zero, return False

### Explanation
This script defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as input and returns `True` if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise.

The function uses a `set` called `seen` to keep track of seen numbers. It iterates through the input list, and for each number, it finds the number that would sum to zero with the current number (the complement). It then checks if the sum of the current number and a previous number equals the complement. If it finds three numbers that sum to zero, it returns `True`. If it iterates through the entire list without finding three numbers that sum to zero, it returns `False`.
