### Triples Sum to Zero
#### Problem Description

This script checks if there are three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero.

#### Solution
```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst: list) -> bool:
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
    False
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
    True
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
    False
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])
    True
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1])
    False
    """
    # Check if the list length is less than 3, return False
    if len(lst) < 3:
        return False

    # Sort the list in ascending order
    lst.sort()

    # Initialize three pointers
    left, right = 1, len(lst) - 1

    while left < right:
        # Calculate the sum of the three elements
        total = lst[left] + lst[right] + lst[0]

        # If the sum is zero, return True
        if total == 0:
            return True
        # If the sum is less than zero, move the left pointer to the right
        elif total < 0:
            left += 1
        # If the sum is greater than zero, move the right pointer to the left
        else:
            right -= 1

    # If no such triple is found, return False
    return False

# Test cases
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```

#### Explanation

This script uses the two-pointer technique to find a triple that sums to zero. The list is first sorted in ascending order. Then, two pointers, `left` and `right`, are initialized to the second and last elements of the list, respectively. The script then enters a loop, where it checks the sum of the elements at the `left`, `right`, and the first element of the list. If the sum is zero, the script returns `True`. If the sum is less than zero, the `left` pointer is moved to the right to increase the sum. If the sum is greater than zero, the `right` pointer is moved to the left to decrease the sum. If no such triple is found after the loop, the script returns `False`.
