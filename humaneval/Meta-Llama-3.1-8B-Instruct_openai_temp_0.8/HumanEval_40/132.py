This Python script uses a set to store unique elements from the input list. It iterates over the list and for each number, it creates a complement set with unique elements. If the size of the complement set is 2 and its elements, including the negative value of the current number, are distinct from each other and the current number, it returns True. If no such triple is found after iterating over the entire list, it returns False.
