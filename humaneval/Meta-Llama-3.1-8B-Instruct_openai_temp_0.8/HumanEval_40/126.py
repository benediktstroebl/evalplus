    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.

    Returns:
        bool: Whether there are three distinct elements that sum to zero.

This script uses a list comprehension to generate all possible triplets from the input list, then checks each triplet to see if its sum is zero. If it finds a triplet that sums to zero, it immediately returns True. If it checks all triplets without finding one that sums to zero, it returns False.

Note that this script has a time complexity of O(n^3) due to the list comprehension and the nested loops inside it. This is not the most efficient solution for large lists, but it is simple and easy to understand.
