This script defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that checks whether there are three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero. The function uses sets to efficiently store the numbers it has seen so far and the numbers that sum to zero. It iterates over the list, calculating the differences between each number and the numbers it has seen so far, and checks whether these differences are also in the list. If three distinct elements that sum to zero are found, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The script also includes some test cases to verify the correctness of the function.
