This script works by iterating over the list and for each number, it checks if its complement (i.e. the number that would make the triple sum to zero) is in the set of numbers we've seen so far. If it is, it means we've found a triple that sums to zero, so we return True. If we've iterated over the entire list and haven't found a triple that sums to zero, we return False.
