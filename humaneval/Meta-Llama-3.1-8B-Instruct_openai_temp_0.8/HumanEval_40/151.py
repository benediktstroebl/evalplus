Here is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem in a markdown code block:

```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        l (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if three distinct elements sum to zero, False otherwise.

    Examples:
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
        False
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
        True
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
        False
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])
        True
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1])
        False
    """
    # Sort the list to make it easier to find triplets
    l.sort()

    # Iterate over the list
    for i in range(len(l) - 2):
        # Initialize two pointers, one at the start of the remaining list
        # and one at the end
        left, right = i + 1, len(l) - 1

        # Continue searching for triplets while the two pointers haven't crossed each other
        while left < right:
            # Calculate the sum of the three elements
            total = l[i] + l[left] + l[right]

            # If the sum is zero, we found a triplet, return True
            if total == 0:
                return True
            # If the sum is less than zero, move the left pointer to the right
            elif total < 0:
                left += 1
            # If the sum is greater than zero, move the right pointer to the left
            else:
                right -= 1

    # If we've iterated over the entire list and haven't found a triplet, return False
    return False

# Test the function
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```

This script uses a two-pointer technique to find triplets in the list. It first sorts the list, and then iterates over the list with three pointers: one fixed pointer `i` and two moving pointers `left` and `right`. The `left` pointer starts at the next element of `i` and the `right` pointer starts at the end of the list. The pointers move towards each other, and the sum of the elements at the three pointers is calculated. If the sum is zero, a triplet is found and the function returns True. If the sum is less than zero, the `left` pointer is moved to the right to increase the sum. If the sum is greater than zero, the `right` pointer is moved to the left to decrease the sum. If the pointers cross each other, the function returns False because no triplet is found.
