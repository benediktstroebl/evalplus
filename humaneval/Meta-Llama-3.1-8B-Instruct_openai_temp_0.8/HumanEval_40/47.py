**Triplets Sum to Zero**
========================

This Python script checks if there are three distinct elements in a given list that sum to zero.

```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst: list) -> bool:
    """
    This function checks if there are three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero.

    Args:
    lst (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
    bool: True if there are three distinct elements that sum to zero, False otherwise.
    """
    # Create a set to store the elements we've seen so far
    seen = set()

    # Create a set to store the sums of two elements we've seen so far
    sums = set()

    # Iterate over the list
    for num in lst:
        # For each element, calculate the sum of it with all elements we've seen so far
        for prev_num in seen:
            # Calculate the sum of the current element and the previous element
            total = num + prev_num

            # Check if the sum is zero and we haven't seen this sum before
            if total == 0 and total not in sums:
                # If we find a triplet that sums to zero, return True
                return True

            # Add the sum to the set of sums
            sums.add(total)

        # Add the current element to the set of seen elements
        seen.add(num)

    # If we've iterated over the entire list and haven't found a triplet that sums to zero, return False
    return False


# Example use cases:
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```

This script uses a two-set approach to solve the problem efficiently. The `seen` set stores the elements we've seen so far, and the `sums` set stores the sums of two elements we've seen so far. We iterate over the list and for each element, we calculate the sum of it with all elements we've seen so far. If we find a sum that is zero and hasn't been seen before, we return True. If we've iterated over the entire list and haven't found a triplet that sums to zero, we return False.
