    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.

This script defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as input and returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and False otherwise. The function uses a set `seen` to keep track of the numbers it has seen so far, and for each number in the input list, it checks if its complement (the number that would make the sum zero) is in the `seen` set. If it is, it then checks if there are two other distinct numbers in the list that add up to the complement. If such three numbers are found, the function returns True; otherwise, it continues to the next number. If no such three numbers are found after checking all numbers, the function returns False.
