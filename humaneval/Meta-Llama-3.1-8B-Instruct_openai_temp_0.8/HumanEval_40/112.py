### Triples Sum to Zero
#### Problem Description
The function `triples_sum_to_zero` checks if there are three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero.

#### Solution
```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        l (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if three distinct elements sum to zero, False otherwise.
    """
    # Create a set to store the elements we have seen so far
    seen = set()
    
    # Create a set to store the elements that are the complement of the seen elements
    complement = set()
    
    # Iterate over the list
    for num in l:
        # For each number, calculate its complement
        complement_num = -num
        
        # If the complement is in the seen set, it means we have found three distinct elements that sum to zero
        if complement_num in seen:
            return True
        
        # Add the current number to the seen set
        seen.add(num)
        
        # Add the complement to the complement set
        complement.add(complement_num)
    
    # If we have iterated over the entire list and not found three distinct elements that sum to zero, return False
    return False
```

#### Example Use Cases
```python
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```
