This script uses a set to keep track of the numbers that have been seen so far. For each number, it checks if its complement (i.e., the number that would sum to zero if added to the current number) is in the set. If it is, it then checks each number in the set to see if it, the current number, and the complement sum to zero. If they do and all three numbers are distinct, the function returns True. If no such triple is found after checking all numbers, the function returns False.
