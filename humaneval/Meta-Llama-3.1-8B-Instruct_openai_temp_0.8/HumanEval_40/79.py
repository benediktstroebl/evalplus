    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if three distinct elements sum to zero, False otherwise.

    Examples:
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
        False
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
        True

        False
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])
        True
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1])

The provided code function `triples_sum_to_zero` works by iterating over the list of numbers. For each number, it creates a set of pairs with it that we've seen before and checks if their sum is zero. If it finds such a pair, it immediately returns True. Otherwise, it adds the number to the set of pairs with it and the set of seen numbers. If it iterates over all numbers without finding three that sum to zero, it returns False.
