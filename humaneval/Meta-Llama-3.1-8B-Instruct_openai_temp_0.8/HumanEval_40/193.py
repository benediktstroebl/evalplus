This script uses a set to store the numbers we've seen so far and another set to store the sums of two numbers we've seen so far. It iterates over the list of numbers, checking if the negative of the current number is in the two_sum set (which would indicate that we've found three numbers that sum to zero). If it has, it returns True. If it hasn't, it continues adding the current number to the seen set and the sum of the current number and all previous numbers to the two_sum set. If it iterates over the entire list without finding three numbers that sum to zero, it returns False.
