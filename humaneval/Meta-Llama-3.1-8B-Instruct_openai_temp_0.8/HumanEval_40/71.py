    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.

This script uses a set to keep track of the numbers it has seen, and checks for the existence of a triple by iterating over the seen set for each number. If it finds a pair of numbers that sum to the negation of the current number, it returns True. If it checks all numbers and doesn't find a triple, it returns False. The test cases are included at the end to verify the function's correctness.
