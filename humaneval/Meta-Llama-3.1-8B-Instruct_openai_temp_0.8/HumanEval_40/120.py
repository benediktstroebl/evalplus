This script defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as input and returns `True` if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a set to keep track of the numbers it has seen so far and a set to store the complements of the current number. If it finds three distinct complements, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The script also includes some test cases to verify the correctness of the function.
