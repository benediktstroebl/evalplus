This code works by iterating over the list of numbers and for each number, it checks if its complement (the number that would add up to zero) has been seen before. If it has, then we've found three numbers that sum to zero. If not, we add the current number to the set of seen numbers and continue iterating. If we've iterated over the entire list and haven't found three numbers that sum to zero, we return False.
