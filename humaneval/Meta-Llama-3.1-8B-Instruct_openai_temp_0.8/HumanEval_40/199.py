This script uses a set to keep track of the numbers we've seen so far, and another set to keep track of the triplets we've found. It goes through the list, for each number, it checks if its complement (i.e., the number that would sum to zero when added to it) is in the set of seen numbers. If it is, it adds the triplet (the current number, its complement, and 0) to the set of triplets. Finally, it returns True if there are any triplets in the set of triplets, and False otherwise.
