This script defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers and returns `True` if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero and `False` otherwise. It uses a two-pointer technique and sorts the list in ascending order to improve efficiency. The script also includes test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
