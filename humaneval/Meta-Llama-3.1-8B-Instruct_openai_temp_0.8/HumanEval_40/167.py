This script uses three nested loops to iterate over all possible combinations of three elements from the list. It checks if the sum of these elements is zero and if they are distinct. If it finds such a combination, it immediately returns `True`. If it checks all possible combinations without finding such a combination, it returns `False`. 

Please note that this script has a time complexity of O(n^3), which may not be efficient for large lists. A more efficient solution would involve using a hash set or dictionary to keep track of the elements we've seen so far, which would reduce the time complexity to O(n^2). 

Here's an optimized version of the script with a time complexity of O(n^2):
