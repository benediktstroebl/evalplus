This script uses a set to store seen numbers to avoid duplicates and ensure that the three numbers are distinct. It iterates over the list, calculates the complement for each number, and checks if the third number is in the list. If it finds three numbers that sum to zero, it returns True. If it doesn't find three numbers, it returns False.
