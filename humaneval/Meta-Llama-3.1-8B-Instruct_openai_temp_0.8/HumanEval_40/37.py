### Triples Sum to Zero Function
```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(numbers: list) -> bool:
    """
    This function checks if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.

    Args:
    numbers (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
    bool: True if there are three distinct elements that sum to zero, False otherwise.

    Examples:
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
    False
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
    True
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
    False
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])
    True
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1])
    False

You can use this function like this:
```python
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # Output: False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # Output: True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # Output: False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))  # Output: True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))  # Output: False
```
