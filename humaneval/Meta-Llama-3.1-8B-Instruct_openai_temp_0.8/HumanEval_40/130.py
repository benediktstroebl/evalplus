```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        l (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: Whether there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.

    Examples:
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
        False
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
        True
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
        False
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])
        True
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1])

This script uses a pair of sets to keep track of the numbers we have seen and the sums of pairs we have seen. For each number, we calculate the sum of all pairs with the current number and check if we have seen a pair sum that is the negation of the current number. If we have, we return True because we have found three distinct elements that sum to zero. If we do not return by the end of the function, it means we have not found three distinct elements that sum to zero, so we return False.
