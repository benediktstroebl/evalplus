This script defines the function `triples_sum_to_zero` to check if there are three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero. It iterates over each number in the list, checks for its complement (the number that would sum to zero with it), and then checks if the remaining number is in the list. If it finds three numbers that sum to zero, it returns `True`. If it exhausts all numbers without finding three that sum to zero, it returns `False`. The script also includes test cases to verify the function's correctness.
