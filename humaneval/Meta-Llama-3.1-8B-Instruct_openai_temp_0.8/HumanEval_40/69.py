This script works by iterating over the list, maintaining two sets: `seen` stores the numbers we've seen so far, and `sums` stores the sums of pairs we've seen so far. For each number, we check if we can find a number that, when added to the current number, gives zero. If we find such a number, we return True, indicating that we've found a triple that sums to zero. If we've tried all numbers and haven't found a triple, we return False.
