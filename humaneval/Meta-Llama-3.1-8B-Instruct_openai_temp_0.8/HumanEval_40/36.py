### Solution

```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        l (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if three distinct elements sum to zero, False otherwise.

### Explanation

This solution uses two sets to keep track of the numbers we've seen so far and the combinations of two numbers that sum to the negation of a number we've seen. It iterates over the list of numbers, checking if the negation of the current number is in the `two_sum` set. If it is, it returns True. If not, it adds the current number to the `seen` set and adds the combinations of the current number and each number we've seen so far to the `two_sum` set. If it iterates over the entire list and doesn't find three numbers that sum to zero, it returns False.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the length of the list. This is because in the worst case, we need to iterate over the list n^2 times to check all combinations of two numbers.
