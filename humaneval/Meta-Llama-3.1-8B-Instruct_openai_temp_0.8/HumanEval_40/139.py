### Example Use Cases

```python
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # Output: False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # Output: True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # Output: False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))  # Output: True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))  # Output: False
