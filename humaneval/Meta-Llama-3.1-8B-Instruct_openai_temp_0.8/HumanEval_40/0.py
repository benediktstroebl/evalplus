This script uses two sets to keep track of the elements we've seen and the pairs of elements we've paired up. It iterates through the list, for each element, it calculates its complement (-num) and checks if we've seen the complement before. If we have, we check if we've paired up these two numbers before. If we have, we return True. If we haven't, we add the two numbers to the pairs set. We also add the current number to the seen set. If we've iterated through the entire list and haven't found three distinct numbers that sum to zero, we return False.
