This script defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as input and returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and False otherwise. The function uses a dictionary to store the elements it has seen so far and their complements, allowing it to keep track of the three elements that sum to zero. The script includes test cases to demonstrate the function's correctness.
