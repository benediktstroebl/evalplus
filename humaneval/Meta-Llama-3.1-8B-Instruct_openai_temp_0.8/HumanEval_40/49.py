    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.

This script uses a set to store the numbers we have seen so far and another dictionary to store the frequency of each number we have seen along with its complement. If we find a number and its complement in the dictionary, and also find a number that is equal to its complement plus another number that we have seen, then we return True. Otherwise, we return False.
