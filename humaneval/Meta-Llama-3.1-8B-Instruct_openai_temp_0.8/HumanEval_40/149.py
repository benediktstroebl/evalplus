### Solution
```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(nums):
    """
    Returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, False otherwise.
    
    Args:
    nums (list): A list of integers.
    
    Returns:
    bool: Whether three distinct elements in the list sum to zero.
    """
    seen = set()  # Stores the elements we have seen so far and their complements
    for num in nums:
        complement = -num  # The complement is the number that, when added to the current number, gives zero
        if num in seen:  # If we have seen the current number before, we have found three numbers that sum to zero
            return True
        if complement in seen:  # If we have seen the complement before, we have found three numbers that sum to zero
            return True
        seen.add(num)  # Add the current number to the set of seen numbers

    return False  # If we have iterated over all numbers and haven't found three that sum to zero, return False

# Example use cases
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```

This solution works by iterating over the input list and for each element, checking if its complement (the number that would give zero when added to it) has been seen before. If it has, then we have found three elements that sum to zero, and we immediately return True. If we finish iterating over the list without finding such a triple, then we return False.
