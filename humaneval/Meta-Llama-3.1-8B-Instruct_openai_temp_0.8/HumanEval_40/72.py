This script defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as input and returns `True` if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a dictionary to store the elements we have seen and their complements, and iterates over the list of numbers to find three distinct numbers that sum to zero. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs.
