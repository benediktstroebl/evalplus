This script defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as an input and returns `True` if there are three distinct elements that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise. It uses a set to store the elements it's seen so far, and iterates over the list twice to find pairs of numbers that sum to the negative of the current number. If it finds a pair, it adds the current number to the set and returns `True`. If it iterates over the entire list and doesn't find a pair, it returns `False`.
