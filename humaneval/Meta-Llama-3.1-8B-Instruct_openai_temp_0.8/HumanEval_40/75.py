### Triples Sum to Zero
#### Problem Description
This script checks if there are three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero.

#### Solution

```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst: list) -> bool:
    """
    This function checks if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.
    
    Args:
    lst (list): A list of integers.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, False otherwise.
    """
    
    # Check if the list has at least three elements
    if len(lst) < 3:
        return False
    
    # Sort the list in ascending order
    lst.sort()
    
    # Iterate over the list
    for i in range(len(lst) - 2):
        
        # Initialize two pointers, one at the next element and one at the end of the list
        left = i + 1
        right = len(lst) - 1

            else:
                right -= 1

    return False

# Example usage
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # Output: False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # Output: True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # Output: False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))  # Output: True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))  # Output: False

This script uses a two-pointer technique to find three elements that sum to zero. It sorts the list first to make it easier to find the three elements. It then iterates over the list, and for each element, it uses two pointers to find a pair of elements that sum to the negation of the current element. If it finds such a pair, it returns True. If it doesn't find any three elements that sum to zero, it returns False.
