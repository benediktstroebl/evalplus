### Solution: Triples Sum to Zero
#### Problem: Check if Three Distinct Elements Sum to Zero

Here is the Python solution using a set to store unique elements and a three-pointer technique to find a combination summing to zero:

```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(nums):
    """
    Check if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.

    Args:
    nums (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
    bool: True if three distinct elements sum to zero, False otherwise.
    """
    if len(nums) < 3:
        return False  # Less than three elements, not possible to find a triplet

    num_set = set(nums)
    for num in num_set:
        complement_set = set(nums) - {num}
        for complement in complement_set:
            target = -num - complement
            if target in complement_set:
                return True  # Found a triplet that sums to zero

    return False  # No triplet found that sums to zero

# Example use cases
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```

This script defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as input and returns `True` if three distinct elements sum to zero, and `False` otherwise. It uses a set to store unique elements and a three-pointer technique to find a combination summing to zero. The script also includes example use cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
