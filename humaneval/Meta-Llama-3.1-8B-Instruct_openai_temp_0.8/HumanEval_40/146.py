    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
    nums (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
    bool: True if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, False otherwise.

    Example:
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
    False
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
    True

    False
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])
    True

In this script, we first check if the length of the input list is less than 3. If it is, we return False because we cannot find three distinct elements that sum to zero.

Then we create a set to store the elements we've seen so far. For each element in the input list, we calculate its complement (which is the number that, when added to the current element, would sum to zero). If the complement is in the set, we return True, because we've found three distinct elements that sum to zero.

Finally, we return False if we've checked all the elements and haven't found three distinct elements that sum to zero.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list, because we're doing a constant amount of work for each element.
