### Triples Sum to Zero Function

This Python script defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that checks if there are three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero.
#### Code

```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(nums: list):
    """
    Checks if there are three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero.

    Args:
    nums (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
    bool: True if three distinct elements sum to zero, False otherwise.
    """
    # Create a set to store unique numbers
    num_set = set()
    
    # Create a set to store pairs of numbers that sum to the negation of the current number
    pair_set = set()
    
    # Iterate over the list of numbers
    for num in nums:
        # Calculate the negation of the current number
        neg_num = -num
        
        # If the negation of the current number is in the pair set, return True
        if neg_num in pair_set:
            return True
        
        # Add the pair of the current number and its negation to the pair set
        pair_set.add((num, neg_num))
        
        # Add the current number to the number set
        num_set.add(num)
    
    # If no three distinct elements sum to zero, return False
    return False

### Test Cases

# Test case 1: Four numbers that do not sum to zero
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # Expected output: False

# Test case 2: Three numbers that sum to zero
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # Expected output: True

# Test case 3: No numbers that sum to zero
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # Expected output: False

# Test case 4: Multiple numbers that sum to zero
print(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))  # Expected output: True

# Test case 5: Single number
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))  # Expected output: False
```

This script defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that uses two sets to efficiently check if there are three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero. It iterates over the list, calculating the negation of each number and checking if the negation is already in the pair set. If the negation is found, it means that three distinct elements sum to zero, and the function returns True. If no such elements are found, the function returns False. The script includes test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
