### Solution to triples_sum_to_zero problem
```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    :param l: A list of integers
    :return: True if there are three distinct elements that sum to zero, False otherwise
    """
    num_set = set()  # store unique elements in the list for efficient lookups
    for num in l:
        complement_set = set()  # store numbers that sum to -num
        for other_num in num_set:
            complement = -num - other_num
            if complement in l and complement!= num and complement!= other_num:
                return True
        num_set.add(num)  # add current number to the set
    return False

# Test cases
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```
In this script, we use a set to store unique elements from the input list. We then iterate through each element in the list, and for each element, we iterate through the set of unique elements. For each pair of elements, we calculate their complement (i.e., -sum of the two elements) and check if it is in the list. If we find a triple that sums to zero, we immediately return True. If we finish iterating through the list without finding such a triple, we return False.
