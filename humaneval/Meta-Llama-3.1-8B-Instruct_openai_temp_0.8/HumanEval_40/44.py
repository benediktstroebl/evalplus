This script defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that checks if there are three distinct elements in the input list that sum to zero. It uses a set data structure to efficiently look up numbers in the list and a nested loop to generate all pairs of numbers. If it finds a pair and its complement that sum to zero, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The script includes the provided test cases to demonstrate the function's correctness.
