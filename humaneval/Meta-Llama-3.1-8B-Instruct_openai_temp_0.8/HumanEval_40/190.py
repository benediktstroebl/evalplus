This script defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that checks if there are three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero. It uses a brute-force approach with a time complexity of O(n^3), but since the problem constraints are not mentioned, I have used a simple approach for clarity. However, for large lists, it would be more efficient to use a two-pointer technique with a time complexity of O(n^2) as used in the provided code. 

Note: The provided docstring and test cases are also included in the script to ensure the function behaves as expected.
