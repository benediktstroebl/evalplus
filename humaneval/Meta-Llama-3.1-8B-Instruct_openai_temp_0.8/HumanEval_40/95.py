This script solves the problem by iterating through the list and for each number, it checks if the negative of that number is in the set of seen numbers.  If it is, then it checks with each of the seen numbers if the three numbers sum up to zero.  If it finds such a combination, it immediately returns True.  If it iterates through the entire list without finding such a combination, it returns False.
