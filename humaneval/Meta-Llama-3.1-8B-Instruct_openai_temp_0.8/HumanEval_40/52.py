This script uses a two-pointer technique to find three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero. The list is first sorted, and then the script iterates over the list to find three elements that sum to zero. If such elements are found, the script returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The script also handles duplicate elements by skipping them in the iteration.
