This script uses a two-pointer technique to find a triple with sum zero. It first sorts the list in ascending order, then iterates over the list and uses two pointers to check all possible triplets. The pointers move based on the sum of the three elements. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the list.
