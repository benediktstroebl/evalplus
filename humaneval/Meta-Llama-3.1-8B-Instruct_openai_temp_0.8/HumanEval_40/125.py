This code works by iterating over the list and for each number, it calculates the complements (i.e., the numbers that would sum with the current number to zero). It keeps track of the complements we've found so far in a set, and checks if we've seen the complement before. If we have, it means we've found three numbers that sum to zero, so it returns True. If we haven't iterated over the entire list and haven't returned True, it means we haven't found three numbers that sum to zero, so it returns False.
