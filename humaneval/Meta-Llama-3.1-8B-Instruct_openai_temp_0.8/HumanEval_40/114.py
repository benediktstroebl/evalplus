### Triples Sum to Zero
#### Problem Description
The provided function `triples_sum_to_zero` takes a list of integers as an input and returns `True` if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise.

#### Solution
```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(nums: list):
    """
    Check if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.

    Args:
        nums (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if there are three distinct elements that sum to zero, False otherwise.

    Example:
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
        False
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
        True
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
        False
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])
        True
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1])
        False
    """
    if len(nums) < 3:
        return False  # If the list has less than three elements, it's impossible to find three elements summing to zero

    seen = set()  # Initialize a set to keep track of elements we've seen so far
    for num in nums:
        complement = -num  # Calculate the complement needed to sum to zero
        needed = nums[:]
        needed.remove(num)  # Remove the current number from the list of needed numbers
        needed = [n for n in needed if n!= complement]  # Remove the complement from the list of needed numbers

        # Check if the complement is in the list and we haven't seen it before
        if complement in needed and complement not in seen:
            return True  # If we found a triplet, return True

        seen.add(num)  # Add the current number to the set of seen numbers

    return False  # If we've checked all numbers and haven't found a triplet, return False
```

#### Example Use Cases
```python
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # Output: False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # Output: True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # Output: False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))  # Output: True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))  # Output: False
```
