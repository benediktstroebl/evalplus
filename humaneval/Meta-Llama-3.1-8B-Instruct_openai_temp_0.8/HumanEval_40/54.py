    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.

    Returns:
        bool: Whether there are three distinct elements that sum to zero.

This code runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of elements in the input list. This is because each element is processed once. The space complexity is also O(n), which is the maximum size of the sets we use to store the numbers we have seen and the numbers that can make a pair to reach zero.
