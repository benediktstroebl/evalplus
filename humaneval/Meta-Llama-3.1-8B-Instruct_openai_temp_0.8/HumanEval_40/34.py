    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.

This script uses a set to keep track of the numbers we've seen so far. For each number in the list, it calculates its complement and checks if we've seen a number whose complement with the current number equals the first number. If it finds such numbers, it immediately returns True. If it checks all numbers without finding such a combination, it returns False.
