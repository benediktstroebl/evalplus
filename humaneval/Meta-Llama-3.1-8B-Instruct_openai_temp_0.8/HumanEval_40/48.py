This script works by keeping track of the numbers we've seen so far in a set called `seen`. It also keeps track of the numbers that sum to zero in a set called `sum_to_zero`. For each number in the list, it checks if there's any pair of numbers in the `seen` set that sums to the current number. If there is, it adds the current number to the `sum_to_zero` set. If there isn't, it adds the current number to the `seen` set. At the end, it returns True if there's more than one number in the `sum_to_zero` set, and False otherwise.
