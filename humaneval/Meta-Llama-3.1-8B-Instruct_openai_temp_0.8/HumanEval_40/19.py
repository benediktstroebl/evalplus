This script uses a two-set approach to solve the problem efficiently. The `seen` set keeps track of the numbers we have seen so far, and the `pairs` set keeps track of the pairs of numbers we have seen so far. We iterate over the list, and for each number, we check if its negation or the negation of the number and the current number is in the `seen` set or if the number is in the `pairs` set. If we find a pair that sums up to zero, we immediately return True. If we don't find any triple sum to zero, we return False.
