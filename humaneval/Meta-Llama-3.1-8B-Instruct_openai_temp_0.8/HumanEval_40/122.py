This script uses a set to keep track of the elements we've seen so far and another set to store the elements that sum to zero. For each element in the list, it calculates the complement and checks if it's in the seen set. If it is, it means we've found three elements that sum to zero. If we've seen a total of at least one such triple, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
