This script defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as an input and returns `True` if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise. It uses a set to store the numbers it has seen so far and a dictionary to store the complements of these numbers. The function iterates over the list, checking if it has seen a number that complements the current number. If it has, it returns `True`. If it hasn't, it adds the current number to the set and the dictionary, and continues iterating. If it iterates over the entire list without finding three distinct numbers that sum to zero, it returns `False`. The script also includes test cases to verify that the function works correctly.
