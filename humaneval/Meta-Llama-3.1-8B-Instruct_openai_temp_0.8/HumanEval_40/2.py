    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.

In this script, we create a set `seen` to keep track of the numbers we have seen so far. For each number in the list, we check if its complement (-num) exists in the list and is different from the current number and its negative counterpart. If such a triplet is found, we immediately return True. If no such triplet is found after checking all numbers, we return False.
