This script uses a three-pointer technique to find three elements that sum to zero. The list is first sorted and duplicates are removed to improve search efficiency. Then, for each element in the list, two pointers are initialized to move closer until they find three elements that sum to zero. If such elements are found, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
