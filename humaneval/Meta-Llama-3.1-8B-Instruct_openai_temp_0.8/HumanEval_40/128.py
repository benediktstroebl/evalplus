    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Examples:
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
        False
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
        True
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
        False
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])
        True
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1])
        False

This script uses a set to store the elements we've seen so far, and another set to store the sums of pairs of elements. It iterates over the list of numbers, for each number, it iterates over the elements we've seen so far, calculates the sum of the current number and the seen number, and checks if the pair sum is the negation of a sum we've seen before. If it is, it returns True. It also adds the pair sum to the set of sums and adds the current number to the set of seen numbers. If it iterates over all numbers and hasn't found three numbers that sum to zero, it returns False.
