# Three Sum Problem

## Problem Description

This script solves the Three Sum problem. It takes a list of integers as input and returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and False otherwise.

## Solution

```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(numbers: list) -> bool:
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if three distinct elements sum to zero, False otherwise.
    """
    # Sort the list to prepare for two-pointer technique
    numbers.sort()

    # Iterate over the list
    for i, num1 in enumerate(numbers):
        # Initialize two pointers
        left, right = i + 1, len(numbers) - 1

        # Move the pointers based on the sum
        while left < right:
            total = num1 + numbers[left] + numbers[right]

            # If the sum is zero, return True
            if total == 0:
                return True
            # If the sum is less than zero, move the left pointer
            elif total < 0:
                left += 1
            # If the sum is greater than zero, move the right pointer
            else:
                right -= 1

    # If no triple sum to zero, return False
    return False
```

## Example Usage

```python
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list. This is because we use two pointers to slide over the list, which takes O(n) time, and we do this for each element in the list, resulting in a quadratic time complexity.
