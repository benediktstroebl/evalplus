**Triples Sum to Zero**
==========================

This script checks if there are three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero.

```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        l (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, False otherwise.

    Example:
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
        False
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
        True
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
        False
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])
        True
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1])
        False

# Test the function
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```

This script works by iterating over the list and for each number, it checks if there are two other numbers in the list that sum to the negative of the current number. If it finds such a pair, it returns True. If it iterates over the entire list without finding a triple that sums to zero, it returns False. This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) where n is the length of the list.
