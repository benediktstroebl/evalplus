### Triples Sum to Zero
#### Problem Description
Given a list of integers, determine if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.

#### Code
```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
    l (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
    bool: True if three distinct elements sum to zero, False otherwise.
    """
    seen = set()  # A set to store numbers we've seen so far
    for num in l:
        complement = -num  # The number we need to reach a sum of zero
        remaining = len(l) - 1  # The number of elements left to check
        for j in range(remaining):
            if (complement == num and j!= l.index(num)) or (complement in seen and j!= l.index(complement)):
                return True
            seen.add(num)  # Add the current number to the set
    return False  # If we've checked all numbers and found no triplets


# Test cases
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```

#### Explanation
The script uses a set `seen` to keep track of the numbers we've seen so far. It iterates over the list `l` and for each number, it calculates its complement (`-num`) that would be needed to reach a sum of zero. It then checks the remaining numbers in the list to see if any of them are the complement or if any of the other numbers we've seen so far are the complement. If it finds a pair that sums to zero, it returns True. If it checks all numbers and finds no triplets, it returns False.
