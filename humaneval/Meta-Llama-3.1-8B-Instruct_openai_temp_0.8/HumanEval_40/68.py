```python

    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        l (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if three distinct elements sum to zero, False otherwise.

### Example Use Cases:

```python
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```

This script uses a set `seen` to keep track of the numbers we have seen so far. For each number `num` in the list, we calculate its complement `-num`. If the complement is in the `seen` set, it means we have found three distinct numbers that sum to zero. However, we need to ensure that the three numbers are distinct, so we check if `-complement` is in the list and if `num` is not equal to `-complement`. If these conditions are met, we return `True`. Otherwise, we continue to the next number. If we have checked all numbers in the list and haven't found three distinct numbers that sum to zero, we return `False`.
