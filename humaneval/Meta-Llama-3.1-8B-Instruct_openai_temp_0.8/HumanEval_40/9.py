This script uses a two-pointer technique to find three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero. The list is first sorted in ascending order, and then the script iterates over the list to fix one element. The two pointers are then used to find a pair of elements that sum to the negation of the fixed element. If such a pair is found, the script returns True. If no such pair is found after iterating over the list, the script returns False.
