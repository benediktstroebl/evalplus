    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:

    Returns:
        bool: True if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, False otherwise.

This code uses a set to store the numbers we have seen so far. For each number in the input list, it checks if there are two other numbers in the set that add up to it. If it finds such a pair of numbers, it returns True. If it doesn't find such a pair after checking all the numbers, it returns False. The test cases are included at the end of the code to verify that the function works correctly.
