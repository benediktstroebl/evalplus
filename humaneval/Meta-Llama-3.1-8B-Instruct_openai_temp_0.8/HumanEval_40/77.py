### Triples Sum to Zero

#### Problem Description

This script checks if there are three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero.

#### Code
```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst: list):
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        lst (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, False otherwise.
    """
    # Sort the list to make it easier to find pairs with a sum greater than any element
    lst.sort()
    
    # Iterate over each element in the list
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        # Initialize two pointers, one starting at the next element and one at the end of the list
        left, right = i + 1, len(lst) - 1
        
        # Continue iterating over the list as long as the pointers haven't crossed over
        while left < right:
            # Calculate the current sum
            current_sum = lst[i] + lst[left] + lst[right]
            
            # If the current sum is zero, return True
            if current_sum == 0:
                return True
            # If the current sum is less than zero, move the left pointer to the right to increase the sum
            elif current_sum < 0:
                left += 1
            # If the current sum is greater than zero, move the right pointer to the left to decrease the sum
            else:
                right -= 1
                
    # If we've iterated over the entire list and haven't found a triple sum to zero, return False
    return False


# Test the function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # Expected output: False
    print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # Expected output: True
    print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # Expected output: False
    print(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))  # Expected output: True
    print(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))  # Expected output: False
```
This script works by sorting the list and then using a two-pointer technique to find a pair that sums to the negation of the current element. If such a pair is found, the script checks if the negation of the sum of the pair and the current element is in the list. If it is, the script returns True. If the script iterates over the entire list without finding a triple sum to zero, it returns False.
