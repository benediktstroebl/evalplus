### Solution
```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
    l (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
    bool: Whether three distinct elements in the list sum to zero.

    Examples:
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
    False
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
    True
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
    False
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])
    True
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1])
    False

### Explanation

This script uses a set to keep track of the elements we've seen so far and another set to store the pairs of elements that sum to zero. It goes through the input list, for each element, it calculates its complement (the element that would sum to zero), and checks if it's in the set of seen elements. If it is, it means we've found a pair that sums to zero, and we add it to the set of pairs. Finally, it returns True if we've found more than one pair that sums to zero, and False otherwise. 

Note: This script has a time complexity of O(n^2) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list.
