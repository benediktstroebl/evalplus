    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        l (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if there are three distinct elements that sum to zero, False otherwise.

This script works by iterating over the list in O(n^2) time. For each number, it checks if the complement (i.e., the number needed to sum to zero) has been seen before. If it has, it immediately returns True. If it hasn't, it adds the current number to the set of seen numbers. If it iterates over the entire list without finding a triple, it returns False.
