    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
    l (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
    bool: Whether there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.

    Examples:
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
    False
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
    True
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
    False
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])
    True
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1])
    False

This script uses a set to keep track of the numbers it has seen so far, which allows it to check for three distinct elements summing to zero in O(n^2) time. The outer loop iterates over each number in the list, and the inner loop checks if the complement of the current number and the previous number is already in the set. If it is, the function returns True. If it goes through the entire list without finding three such numbers, it returns False.
