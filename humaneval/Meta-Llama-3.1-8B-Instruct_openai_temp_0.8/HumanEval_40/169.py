    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.

This script uses a set `seen` to keep track of the elements we have seen so far. It iterates over the list, for each element, it iterates over the rest of the list to find a pair that has a complement which is also in the seen set. If it finds such a pair, it returns True. If it does not find any such pair after iterating over the entire list, it returns False.
