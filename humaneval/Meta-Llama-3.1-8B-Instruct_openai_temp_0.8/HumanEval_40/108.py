In this script, we use a set to store unique elements from the list. We iterate over the list and calculate the complement of each element (i.e., the value that would sum to zero with the current element). We then check if the complement is in the remaining elements (i.e., the elements not yet processed). If it is and the complement is not the current element, we add the combination to the set of zero sums.

Finally, we return True if there is at least one combination that sums to zero, and False otherwise. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's behavior with different input lists.
