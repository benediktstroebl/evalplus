This script defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as input and returns True if there are three distinct elements that sum to zero, and False otherwise. It uses two sets, `seen` and `zero_sum`, to keep track of the elements we have seen so far and the elements that we have seen that sum with another element to zero. If we find a number that sums with its negative to zero, we return True. If we iterated over the entire list and did not find three numbers summing to zero, we return False. The test cases are included at the end of the script.
