### Solution: Triplet Sum to Zero
#### Problem Statement
Given a list of integers, returns True if there are three distinct elements that sum to zero, and False otherwise.

#### Code
```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(nums):
    """
    Returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and False otherwise.
    
    Args:
    nums (list): A list of integers.
    
    Returns:
    bool: Whether three distinct elements sum to zero.
    """
    num_set = set()
    seen = set()
    
    for num in nums:
        complement = - (num)
        
        # Check if the complement is in the set
        if complement in seen:
            # Check if the complement and the current number are both in the original list
            if -complement in num_set and num in num_set:
                return True
        
        # Add the current number to the seen set
        seen.add(num)
        
        # Add the current number to the num_set
        num_set.add(num)
    
    return False

# Example use cases
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```

This solution iterates over the list of numbers and for each number, it checks if its complement (the number that would make the sum zero) is in the `seen` set. If the complement is found, it checks if both the complement and the current number are in the `num_set`. If they are, it returns True. If no such triplet is found after iterating over all numbers, it returns False. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the list.
