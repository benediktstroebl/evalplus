This code works by iterating over all pairs of elements in the list, calculating the complement (the element that would be needed to make the sum zero), and checking if the complement is in the set of seen elements. If it is, then we've found three distinct elements that sum to zero, and we return True. If we've checked all pairs of elements and haven't found three distinct elements that sum to zero, we return False. If the list has less than three elements, we immediately return False, since it's not possible for three distinct elements to sum to zero in this case.
