This script uses two sets, `num_set` and `seen`, to keep track of the elements we've seen so far and the sums of pairs we've seen so far, respectively. It iterates over the list of numbers, and for each number, it checks if there's a pair sum in `seen` such that the negation of the pair sum and the current number are both in `num_set`. If such a pair is found, it returns True. If no such pair is found after checking all numbers, it returns False.
