### Triplets Sum to Zero
#### Problem Description
This script checks if there are three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero.

#### Code
```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.
    
    Args:
    l (list): A list of integers.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if three distinct elements sum to zero, False otherwise.
    """
    seen = set()  # Store the numbers we have seen so far
    pairs = set()  # Store the pairs we have seen so far

    for num in l:
        complement = -num  # The number we need to sum to zero
        # Check if complement has been seen before
        if complement in seen:
            # Check if the pair has been seen before
            if (num, complement) not in pairs and (complement, num) not in pairs:
                return True  # Found three distinct numbers summing to zero
        seen.add(num)  # Add the current number to the seen set
        pairs.add((num, complement))  # Add the pair to the pairs set

    return False  # No three distinct numbers sum to zero


# Test cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))
    print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))
    print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))
    print(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))
    print(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))
```

#### Explanation
This solution works by iterating through the list and for each number, it checks if its complement (the number that would sum to zero) has been seen before. If it has, then it checks if the pair of these two numbers has been seen before. If the pair has not been seen before, then three distinct numbers sum to zero, and we return True.
