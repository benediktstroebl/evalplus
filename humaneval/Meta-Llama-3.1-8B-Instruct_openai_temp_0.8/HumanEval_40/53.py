### Triples Sum to Zero
#### Problem Description

This script checks if there are three distinct elements in the input list that sum to zero.

#### Solution
```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(nums):
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    :param nums: A list of integers.
    :return: A boolean indicating whether there are three distinct elements that sum to zero.
    """
    num_set = set()
    for num in nums:
        complement_set = set(-2 * num, num)
        if len(num_set & complement_set) == 2:
            return True
        num_set.add(num)
    return False

# Example use cases
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```

#### Explanation

This script works by iterating over each number in the input list. For each number, it calculates its complement (i.e., the number that would be needed to make the sum zero) and checks if it is present in the set twice. If a pair of complementary numbers is found, the function immediately returns True.

If no such pair is found after checking all numbers, the function returns False, indicating that there are no three distinct elements that sum to zero. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list.
