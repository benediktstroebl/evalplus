This script defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as input and returns `True` if there are three distinct elements that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise. It uses a sorting and two-pointer technique to efficiently find the three distinct elements. The test cases are also included at the end to demonstrate the function's behavior.
