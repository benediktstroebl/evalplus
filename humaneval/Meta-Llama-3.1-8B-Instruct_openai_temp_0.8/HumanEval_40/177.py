This script defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as input and returns `True` if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise. It uses two sets to keep track of the elements and the sums of pairs of elements we've seen so far. It iterates over the list, checking for triplets that sum to zero as it goes. If it finds a triplet, it returns `True`. If it iterates over the entire list without finding a triplet, it returns `False`.
