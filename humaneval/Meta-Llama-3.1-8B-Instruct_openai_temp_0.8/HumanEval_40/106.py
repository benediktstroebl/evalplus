This script uses a set to store the elements we've seen so far, and another set to store the sums of pairs of elements we've seen so far. It iterates over the list, checking for each number if its negative is in the pair sums set. If it is, it returns True. Otherwise, it adds the current number to the seen set and iterates over the elements we've seen so far, calculating the sums of pairs of elements and adding them to the pair sums set. If we've iterated over the entire list and haven't found three numbers that sum to zero, it returns False.
