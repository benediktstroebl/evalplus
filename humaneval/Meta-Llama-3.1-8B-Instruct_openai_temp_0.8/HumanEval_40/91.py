    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Returns:
    bool: Whether there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.

This function works by maintaining two sets: one to keep track of the numbers we've seen, and one to keep track of the sums we've seen. We iterate over the list, and for each number, we check if there's any pair of numbers we've seen that sums up to the current number. If we find such a pair, we return True. If we don't find such a pair after iterating over the entire list, we return False. This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) where n is the length of the list.
