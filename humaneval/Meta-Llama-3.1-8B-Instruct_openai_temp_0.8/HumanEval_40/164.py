### Triples Sum to Zero Problem Solution
#### Python Script
```python

    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        l (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if three distinct elements sum to zero, False otherwise.

#### Explanation
This script defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list `l` of integers as input. It returns `True` if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise.
The function uses a set `seen` to store unique elements it has seen so far. It iterates over the list `l`, and for each number, it calculates its complement (the number that would sum to zero with the current number). It then checks if the complement minus the current number (i.e., the number we're checking) is in the `seen` set. If it is, it returns `True`, indicating that we have found a triple that sums to zero. If not, it adds the current number to the `seen` set and continues to the next number. If we reach the end of the list without finding a triple that sums to zero, the function returns `False`.
