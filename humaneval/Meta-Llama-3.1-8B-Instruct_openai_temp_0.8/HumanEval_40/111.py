In this script, the `triples_sum_to_zero` function uses two sets, `seen` and `partial_sum`, to keep track of the elements and partial sums we have seen so far. It iterates over the input list, checking for each element if its negative is in the `partial_sum` set or if its complement with respect to zero is in the `seen` set. If such a pair is found, the function immediately returns `True`. If no such pair is found after iterating over the entire list, the function returns `False`.

The `test_triples_sum_to_zero` function is used to test the `triples_sum_to_zero` function with the provided test cases.
