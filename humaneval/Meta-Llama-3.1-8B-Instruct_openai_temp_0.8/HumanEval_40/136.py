### Triple Sum to Zero

The following Python script solves the problem using the concept of three sum problem. It takes a list of integers as an input and returns `True` if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise.

### Code

```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(nums):
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        nums (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if three distinct elements sum to zero, False otherwise.
    """
    # Create sets to store the numbers and their complements
    num_set = set()
    complement_set = set()

    for num in nums:
        # If the complement of the current number is in the set of complements,
        # it means we found three distinct elements that sum to zero.
        if num in complement_set:
            return True
        complement_set.add(-num)

    # If we went through the entire list and didn't find a triplet, return False.
    return False

### Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # Output: False
    print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # Output: True
    print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # Output: False
    print(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))  # Output: True
    print(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))  # Output: False
```

### Explanation

*   The `triples_sum_to_zero` function takes a list of integers as an input and returns `True` if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise.
*   We use two sets: `num_set` to store the numbers from the input list and `complement_set` to store the complements of the numbers in `num_set`.
*   We iterate over the input list. For each number, we check if its complement (i.e., `-num`) is in the `complement_set`. If it is, it means we found three distinct elements that sum to zero, so we return `True`.
*   After iterating over the input list, we return `False` if we didn't find a triplet, indicating that there are no three distinct elements that sum to zero.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the `triples_sum_to_zero` function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list, because we iterate over the list twice (once to build the sets and once to check for triplets).
