    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
    numbers (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
    bool: True if three distinct elements sum to zero, False otherwise.

This script uses a set to store previously seen numbers and their complements. It iterates over the input list, checking if the complement of the current number and any previously seen number is in the set. If a trio with a sum of zero is found, it returns True. If no such trio is found after checking all numbers, it returns False.
