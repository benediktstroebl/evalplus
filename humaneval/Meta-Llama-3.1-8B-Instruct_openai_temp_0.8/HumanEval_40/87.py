    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        nums (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if three distinct elements sum to zero, False otherwise.

    Examples:
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
        False
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])

This function uses a set to store the unique elements in the input list for efficient lookups. It then generates combinations of three distinct numbers and checks if their sum is zero. If it finds a combination that sums to zero, it immediately returns `True`. If it has checked all combinations without finding one that sums to zero, it returns `False`. The time complexity of this approach is O(n^3) in the worst case, where n is the number of unique elements in the input list. However, since the input list is not modified and elements are only added to a set, the space complexity is O(n).
