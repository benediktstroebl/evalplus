    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        l (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: Whether there are three distinct elements that sum to zero.

    Example:
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
        False
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
        True
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
        False
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])
        True
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1])
        False

This script defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that checks whether there are three distinct elements in the input list that sum to zero. The function iterates over the list, keeping track of the numbers it has seen so far in a set. If it encounters a number that, when negated, is in the set, it immediately returns `True`. If it finishes iterating over the list without finding such a number, it returns `False`. The script also includes test cases to verify the function's correctness.
