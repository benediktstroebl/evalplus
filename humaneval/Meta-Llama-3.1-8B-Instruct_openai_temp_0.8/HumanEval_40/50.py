This script defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that solves the problem. It uses two hash sets, `seen` and `seen_twice`, to keep track of the elements it's seen and the elements it's seen twice, respectively. It goes through the input list once, checking for a triple sum to zero. If it finds one, it returns `True`. If it doesn't find one after going through the entire list, it returns `False`. The example use cases are also included in the script.
