    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        l (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if three distinct elements sum to zero, False otherwise.

    Examples:
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
        False
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
        True
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
        False
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])
        True
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1])

This script defines the `triples_sum_to_zero` function, which takes a list of integers as input and returns `True` if there are three distinct elements that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a set to keep track of seen numbers and complements, and iterates over the list twice to find three distinct numbers that sum to zero. If such numbers are found, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The script also includes test cases to verify the correctness of the function.
