This script defines a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as input and returns `True` if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a set to keep track of elements it has seen so far, and iterates through the list to find the required three distinct elements. If it finds two elements whose sum is the negative of the current element, it returns `True`. If it iterates through the entire list without finding three distinct elements, it returns `False`. The script includes test cases to demonstrate its correctness.
