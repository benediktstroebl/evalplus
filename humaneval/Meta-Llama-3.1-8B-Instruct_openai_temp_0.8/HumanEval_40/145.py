This script defines the `triples_sum_to_zero` function, which takes a list of integers as input and returns a boolean indicating whether there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero. The function uses a set to keep track of the elements it has seen so far and checks each element to see if there's a pair in the set that sums to its negative. If it finds such a pair, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The script includes the test cases from the original problem statement.
