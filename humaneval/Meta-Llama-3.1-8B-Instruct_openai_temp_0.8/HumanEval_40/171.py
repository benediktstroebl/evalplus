### Triple Sum to Zero

This Python script checks if there are three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero.

```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(nums: list) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.

    Args:

    Returns:
    bool: True if three distinct elements in the list sum to zero, False otherwise.

```
This script uses a two-pointer technique to find three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero. The list is first sorted in ascending order, and then the outer loop iterates over the list, using the inner loops to check if there are two other elements that sum to the negation of the current element. If such a combination is found, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
