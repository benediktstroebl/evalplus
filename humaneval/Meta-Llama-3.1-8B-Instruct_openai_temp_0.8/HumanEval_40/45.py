This script works by iterating over all elements in the list and using two pointers to find a pair of elements that sum to the negation of the current element. If such a pair is found, the function returns True. If no pair is found after checking all elements, the function returns False. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the length of the list, since we are using two nested loops to check all pairs of elements. The space complexity is O(1), since we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size.
