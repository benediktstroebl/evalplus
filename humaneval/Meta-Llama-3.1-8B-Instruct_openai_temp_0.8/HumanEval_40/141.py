    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Returns:
        bool: True if three distinct elements sum to zero, False otherwise.

This script uses a set to store the elements we've seen so far. For each number in the list, it calculates the complement (the number needed to sum to zero) and checks if we've seen a pair that sums to the complement. If we have, it checks if we've also seen the third number that sums to zero. If we have, it returns True; otherwise, it continues iterating over the list. If it iterates over the entire list without finding three distinct elements that sum to zero, it returns False.
