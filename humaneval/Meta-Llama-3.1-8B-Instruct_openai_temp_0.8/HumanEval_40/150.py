However, the time complexity of this solution is O(n^3) where n is the number of elements in the list, so it may not be efficient for large lists.

Here's a more efficient solution with a time complexity of O(n^2):

```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list) -> bool:
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        l (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if there are three distinct elements that sum to zero, False otherwise.
    """
    num_set = set()
    for num in l:
        complement = -num
        if complement in num_set:
            # Check if the complement and the current number are not the same
            if complement!= num:
                return True
        num_set.add(num)
    return False

# Test cases
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```

This solution works by maintaining a set of numbers we have seen so far. For each number, we check if its complement (i.e., the number that would make the sum equal to zero) is in the set. If it is, we return True. Otherwise, we add the current number to the set. If we finish iterating through the list without finding a triple that sums to zero, we return False.
