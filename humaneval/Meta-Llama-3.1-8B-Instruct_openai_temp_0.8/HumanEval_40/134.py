### Triples Sum to Zero
#### Problem: Check if there are three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero.

```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(lst: list) -> bool:
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        lst (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if three distinct elements in the list sum to zero, False otherwise.

This script uses a set to keep track of the elements we've seen so far and another set to store the triples that sum to zero. It iterates over the list, checking if the complement of each number (its negation) is in the seen set, and if it's not a triple we've seen before. If we find a triple that sums to zero, we add it to the triples set. Finally, we return True if we've seen at least one triple that sums to zero, and False otherwise.
