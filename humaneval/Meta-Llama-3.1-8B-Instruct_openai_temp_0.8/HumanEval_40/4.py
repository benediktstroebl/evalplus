This script works by iterating over the input list and for each element, checking if its negation has been seen before. If it has, it adds the pair to the set of pairs. After iterating over the entire list, it checks if any element and its negation have been seen and if they are not in the set of pairs. If it finds such a pair, it returns True. If it doesn't find any such pair, it returns False.
