    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        l (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: Whether three distinct elements sum to zero.

    Examples:
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
        False
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
        True
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
        False
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])
        True
        >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1])
        False

This script uses a three-pointer technique to find three elements that sum to zero. The first pointer is fixed at the current element, and the other two pointers are initialized at the next element and the end of the list. The script then moves the pointers based on the sum of the three elements to find a sum of zero.
