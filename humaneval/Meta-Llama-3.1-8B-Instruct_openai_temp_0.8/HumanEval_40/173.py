This script uses a two-pointer technique to check for triplets that sum to zero. It sorts the list first to make it easier to find pairs of elements that could sum up to the negation of the current element. Then it iterates over the list and for each element, it moves the two pointers until they meet or until it finds a triplet that sums to zero. If a triplet is found, it immediately returns True. If no triplet is found after checking all elements, it returns False.
