```python
def fib(n: int):
    """
    Return n-th Fibonacci number.

    The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

    Args:
        n (int): The position of the Fibonacci number to return.

    Returns:
        int: The n-th Fibonacci number.

    Examples:
        >>> fib(10)
        55
        >>> fib(1)
        1
        >>> fib(8)
        21
    """
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer")
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 1, 1
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b

# Test the function
print(fib(10))  # Output: 55
print(fib(1))   # Output: 1
print(fib(8))   # Output: 21

This script defines a function `fib(n)` that returns the `n-th` Fibonacci number. The function uses a loop to calculate the Fibonacci number iteratively, which is more efficient than using recursion for large values of `n`. The function also includes a docstring that explains what the function does, its parameters, and its return value, as well as some examples of how to use it.
