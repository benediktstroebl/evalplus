This script defines a function `fizz_buzz` that iterates over the numbers less than the input `n`. It checks each number to see if it's divisible by 11 or 13. If it is, it converts the number to a string and counts the occurrences of the digit '7'. The total count is then returned. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's behavior.
