### Fizz Buzz Solution
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper bound for the range of numbers to check.

    Returns:
        int: The number of times the digit 7 appears.

    Examples:
        >>> fizz_buzz(50)
        0
        >>> fizz_buzz(78)
        2
        >>> fizz_buzz(79)
        3
    """
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        # Check if the number is divisible by 11 or 13
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            # Convert the number to a string to easily check each digit
            str_num = str(i)
            # Count the number of times the digit 7 appears
            count += str_num.count('7')
    return count

# Test the function
print(fizz_buzz(50))  # Output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Output: 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Output: 3
