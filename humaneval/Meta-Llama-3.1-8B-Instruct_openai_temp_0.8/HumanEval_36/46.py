### Fizz Buzz Counter
#### Problem: Count the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit.

    Returns:
        int: The count of the digit 7.
    """
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        # Check if the number is divisible by 11 or 13
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            # Convert the number to a string to easily count the digit 7
            str_i = str(i)
            count += str_i.count('7')
    return count

# Test cases
print(fizz_buzz(50))  # Output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Output: 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Output: 3
```
This script defines the `fizz_buzz` function, which iterates through numbers less than `n`, checks if they are divisible by 11 or 13, and counts the occurrences of the digit 7 in each number. The test cases are provided at the end to demonstrate the function's correctness.
