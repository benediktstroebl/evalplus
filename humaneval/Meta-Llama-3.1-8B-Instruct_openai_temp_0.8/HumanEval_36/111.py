This script defines a function `fizz_buzz` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function iterates over the range of numbers from 1 to `n-1`, checks each number for divisibility by 11 or 13, and then checks each digit in the number to see if it is 7. The count of occurrences of 7 is returned at the end. The script also includes test cases to verify the correctness of the function.
