Here is a Python script that implements the `fizz_buzz` function as specified:
```markdown
### Fizz Buzz Function
#### Description
This script defines a function `fizz_buzz(n)` that counts the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13.

#### Code
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit (exclusive).

    Returns:
        int: The count of digit 7 occurrences.
    """
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            # Convert the number to a string to easily check for the digit 7
            str_i = str(i)
            count += str_i.count('7')
    return count
```

#### Example Usage
```python
print(fizz_buzz(50))  # Output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Output: 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Output: 3
```

#### Running the Script
You can save this code to a file (e.g., `fizz_buzz.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python fizz_buzz.py`). This will execute the example usage and print the results.
```bash
$ python fizz_buzz.py
