In this script, the `count_sevens` function counts the occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13. The `fizz_buzz` function is simply a wrapper around `count_sevens` with the same name as the original problem statement. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's behavior.
