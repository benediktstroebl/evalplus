This script defines a function `fizz_buzz` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13. It uses a for loop to iterate over the range of numbers from 1 to `n-1`, checks each number for divisibility by 11 or 13, and increments a count each time it finds a number containing the digit 7. The function then returns the total count.
