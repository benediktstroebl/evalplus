This Python script defines a function `fizz_buzz` that counts the occurrences of the digit 7 in integers less than a given number `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function iterates over the range of numbers from 1 to `n-1`, checks if each number is divisible by 11 or 13, and increments a counter for each occurrence of the digit 7. The function returns the total count of the digit 7. The script includes test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
