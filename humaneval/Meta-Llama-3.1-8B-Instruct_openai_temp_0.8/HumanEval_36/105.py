This script defines a helper function `count_digit_7` to count the occurrences of the digit 7 in a range of numbers. The `fizz_buzz` function uses this helper function to count the numbers with the digit 7 that are divisible by 11 or 13, and adjusts for the numbers that are divisible by the least common multiple of 11 and 13 (i.e., 143). The test cases at the end demonstrate the correctness of the `fizz_buzz` function.
