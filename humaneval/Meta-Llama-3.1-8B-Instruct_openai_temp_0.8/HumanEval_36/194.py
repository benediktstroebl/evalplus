### Fizz Buzz with Digit 7 Count
#### Problem: Count the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13.

```python
def count_digit_7_appearances(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.

    Args:
    n (int): The upper bound for the integers to check.

    Returns:
    int: The number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.

    for i in range(1, n):  # Iterate over integers from 1 to n-1

        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:

This script defines a function `count_digit_7_appearances` to count the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13. It then defines a function `fizz_buzz` that simply calls `count_digit_7_appearances`. The script includes test cases to verify the correctness of the functions.
