This script defines a function `fizz_buzz` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13. It does this by iterating over all integers less than `n`, checking if each integer is divisible by 11 or 13, and then counting the occurrences of the digit 7 in the string representation of that integer. The result is then returned. The script also includes test cases to demonstrate the function's correctness.
