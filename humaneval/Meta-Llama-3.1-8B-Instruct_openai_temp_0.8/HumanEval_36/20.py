This script defines a function `fizz_buzz` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the count of numbers less than `n` that contain the digit 7 and are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a loop to iterate over the range of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, checks each number for the specified conditions, and increments a count whenever the conditions are met. The test cases at the end of the script demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs.
