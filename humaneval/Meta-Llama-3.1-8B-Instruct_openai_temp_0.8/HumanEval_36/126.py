This script defines the `fizz_buzz` function according to the problem statement. It iterates over the numbers from 1 to `n-1`, checks if each number is divisible by 11 or 13, and if it is, converts it to a string to check for the presence of the digit '7'. If '7' is found, it increments the `count`. The function returns the total count of such numbers. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's behavior with the provided examples.
