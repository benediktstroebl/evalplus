This script defines the `fizz_buzz` function, which iterates over numbers less than the input `n` and checks if they are divisible by 11 or 13. If a number meets this condition and contains the digit 7, it increments the count. The function returns the count at the end. The test cases at the end of the script check if the function behaves as expected for the given inputs.
