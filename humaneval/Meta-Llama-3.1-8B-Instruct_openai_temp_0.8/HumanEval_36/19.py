This script defines two functions: `count_sevens` and `fizz_buzz`. The `count_sevens` function iterates over all numbers less than `n`, checks if a number is divisible by 11 or 13, converts the number to a string, and counts the occurrences of the digit '7'. The `fizz_buzz` function simply calls `count_sevens` to calculate the result. The script includes three test cases to verify the correctness of the `fizz_buzz` function.
