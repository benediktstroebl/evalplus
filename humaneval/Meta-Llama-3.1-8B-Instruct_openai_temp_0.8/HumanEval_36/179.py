Here's a Python script that implements the `fizz_buzz` function:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.

    Args:
    n (int): An integer that represents the upper bound.

    Returns:
    int: The number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
    """
    count = 0
    for i in range(11, n, 11):
        for j in range(13, n, 13):
            if i < j and i < n and j < n:  # Ensure numbers are below the limit and sorted.
                num_str = str(i) + str(j)
                count += num_str.count('7')
    return count

# Test cases
print(fizz_buzz(50))  # Expected output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Expected output: 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Expected output: 3
```
This script uses nested loops to generate numbers that are divisible by 11 or 13, and then checks each of these numbers for the presence of the digit 7. The results are summed up and returned as the final count.
