This script defines a function `fizz_buzz(n)` that iterates over all integers less than `n`, checks if each number is divisible by 11 or 13, and counts the occurrences of the digit 7 in each such number. The function returns the total count of digit 7 occurrences. The test cases are included at the end to demonstrate the function's behavior.
