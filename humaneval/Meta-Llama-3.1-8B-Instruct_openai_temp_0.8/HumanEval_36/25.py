This script defines a function `fizz_buzz(n)` that iterates over all integers less than `n`. For each integer, it checks if it is divisible by 11 or 13. If it is, it counts the number of occurrences of the digit 7 in that integer. The total count is then returned. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's behavior with the expected outputs.
