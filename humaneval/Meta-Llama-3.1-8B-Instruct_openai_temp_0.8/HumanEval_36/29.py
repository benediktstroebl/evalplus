```python

    Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit for checking numbers.

    Returns:
        int: The count of numbers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13 and contain the digit 7.

    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n):

        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            # Convert the number to a string to easily check for the presence of '7'
            str_i = str(i)
            # Count the occurrences of '7' in the string representation of the number

print(fizz_buzz(79))  # 3
```

This script uses a simple loop to iterate over numbers less than `n`, checks if each number is divisible by 11 or 13, and counts the occurrences of the digit 7 in the string representation of these numbers. The result is returned as the function's output.
