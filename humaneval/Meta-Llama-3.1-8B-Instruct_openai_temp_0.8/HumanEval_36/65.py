### Fizz Buzz Function
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit of the range of integers to check.

    Returns:
        int: The number of times the digit 7 appears in the specified range.
    """
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        # Check if the number is divisible by 11 or 13
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            # Convert the number to a string to easily check each digit
            str_i = str(i)
            # Check each digit in the number to see if it's 7
            for digit in str_i:
                if digit == '7':
                    # If the digit is 7, increment the count
                    count += 1
    return count
```

### Example Use Cases
```python
print(fizz_buzz(50))  # Output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Output: 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Output: 3
```
This script defines a function `fizz_buzz` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function uses a loop to iterate over all integers less than `n`, checks each integer to see if it's divisible by 11 or 13, and then checks each digit in the integer to see if it's 7. The function returns the total count of times the digit 7 appears.
