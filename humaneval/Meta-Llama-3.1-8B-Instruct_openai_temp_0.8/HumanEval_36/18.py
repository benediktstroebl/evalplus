### Fizz Buzz Function
```python
def count_sevens(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Count the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.

    Args:
    n (int): The upper limit (exclusive) of the range of numbers to check.

    Returns:
    int: The count of the digit 7 in the specified numbers.
    """
    count = 0  # Initialize count to 0
    for i in range(n):  # Iterate over the range of numbers
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:  # Check if the number is divisible by 11 or 13
            str_i = str(i)  # Convert the number to a string for easy digit access
            count += str_i.count('7')  # Count the occurrences of the digit 7
    return count  # Return the total count

```
This script defines two functions: `count_sevens` and `fizz_buzz`. The `count_sevens` function takes an integer `n` as input, iterates over the range of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and counts the occurrences of the digit 7 in the numbers that are divisible by 11 or 13. The `fizz_buzz` function calls `count_sevens` with the input number. The test cases are then executed to verify the correctness of the functions.
