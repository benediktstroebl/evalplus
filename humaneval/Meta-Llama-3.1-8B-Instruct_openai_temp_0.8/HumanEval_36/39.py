### Fizz Buzz Problem Solution
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """
    Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.

    Args:
    n (int): The upper limit of the range to check.

    Returns:
    int: The number of times the digit 7 appears in the specified range.
    """
    count = 0
    for i in range(n): 
        # Check if the number is divisible by 11 or 13
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            # Convert the number to a string to easily check for the digit 7
            str_i = str(i)
            count += str_i.count('7')
    return count

# Test cases
print(fizz_buzz(50))  # 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # 3
```
This script defines the `fizz_buzz` function, which iterates over all numbers less than the given limit `n`. If a number is divisible by 11 or 13, it converts the number to a string and counts the occurrences of the digit 7. The total count is returned at the end.
