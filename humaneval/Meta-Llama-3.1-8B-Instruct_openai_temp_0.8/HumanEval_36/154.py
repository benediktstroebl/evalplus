### Fizz Buzz Function

#### Description
This script defines a function `fizz_buzz(n)` that calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13.

#### Code
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit (exclusive).

    Returns:
        int: The number of occurrences of the digit 7.

    Examples:
        >>> fizz_buzz(50)
        0
        >>> fizz_buzz(78)
        2
        >>> fizz_buzz(79)
        3
    """
    count = 0
    for i in range(11, n, 11):
        str_i = str(i)
        if '7' in str_i:
            count += 1
    for i in range(13, n, 13):
        str_i = str(i)
        if '7' in str_i:
            count += 1
    return count

# Example usage
print(fizz_buzz(50))  # Output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Output: 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Output: 3
```

#### Explanation
This function iterates over the range of numbers from 11 to `n` (exclusive) in steps of 11 and from 13 to `n` (exclusive) in steps of 13. It converts each number to a string, checks if the digit '7' is present in the string, and increments the count if it is. The function finally returns the total count of occurrences of the digit 7.
