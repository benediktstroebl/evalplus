# Vowels Count Function

## Overview
This script defines a function `vowels_count` that calculates the number of vowels in a given word.
### Requirements
- The function considers 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' as vowels.
- 'y' is considered a vowel when it's at the end of the word.

## Code
```python
def vowels_count(s):
    """
    Calculate the number of vowels in a given word.

    Vowels in this case are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'. 
    'y' is also a vowel, but only when it is at the end of the given word.

    Args:
        s (str): The input word.

    Returns:
        int: The number of vowels in the word.

    Examples:
        >>> vowels_count("abcde")
        2
        >>> vowels_count("ACEDY")
        3
    """
    vowels = 'aeiou'
    # Check if the word ends with 'y' and subtract 1 if it does (since 'y' would be counted twice)
    y_at_end = s.endswith('y')
    # Count the number of vowels in the word (without double counting 'y')
    count = sum(1 for char in s.lower() if char in vowels) - y_at_end
    return count
```

## Example Usage
```python
print(vowels_count("abcde"))  # Output: 2
print(vowels_count("ACEDY"))  # Output: 3
print(vowels_count("Hello"))  # Output: 2
```
