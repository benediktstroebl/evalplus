### Vowels Count
#### Problem Statement
Write a function `vowels_count` which takes a string representing a word as input and returns the number of vowels in the string.
#### Vowels Definition
Vowels in this case are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'. Here, 'y' is also a vowel, but only when it is at the end of the given word.

#### Solution
```python
def vowels_count(s):
    """
    Counts the number of vowels in a given string.

    Vowels in this case are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'. 'y' is also a vowel, but only when it is at the end of the given word.

    Args:
    s (str): The input string.

    Returns:
    int: The number of vowels in the string.

    Examples:
    >>> vowels_count("abcde")
    2
    >>> vowels_count("ACEDY")
    3
    """
    # Convert the string to lowercase for simplicity
    s = s.lower()
    
    # Initialize a counter for vowels
    count = 0
    
    # Initialize a flag to track if the last character was 'y'
    is_last_y = False
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for char in s:
        # Check if the character is a vowel or 'y' at the end of the string
        if char in 'aeiou':
            count += 1
        elif char == 'y' and (s == char or s.endswith(char)):
            is_last_y = True
        # If the last character was 'y' and the current character is not a vowel, reset the flag
        elif is_last_y and char not in 'aeiouy':
            is_last_y = False
    
    # Return the count of vowels
    return count
```

#### Test Cases
```python
print(vowels_count("abcde"))  # Expected output: 2
print(vowels_count("ACEDY"))  # Expected output: 3
```

#### Fix for Additional Test Cases
To add more test cases, you can simply add more `print` statements with the `vowels_count` function called with different inputs. For example:
```python
print(vowels_count("hello"))  # Expected output: 2
print(vowels_count("world"))  # Expected output: 1
```
You can add as many test cases as you need to ensure the `vowels_count` function is working correctly.
