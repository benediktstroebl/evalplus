### Vowels Count Function
```python
def vowels_count(s):
    """
    This function takes a string representing a word as input and returns 
    the number of vowels in the string. Vowels in this case are 'a', 'e', 
    'i', 'o', 'u'. Here, 'y' is also a vowel, but only when it is at the 
    end of the given word.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        int: The number of vowels in the string.

    Example:
        >>> vowels_count("abcde")
        2
        >>> vowels_count("ACEDY")
        3
    """
    # Convert the string to lowercase to handle both lowercase and uppercase letters
    s = s.lower()
    
    # Initialize count of vowels
    count = 0
    
    # Check if the last character is 'y'
    if s[-1] == 'y':
        # If the last character is 'y' and not at the end of the string
        if len(s) > 1 and s[-2]!= 'y':
            pass
        else:
            # Increment the count by 1 for the 'y' at the end
            count += 1
    
    # Check for each character in the string if it's a vowel
    for char in s:
        # If the character is a vowel, increment the count by 1
        if char in 'aeiou':
            count += 1
    
    # Return the total count of vowels
    return count
```

### Example Use Cases
```python
# Test the function with example strings
print(vowels_count("abcde"))    # Expected output: 2
print(vowels_count("ACEDY"))    # Expected output: 3
print(vowels_count("Hello"))    # Expected output: 2
print(vowels_count("World"))    # Expected output: 1
print(vowels_count("AEIOUY"))   # Expected output: 6
```
This code defines a function `vowels_count` that takes a string `s` as input, counts the number of vowels in the string, and returns the count. It handles both lowercase and uppercase letters by converting the input string to lowercase before counting the vowels. Additionally, it treats 'y' as a vowel only when it is at the end of the word.
