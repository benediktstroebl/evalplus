### Vowels Count Function
#### Python Script
```python
FIX = """
Add more test cases.
"""

def vowels_count(s):
    """
    Counts the number of vowels in a given string.

    Vowels in this case are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'. 'Y' is also a vowel
    when it is at the end of the given word.

    Args:
        s (str): Input string representing a word.

    Returns:
        int: Number of vowels in the string.

    Examples:
        >>> vowels_count("abcde")
        2
        >>> vowels_count("ACEDY")
        3

    # Convert the string to lowercase for simplicity
    s = s.lower()
    # Initialize count of vowels
    count = 0
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for char in s:
        # Check if character is a vowel
        if char in 'aeiou' or (char == 'y' and s[-1] == 'Y' and s[-2:] == 'y'):
            # If it's a vowel, increment the count
            count += 1
    # Return the count of vowels
    return count

```
This script defines a function `vowels_count` that takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels in the string. The function first converts the input string to lowercase for simplicity. Then it iterates over each character in the string, checks if the character is a vowel, and increments a count if it is. The function returns the count of vowels. The script also includes test cases to demonstrate the function's correctness.
