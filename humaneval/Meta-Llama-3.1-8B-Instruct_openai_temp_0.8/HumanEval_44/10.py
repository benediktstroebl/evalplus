This script defines a function `change_base` that changes the base of a given integer. It works by repeatedly taking the remainder of the input number divided by the target base and appending the remainder to the list of digits. It continues this process until the input number is reduced to 0. The list of digits is then reversed and joined together to form the string representation of the number in the target base.
