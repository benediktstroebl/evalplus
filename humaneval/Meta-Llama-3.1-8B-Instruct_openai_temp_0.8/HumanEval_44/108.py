```python

    """Change numerical base of input number x to base.
    return string representation after the conversion.
    base numbers are less than 10.
    >>> change_base(8, 3)
    '22'
    >>> change_base(8, 2)
    '1000'
    >>> change_base(7, 2)
    '111'
    """
    if x == 0:
        return '0'
    
    digits = []
    while x:
        digits.append(int(x % base))
        x //= base
    
    return ''.join(map(str, reversed(digits)))

# Test the function
print(change_base(8, 3))  # '22'
print(change_base(8, 2))  # '1000'
print(change_base(7, 2))  # '111'
```

This script uses a while loop to continuously divide the input number `x` by the target base and append the remainder to the list of digits. The list is then reversed and joined into a string. If `x` becomes 0, it immediately returns '0'. This approach ensures that the function works for any base less than 10 and correctly handles the conversion of positive and zero integers.
