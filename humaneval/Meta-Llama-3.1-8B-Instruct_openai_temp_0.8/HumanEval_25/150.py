This script uses a simple trial division method to find the prime factors of a given number. The loop starts from 2 and increments the divisor by 1 until it is no longer divisible into the number. If the number is divisible, it is divided and the divisor is added to the list of factors. This process repeats until the number is reduced to 1. The final number left after dividing is also a prime factor and is added to the list.
