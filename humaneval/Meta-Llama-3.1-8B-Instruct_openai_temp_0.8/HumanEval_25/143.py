This script works by dividing the input number `n` by increasing integers `i` until `n` is reduced to 1. Each time `n` is divided by `i`, `i` is added to the list of factors. This process continues until `n` is reduced to 1, at which point the list of factors is returned. The condition `i * i <= n` is used to optimize the loop, as any factors larger than the square root of `n` would have already been found by smaller factors.
