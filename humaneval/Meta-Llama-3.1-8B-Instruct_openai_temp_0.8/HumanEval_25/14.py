This script uses a simple trial division method to find the prime factors of the input number. It starts from 2, the smallest prime number, and checks if the input number is divisible by it. If it is, it divides the number by the current factor and adds it to the list of factors. It continues this process until the number is reduced to 1. If the number is a prime number, it is added to the list of factors. The function finally returns the list of factors.
