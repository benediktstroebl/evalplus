```python
from typing import List


def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors

    Args:
    n (int): The number to factorize.

    Returns:
    List[int]: A list of prime factors.

    Example:
    >>> factorize(8)
    [2, 2, 2]
    >>> factorize(25)
    [5, 5]
    >>> factorize(70)
    [2, 5, 7]

This script works by continuously checking if the given number `n` is divisible by the current number `i`. If it is, then `i` is a factor and we divide `n` by `i` and add `i` to the list of factors. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, then we increment `i` by 1. We continue this process until `i` squared is greater than `n`, at which point `n` must be a prime number and we add it to the list of factors.
