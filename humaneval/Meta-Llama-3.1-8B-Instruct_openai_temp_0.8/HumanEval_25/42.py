```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors

    Args:
        n (int): Input integer to be factorized.

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of prime factors.

    Examples:
        >>> factorize(8)
        [2, 2, 2]
        >>> factorize(25)
        [5, 5]
        >>> factorize(70)
        [2, 5, 7]

This script defines a function `factorize` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors, with each factor appearing the number of times it occurs in the factorization. It uses a while loop to divide the input number by increasing integers, starting from 2, until it is no longer divisible. The factors are then collected in a list. The list is sorted and duplicate factors are removed by converting it to a set and back to a list. The function is tested with several examples.
