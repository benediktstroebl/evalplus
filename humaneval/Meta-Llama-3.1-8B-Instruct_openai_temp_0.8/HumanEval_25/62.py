```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors

    Args:
        n (int): The input number to be factorized

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of prime factors of the given integer

    Examples:
        >>> factorize(8)
        [2, 2, 2]
        >>> factorize(25)
        [5, 5]

        [2, 5, 7]

This script uses a simple algorithm to find the prime factors of a given number. It iterates from 2 to the square root of the number, checking if the current number is a factor. If it is, it divides the number by the factor and adds the factor to the list. If it is not, it increments the number. After the loop, if the remaining number is greater than 1, it means the number is a prime number and it adds it to the list. The function finally returns the list of prime factors.
