### Factorize Function
```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors

    Args:
        n (int): The input number to be factorized.

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of prime factors of the input number.

    Examples:
        >>> factorize(8)
        [2, 2, 2]
        >>> factorize(25)
        [5, 5]
        >>> factorize(70)
        [2, 5, 7]
    """
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors

# Test the function
print(factorize(8))  # Output: [2, 2, 2]
print(factorize(25))  # Output: [5, 5]
print(factorize(70))  # Output: [2, 5, 7]
```
In this script, the `factorize` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors. The function uses a while loop to divide `n` by the smallest prime number (which is 2) as long as it is divisible. It then moves on to the next number until `n` becomes 1 or the square root of `n` is reached. The factors are stored in a list and returned at the end. If `n` is a prime number greater than 1, it is appended to the list of factors.
