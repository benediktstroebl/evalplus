### Prime Factorization Script
```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors

    Args:
        n (int): The number to be factorized

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of prime factors
    """
    i = 2
    factors = []
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors

# Example usage
print(factorize(8))  # Output: [2, 2, 2]
print(factorize(25))  # Output: [5, 5]
print(factorize(70))  # Output: [2, 5, 7]
```
This script uses a simple trial division method to find the prime factors of a given number. The algorithm works by dividing the input number `n` by the smallest prime number (2) as long as it's divisible. Then it increments the divisor until it finds the next number that can divide `n`, which is guaranteed to be a prime number. This process continues until `n` is reduced to 1.
