### Prime Factorization Script
```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors

    Args:
    n (int): The number to factorize

    Returns:
    List[int]: A list of prime factors

    Examples:
    >>> factorize(8)
    [2, 2, 2]
    >>> factorize(25)
    [5, 5]
    >>> factorize(70)
    [2, 5, 7]
    """
    i = 2
    factors = []
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors

# Test the function
print(factorize(8))   # [2, 2, 2]
print(factorize(25))  # [5, 5]
print(factorize(70))  # [2, 5, 7]
```
This script uses a while loop to divide the input number `n` by increasing integers `i` until `n` is reduced to 1. If `n` is divisible by `i`, then `i` is a factor and `n` is divided by `i`. The factor `i` is added to the list of factors. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, then `i` is incremented by 1. This process continues until `n` is reduced to 1, at which point the list of factors is returned.
