### Prime Factorization of an Integer
```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors

    Args:
        n (int): The number to factorize.

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of prime factors of the given integer.

    Examples:
        >>> factorize(8)
        [2, 2, 2]
        >>> factorize(25)
        [5, 5]
        >>> factorize(70)
        [2, 5, 7]
    """
    i = 2
    factors = []
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors

# Example use cases
print(factorize(8))  # [2, 2, 2]
print(factorize(25))  # [5, 5]
print(factorize(70))  # [2, 5, 7]
```
This script uses a simple trial division method to find the prime factors of a given integer. It iteratively checks for divisibility starting from 2 and then moving up to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by the current factor, it is divided by that factor and the factor is added to the list of factors. This process continues until the number is reduced to 1, at which point all prime factors have been found.
