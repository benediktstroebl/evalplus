```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors

    Args:
        n (int): The number to factorize.

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of prime factors of n.

    Examples:
        >>> factorize(8)
        [2, 2, 2]
        >>> factorize(25)
        [5, 5]
        >>> factorize(70)
        [2, 5, 7]

This script uses a simple trial division method to factorize the input number. It starts by checking if the number is divisible by 2, then by 3, 4, 5, and so on. If the number is divisible by a certain number, it divides the number by that number and adds it to the list of factors. This process continues until the number is reduced to 1. If the number is prime, it will be added to the list of factors at the end.
