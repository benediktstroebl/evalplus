### Factorization Script
```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors

    Args:
        n (int): The number to factorize

    Returns:
        List[int]: List of prime factors
    """
    i = 2
    factors = []
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors

# Test cases
print(factorize(8))  # [2, 2, 2]
print(factorize(25))  # [5, 5]
print(factorize(70))  # [2, 5, 7]
```
This script uses a simple trial division method to find all prime factors of a given number. It starts by dividing the number by the smallest prime number, 2, and continues to divide by the next number until it finds a factor. If the current number is not divisible by any of the previous numbers, it increments the current number. This process continues until the number is reduced to 1. The final list of factors is returned.
