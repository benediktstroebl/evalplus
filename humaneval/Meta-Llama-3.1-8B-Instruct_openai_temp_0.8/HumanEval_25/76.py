In this script, we use a simple trial division method to factorize the input number `n`. The idea is to divide `n` by the smallest prime number (2) as long as it's divisible. Then we increment the divisor until we find the next number that can divide `n`, and repeat this process until `n` is reduced to 1. The list of divisors obtained in this way is the list of prime factors of `n`. If `n` is a prime number itself, it will be added to the list as the last element.
