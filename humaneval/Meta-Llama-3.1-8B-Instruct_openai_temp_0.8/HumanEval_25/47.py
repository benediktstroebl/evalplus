This script uses a simple algorithm to factorize the input number. It starts by dividing the number by 2 (the smallest prime number) as long as it's divisible. Then it increments the divisor by 1 and continues the process until the number is reduced to 1. This process ensures that all prime factors are found in the correct order (from smallest to largest). The number of times each factor appears in the list corresponds to how many times it appears in the factorization.
