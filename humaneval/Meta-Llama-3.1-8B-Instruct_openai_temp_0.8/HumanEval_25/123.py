```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors
    
    Parameters:
    n (int): The number to be factorized.
    
    Returns:
    List[int]: A list of prime factors.
    
    Examples:
    >>> factorize(8)
    [2, 2, 2]
    >>> factorize(25)
    [5, 5]
    >>> factorize(70)
    [2, 5, 7]

This script uses a simple trial division method to find the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It starts from 2, the smallest prime number, and checks if it divides `n`. If it does, it divides `n` by the factor and adds it to the list of factors. This process continues until `n` is reduced to 1. If `n` is greater than 1 at the end of this process, it means that `n` itself is a prime factor and is added to the list. The function returns the list of prime factors.
