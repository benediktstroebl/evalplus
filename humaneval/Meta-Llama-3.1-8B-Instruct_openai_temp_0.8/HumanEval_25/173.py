### Prime Factorization in Python
```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors

    Args:
        n (int): The number to factorize

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of prime factors

    >>> factorize(8)
    [2, 2, 2]
    >>> factorize(25)
    [5, 5]
    >>> factorize(70)
    [2, 5, 7]
    """
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
You can use this script by calling the `factorize` function with a number as argument. For example:
```python
print(factorize(8))  # Output: [2, 2, 2]
print(factorize(25))  # Output: [5, 5]
print(factorize(70))  # Output: [2, 5, 7]
```
This script works by dividing the input number `n` by the smallest prime number (2) as long as it is divisible. Then it increments the divisor until it finds the next number that can divide `n`, which will be a prime number. This process continues until `n` is reduced to 1. The list of divisors obtained in this process is the list of prime factors of `n`.
