### Factorizing an Integer into Prime Factors
### ============================================

Below is a Python script that implements a function to factorize a given integer into its prime factors.

```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors

    Args:
        n (int): The input number to be factorized.

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of prime factors of the input number.
    """
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors

# Example usage:
print(factorize(8))  # [2, 2, 2]
print(factorize(25))  # [5, 5]
print(factorize(70))  # [2, 5, 7]
```

This script works by dividing the input number `n` by the smallest prime factor (which is 2) as long as it's divisible. It then increments the divisor until it finds the next one that can divide `n`. This process continues until `n` is reduced to 1. The list of divisors obtained in this manner will be the list of prime factors of the original number.
