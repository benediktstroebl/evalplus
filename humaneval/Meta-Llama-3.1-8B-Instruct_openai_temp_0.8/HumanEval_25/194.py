This script defines a function `factorize` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors. The function uses a while loop to divide the input number `n` by the smallest prime factor `i` as long as it's divisible. The process continues until `i` is greater than the square root of `n`. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `n` is still greater than 1 after the loop, it means that `n` is a prime number and it's added to the list of factors. The function finally returns the list of factors.
