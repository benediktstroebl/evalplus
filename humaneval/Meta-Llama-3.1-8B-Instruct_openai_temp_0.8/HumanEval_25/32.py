### Prime Factorization
```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors

    Args:
        n (int): The number to factorize

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of prime factors of n

    Examples:
        >>> factorize(8)
        [2, 2, 2]
        >>> factorize(25)
        [5, 5]
        >>> factorize(70)
        [2, 5, 7]
    """
    i = 2
    factors = []
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors

# Test the function
print(factorize(8))  # Output: [2, 2, 2]
print(factorize(25))  # Output: [5, 5]
print(factorize(70))  # Output: [2, 5, 7]
```
This script uses a simple trial division method to find the prime factors of a given number. It starts by checking if the number is divisible by 2 (the smallest prime number), and if it is, it divides the number by 2 and adds 2 to the list of factors. It continues this process with increasing integers until it finds an integer that cannot divide the number evenly. If the remaining number is greater than 1, it means that the remaining number is a prime factor and is added to the list of factors. The function returns the list of factors.
