This script uses a simple trial division method to find the prime factors of a given number. It starts by checking if `n` is divisible by 2, then increases the divisor incrementally until the square root of `n` is reached. If `n` is divisible by the current divisor, it is divided by that divisor and the divisor is added to the list of factors. This process continues until `n` is reduced to 1.
