### Prime Factorization in Python
```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The input number to factorize.
    
    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of prime factors.
    """
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors

# Example usage:
print(factorize(8))  # [2, 2, 2]
print(factorize(25))  # [5, 5]
print(factorize(70))  # [2, 5, 7]
```
This script uses a simple trial division method to find the prime factors of the input number `n`. It iteratively divides `n` by the smallest divisor `i` until it can no longer do so, at which point it increments `i` and continues. If the remainder is never 0, then `n` itself is a prime number and is appended to the list of factors.
