This script uses a simple trial division method to find the prime factors of the given number `n`. It iterates through all numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by the current number. If it is, it adds the current number to the list of factors and divides `n` by the current number. This process is repeated until `n` is reduced to 1, at which point all prime factors have been found.
