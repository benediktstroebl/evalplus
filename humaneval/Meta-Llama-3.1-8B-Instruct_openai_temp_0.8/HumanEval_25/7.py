### Factorize Function
```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appeares in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors

    Args:
        n (int): The number to be factorized.

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of prime factors.

    Examples:
        >>> factorize(8)
        [2, 2, 2]
        >>> factorize(25)
        [5, 5]
        >>> factorize(70)
        [2, 2, 5, 7]
    """
    i = 2
    factors = []
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors


# Example usage
print(factorize(8))  # [2, 2, 2]
print(factorize(25))  # [5, 5]
print(factorize(70))  # [2, 2, 5, 7]
```
This function works by dividing the input number `n` by the smallest prime number `i` as long as `n` is divisible by `i`. This process is repeated until `n` is reduced to 1. The list of factors is then returned.
