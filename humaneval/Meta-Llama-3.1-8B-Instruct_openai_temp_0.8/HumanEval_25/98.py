```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors

    Args:
        n (int): The number to factorize.

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of prime factors.

    Examples:
        >>> factorize(8)
        [2, 2, 2]
        >>> factorize(25)
        [5, 5]

This script defines a function `factorize(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors. The function uses a while loop to divide the input number by increasing integers, adding the divisor to the list of factors each time it is divided. This process continues until the input number is reduced to 1, at which point the list of factors is returned. The function also includes a test to handle the case where the input number itself is a prime number.
