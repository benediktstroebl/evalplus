### Prime Factorization Script
```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors

    Args:
        n (int): The number to factorize.

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of prime factors.

    Examples:
        >>> factorize(8)
        [2, 2, 2]
        >>> factorize(25)
        [5, 5]
        >>> factorize(70)
        [2, 5, 7]
    """
    i = 2
    factors = []
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors

# Example usage
print(factorize(8))   # [2, 2, 2]
print(factorize(25))  # [5, 5]
print(factorize(70))  # [2, 5, 7]
```
This script uses a simple trial division method to find the prime factors of a given number. It keeps dividing the number by the smallest prime factor until it can no longer be divided evenly, then moves on to the next prime factor. This process continues until the number is reduced to 1. The final list of prime factors is then returned.
