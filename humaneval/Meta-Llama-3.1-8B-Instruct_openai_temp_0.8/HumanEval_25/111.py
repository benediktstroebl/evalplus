This script uses a trial division method to find the prime factors of a given number. It starts by dividing the number by the smallest prime number (2) and continues dividing by increasing prime numbers until the number is reduced to 1. The prime factors are added to the `factors` list each time the number is divided by a prime factor. If a number itself is a prime factor, it is added to the list at the end. The list of prime factors is then returned.
