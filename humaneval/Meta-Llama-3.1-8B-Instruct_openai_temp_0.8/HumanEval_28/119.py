### Concatenating List of Strings into a Single String

Below is a self-contained Python script that fulfills the requirements of the problem.

```python
from typing import List

def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string

    Args:
    strings (List[str]): List of strings to be concatenated

    Returns:
    str: Concatenated string

    Examples:
    >>> concatenate([])
    ''
    >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'abc'
    """
    # Use the join function to concatenate all strings in the list
    # The join function requires a string as a separator, in this case, an empty string
    return ''.join(strings)


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(concatenate([]))  # Output: ''
    print(concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c']))  # Output: 'abc'
```

This script defines a function `concatenate` that takes a list of strings as input. It uses the `join` function to concatenate all strings in the list into a single string, with an empty string as the separator. The function has a docstring that describes its behavior, parameters, and return value, as well as provides examples of how to use it. The script also includes example usage in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to demonstrate the function's behavior.
