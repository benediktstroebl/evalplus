### Concatenating a List of Strings
#### Problem Description
The task is to write a Python function that concatenates a list of strings into a single string.

#### Solution
```python
from typing import List


def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string.

    Args:
        strings (List[str]): A list of strings to be concatenated.

    Returns:
        str: A single string that is the result of concatenating all input strings.

    Examples:
        >>> concatenate([])
        ''
        >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
        'abc'
    """
    # Use the built-in join function to concatenate all strings in the input list
    # The join function returns a string in which the elements of the input list have been joined by the string on which the join method was called
    # In this case, we call the join method on an empty string, so the elements of the input list will be joined without any separator
    return ''.join(strings)
```
#### Explanation
The provided Python code defines a function called `concatenate` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string that is the result of concatenating all input strings.

The function uses the built-in `join` method to concatenate all strings in the input list. The `join` method returns a string in which the elements of the input list have been joined by the string on which the `join` method was called. In this case, we call the `join` method on an empty string, so the elements of the input list will be joined without any separator.

You can use this function as shown in the examples in the docstring to concatenate lists of strings.
