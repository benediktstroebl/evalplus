### Concatenate List of Strings

Here's a Python script that defines a function `concatenate` to combine a list of strings into a single string.

```markdown
### Code

```python
from typing import List


def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string.

    Args:
        strings (List[str]): A list of strings to concatenate.

    Returns:
        str: A single string resulting from concatenating the input list.

    Examples:
        >>> concatenate([])
        ''
        >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
        'abc'
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
```

### Usage

You can use the `concatenate` function to combine lists of strings in the following way:

```python
print(concatenate([]))  # Output: ''
print(concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c']))  # Output: 'abc'
print(concatenate(['Hello, ', 'world!']))  # Output: 'Hello, world!'
```

This script uses the built-in `join` method of Python's string class to concatenate the input list of strings into a single string. The `join` method takes an iterable of strings and concatenates them with the string on which it's called in between each pair of strings. If the string on which `join` is called is an empty string, as in this case, it simply concatenates the input strings without any separators.
