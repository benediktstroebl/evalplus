### Concatenating List of Strings into a Single String

Below is a Python script that defines a function `concatenate` to concatenate a list of strings into a single string.

```python
from typing import List

def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string.

    Args:
        strings (List[str]): A list of strings to be concatenated.

    Returns:
        str: A single string that is the concatenation of all strings in the input list.
    """
    # Use the join() method to concatenate all strings in the list
    return ''.join(strings)

# Test cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test with an empty list
    print(concatenate([]))  # Should print: ''

    # Test with a list of strings
    print(concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c']))  # Should print: 'abc'
```

In this script, the `concatenate` function uses the `join()` method to concatenate all strings in the input list. This method is more efficient than using the `+` operator to concatenate strings in a loop, as it avoids creating intermediate strings. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's behavior with an empty list and a list of strings.
