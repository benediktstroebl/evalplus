### Concatenating a List of Strings into a Single String
```python
from typing import List

def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate a list of strings into a single string.

    Args:
        strings (List[str]): A list of strings to concatenate.

    Returns:
        str: A single string resulting from concatenating all input strings.

    Example:
        >>> concatenate([])
        ''
        >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
        'abc'
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
```
In this script, we define a function `concatenate` that takes a list of strings as input and returns their concatenation as a single string. We use the `join` method of an empty string (`''`) to concatenate all strings in the input list.

Note: The `join` method is more efficient and Pythonic than using the `+` operator for string concatenation in a loop, especially for large lists.
