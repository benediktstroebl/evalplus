### Concatenating List of Strings into a Single String

A Python function that concatenates a list of strings into a single string is provided below. This function uses the built-in `join` method of strings in Python.

```python
from typing import List

def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string

    Args:
        strings (List[str]): A list of strings to be concatenated

    Returns:
        str: A single string that is the concatenation of all input strings
    """
    # Use the join method to concatenate all strings in the list
    # The join method takes an iterable of strings and concatenates them with the string it's called on in between each pair of strings
    # Since we want no strings in between, we call it on an empty string
    return ''.join(strings)

# Test cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(concatenate([]))  # Should print an empty string
    print(concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c']))  # Should print "abc"
```

This script provides a function `concatenate` that takes a list of strings and returns a single string that is the concatenation of all input strings. The `join` method is used to concatenate all strings in the list. The script also includes test cases to verify its correctness.
