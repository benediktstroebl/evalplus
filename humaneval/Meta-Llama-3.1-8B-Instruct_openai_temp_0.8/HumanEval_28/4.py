### Concatenating a List of Strings into a Single String
#### Using Python's Built-in `join()` Method

```python
from typing import List

def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate list of strings into a single string.

    Args:
        strings (List[str]): A list of strings to be concatenated.

    Returns:
        str: A single string resulting from the concatenation of the input list.

    Example usage:
        >>> concatenate([])
        ''
        >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
        'abc'
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
```

This script uses the `join()` method to concatenate the input list of strings into a single string. The `join()` method returns a string concatenated with the elements of an iterable. In this case, an empty string is used as the separator, effectively concatenating the strings without any additional characters.

You can run this script in a Python environment and test the `concatenate()` function with different inputs to see its behavior.
