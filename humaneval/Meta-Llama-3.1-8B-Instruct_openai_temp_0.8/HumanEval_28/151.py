### Concatenating a List of Strings into a Single String
#### Solution

```python
from typing import List

def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """Concatenate a list of strings into a single string.

    Args:
        strings (List[str]): A list of strings to concatenate.

    Returns:
        str: The concatenated string.

    Examples:
        >>> concatenate([])
        ''
        >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
        'abc'
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
```

#### Explanation

This solution utilizes Python's built-in `join()` function, which concatenates all the items in an iterable (in this case, a list of strings) into a single string. The `''` argument tells `join()` to use an empty string as the separator, effectively concatenating the strings without any additional characters between them.

You can run this script and test the `concatenate()` function with different inputs to verify its correctness.
