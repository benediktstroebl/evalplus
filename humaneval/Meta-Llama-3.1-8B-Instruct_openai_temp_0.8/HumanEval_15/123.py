```python

    Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit of the sequence.

    Returns:
        str: A string containing space-delimited numbers from 0 to n.

    >>> string_sequence(0)
    '0'
    >>> string_sequence(5)
    '0 1 2 3 4 5'

    return''.join(map(str, range(n + 1)))

# Example usage:
print(string_sequence(0))  # Output: '0'
print(string_sequence(5))  # Output: '0 1 2 3 4 5'
```

This script uses the `join()` method to concatenate the numbers in the sequence into a string, separated by spaces. The `map()` function is used to convert each number in the sequence to a string, so that they can be joined together. The `range()` function generates the sequence of numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive).
