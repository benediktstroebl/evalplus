This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of "<" and ">" characters as input. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. For each character in the string, if it's an opening bracket, it's pushed onto the stack. If it's a closing bracket, the stack is checked for emptiness. If the stack is empty, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns False. If the stack is not empty, the opening bracket is popped from the stack. After checking all characters, if the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns True. If the stack is not empty, it means there are some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns False.
