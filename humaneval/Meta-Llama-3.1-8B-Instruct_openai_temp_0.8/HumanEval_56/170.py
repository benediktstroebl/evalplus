This script uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets encountered in the string. For each closing bracket encountered, it checks if the stack is empty (i.e., there's no corresponding opening bracket). If the stack is empty, it returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the corresponding opening bracket from the stack. After iterating over the entire string, it returns False if there are any remaining opening brackets in the stack, and True otherwise.
