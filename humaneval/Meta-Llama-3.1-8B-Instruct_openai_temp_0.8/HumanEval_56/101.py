    # Initialize a counter for opening brackets
    opening_brackets = 0
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for bracket in brackets:

However, we can solve this problem more efficiently using a stack data structure in Python. A stack is a collection which follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where an element added to the stack is removed from the same position where it was added.

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """
    Checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
    brackets (str): A string of "<" and ">".

    Returns:
    bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """
    # Initialize an empty stack
    stack = []
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for bracket in brackets:
        # If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
        if bracket == "<":
            stack.append(bracket)
        # If the character is a closing bracket, pop the corresponding opening bracket from the stack
        elif bracket == ">":
            if not stack:  # If the stack is empty, there's no corresponding opening bracket, return False
                return False
            stack.pop()
    
    # If there are any opening brackets left in the stack, return False
    return not stack

# Test cases
print(correct_bracketing("<"))  # False
print(correct_bracketing("<>"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("<<><>>"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("><<>"))  # False
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of characters in the string, because we make a single pass through the string. The space complexity is also O(n) because in the worst case, we might need to push all characters onto the stack.
