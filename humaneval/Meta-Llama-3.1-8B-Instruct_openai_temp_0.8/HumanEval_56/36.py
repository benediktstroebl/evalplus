This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty (meaning there's no corresponding opening bracket) or pops the opening bracket from the stack. After checking all brackets, it returns whether the stack is empty (meaning every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket) or not.
