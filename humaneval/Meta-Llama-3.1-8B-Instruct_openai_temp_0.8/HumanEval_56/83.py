This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of "<" and ">" characters as input. It uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, that means there's no matching opening bracket, so the function returns `False`. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. At the end of the function, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, that means every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns `True`. If the stack is not empty, that means there were some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns `False`.
