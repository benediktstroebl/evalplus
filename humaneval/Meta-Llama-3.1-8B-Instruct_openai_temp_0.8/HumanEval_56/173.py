This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty and returns False if it is (i.e., there's no corresponding opening bracket). If the stack is not empty, it pops the corresponding opening bracket from the stack. After checking all brackets, it returns True if the stack is empty (i.e., all opening brackets were closed).
