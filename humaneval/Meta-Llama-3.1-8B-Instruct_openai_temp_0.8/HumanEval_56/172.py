This script uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. Whenever it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. After iterating over the entire string, if the stack is empty, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
