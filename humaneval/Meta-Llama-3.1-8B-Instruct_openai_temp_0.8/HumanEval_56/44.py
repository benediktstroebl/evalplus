This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty (meaning there's no corresponding opening bracket) or pops the opening bracket from the stack. If there are any opening brackets left in the stack after processing the entire string, it means there's no corresponding closing bracket for those opening brackets.
