This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and iterates over the string. If it encounters a closing bracket and the stack is empty, it returns False. If it encounters a closing bracket and the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. Finally, it checks if the stack is empty after iterating over the string. If it is, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
