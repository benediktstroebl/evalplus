### Correct Bracketing Function

This Python script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that checks if every opening bracket (`<`) has a corresponding closing bracket (`>`).

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
    brackets (str): A string of "<" and ">".

    Returns:
    bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the balance between opening and closing brackets
    balance = 0
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for bracket in brackets:
        # If the character is an opening bracket, increment the counter
        if bracket == "<":
            balance += 1
        # If the character is a closing bracket, decrement the counter
        elif bracket == ">":
            balance -= 1
            # If the balance becomes negative, it means there's an extra closing bracket, so return False
            if balance < 0:
                return False
    
    # After iterating over the entire string, if the balance is 0, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so return True
    # Otherwise, return False
    return balance == 0


# Test cases
print(correct_bracketing("<"))  # False
print(correct_bracketing("<>"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("<<><>>"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("><<>"))  # False
```

This script uses a counter to keep track of the balance between opening and closing brackets as it iterates over the string. If the balance becomes negative at any point, it means there's an extra closing bracket, so the function returns False. If the balance is 0 after iterating over the entire string, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns True.
