```python

    Checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
    brackets (str): A string of "<" and ">".

    Returns:
    bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.

# Test cases

This script uses the `count()` method of Python strings to count the number of "<" and ">" characters in the input string. If the counts are equal, it returns `True`, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
