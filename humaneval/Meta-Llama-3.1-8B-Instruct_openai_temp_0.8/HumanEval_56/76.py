This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets it encounters. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty (which means there's no corresponding opening bracket) or pops the opening bracket from the stack. Finally, it checks if there are any remaining opening brackets on the stack, which means they don't have a corresponding closing bracket.
