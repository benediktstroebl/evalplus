This script uses a stack data structure to efficiently keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates over each character in the string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them off when corresponding closing brackets are encountered. If a closing bracket is encountered when the stack is empty, it immediately returns `False`. Finally, it checks if the stack is empty at the end, and if so, returns `True` to indicate that all brackets were correctly paired.
