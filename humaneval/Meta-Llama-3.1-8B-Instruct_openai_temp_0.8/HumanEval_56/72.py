This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty (i.e., there's no corresponding opening bracket). If it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. At the end, it returns True if the stack is empty and False otherwise, indicating whether every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
