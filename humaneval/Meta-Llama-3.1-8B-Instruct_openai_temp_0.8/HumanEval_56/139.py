This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates through the string of brackets. If it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. If it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it returns False because there's no matching opening bracket. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. After iterating through the entire string, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, every opening bracket had a matching closing bracket, so it returns True. If the stack is not empty, there are opening brackets without matching closing brackets, so it returns False.
