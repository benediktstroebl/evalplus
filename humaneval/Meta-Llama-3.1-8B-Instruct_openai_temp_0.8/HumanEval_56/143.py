In this script, we use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, we return False because there's no corresponding opening bracket. If the stack is not empty, we pop the corresponding opening bracket from the stack. Finally, we return True if the stack is empty after processing all brackets, meaning every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
