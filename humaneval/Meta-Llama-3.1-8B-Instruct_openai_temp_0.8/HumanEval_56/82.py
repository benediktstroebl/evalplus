This script uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets. It iterates over each character in the string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them off when it encounters a corresponding closing bracket. If the stack is empty after iterating over the entire string, every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
