This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. After iterating over the entire string, if the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns True. If the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so the function returns False.
