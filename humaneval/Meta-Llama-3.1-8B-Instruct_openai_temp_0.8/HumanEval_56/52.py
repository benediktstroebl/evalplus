This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of "<" and ">" characters and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and `False` otherwise. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and checks if the top of the stack matches the closing bracket. If there are any remaining opening brackets in the stack at the end, it returns `False`, indicating that the bracketing is incorrect.
