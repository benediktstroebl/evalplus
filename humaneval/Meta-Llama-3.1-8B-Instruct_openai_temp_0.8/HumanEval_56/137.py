This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates over the string from left to right. Whenever it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. Whenever it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. After processing all brackets, if the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns True. If the stack is not empty, it means there are some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so it returns False.
