This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if the stack is empty (i.e., there's no corresponding opening bracket). If the stack is empty, it returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the corresponding opening bracket from the stack. After processing all characters, it returns True if the stack is empty (i.e., every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket) and False otherwise.
