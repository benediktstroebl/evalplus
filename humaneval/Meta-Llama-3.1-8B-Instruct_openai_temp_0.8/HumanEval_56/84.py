This script uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty or its top element is not an opening bracket. If either condition is true, it returns False. If the stack is empty after processing all brackets, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns True.
