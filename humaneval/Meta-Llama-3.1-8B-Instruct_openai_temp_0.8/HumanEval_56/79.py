This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of brackets as input and returns True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and False otherwise. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far. If a closing bracket is encountered before a matching opening bracket, or if an opening bracket is encountered without a matching closing bracket, the function returns False. If the function finishes processing all brackets without returning False, it returns True if the stack is empty (meaning every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket), and False otherwise.
