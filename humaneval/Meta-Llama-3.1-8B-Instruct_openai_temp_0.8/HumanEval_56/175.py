This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered in the string. For each closing bracket, it checks if there's a matching opening bracket on the stack. If not, it immediately returns False. If the stack is empty at the end, it means all brackets were matched, so it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
