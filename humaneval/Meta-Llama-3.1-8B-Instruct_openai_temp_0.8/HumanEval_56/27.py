This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of '<' and '>' characters as input and returns True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and False otherwise. The function uses a counter to keep track of the number of unmatched opening brackets. The test cases at the end of the script demonstrate the function's behavior.
