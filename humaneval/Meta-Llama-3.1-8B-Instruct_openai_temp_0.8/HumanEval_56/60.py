In this code, we use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When we encounter an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the stack is empty (i.e., there's no matching opening bracket). If it's not empty, we pop the matching opening bracket from the stack. Finally, we return whether the stack is empty, which means all opening brackets were paired.
