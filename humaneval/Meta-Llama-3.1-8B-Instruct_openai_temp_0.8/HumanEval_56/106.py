This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of "<" and ">" characters as input and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a counter to keep track of the balance between opening and closing brackets, and returns `False` as soon as it encounters a closing bracket without a corresponding opening one.
