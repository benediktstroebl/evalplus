This script uses a stack data structure to track the opening brackets. When an opening bracket is encountered, it's pushed onto the stack. When a closing bracket is encountered, the top element is popped from the stack if it's an opening bracket. If the stack is empty when a closing bracket is encountered, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket. After processing all the brackets, the function returns whether the stack is empty (i.e., every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket).
