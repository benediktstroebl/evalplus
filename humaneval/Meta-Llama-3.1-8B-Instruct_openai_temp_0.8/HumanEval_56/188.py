This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` which takes a string of "<" and ">" as input and returns True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise. It uses a counter to keep track of the number of opening brackets that have not been closed yet. If the number of opening and closing brackets are equal and the counter is zero at the end, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's behavior.
