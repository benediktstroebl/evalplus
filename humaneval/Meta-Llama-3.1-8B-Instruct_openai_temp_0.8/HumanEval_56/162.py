In this script, the `correct_bracketing` function uses a counter to keep track of the number of opening brackets encountered. If it encounters a closing bracket when there are no opening brackets (i.e., the counter is 0), or if there are any remaining opening brackets at the end of the string, it immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.
