In this script, we use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When we encounter an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the stack is empty (i.e., there's no matching opening bracket). If it is, we return False. If the stack is not empty, we pop the matching opening bracket from the stack. Finally, we return True if the stack is empty after iterating over the entire string, indicating that all brackets matched.
