### Correct Bracketing
#### Problem Statement
Given a string of `<` and `>`, determine if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

#### Solution
```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    Returns True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
    
    Args:
    brackets (str): A string consisting of '<' and '>' characters.

    Returns:
    bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """
    # Initialize a counter to track the balance of opening and closing brackets
    balance = 0
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for bracket in brackets:
        # If the character is an opening bracket, increment the counter
        if bracket == '<':
            balance += 1
        # If the character is a closing bracket, decrement the counter
        elif bracket == '>':
            balance -= 1
            # If the counter is negative, it means there's an extra closing bracket
            if balance < 0:
                return False
    
    # After iterating over the entire string, if the counter is 0, every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket
    return balance == 0

# Test cases
print(correct_bracketing("<"))       # False
print(correct_bracketing("<>"))       # True
print(correct_bracketing("<<><>>"))   # True
print(correct_bracketing("><<>"))     # False
```
This solution uses a counter to track the balance of opening and closing brackets. It iterates over each character in the string, incrementing the counter for opening brackets and decrementing it for closing brackets. If the counter becomes negative, it means there's an extra closing bracket, so the function returns False. Finally, after iterating over the entire string, if the counter is 0, every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns True.
