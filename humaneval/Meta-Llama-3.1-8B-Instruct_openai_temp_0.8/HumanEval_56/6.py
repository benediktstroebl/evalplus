This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When an opening bracket is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. When a closing bracket is encountered, it is checked if the stack is empty. If it is empty, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns False. If the stack is not empty, the opening bracket is popped from the stack. After iterating through all brackets, the function returns True if the stack is empty (meaning every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket) and False otherwise.
