This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that checks if every opening bracket in a given string has a corresponding closing bracket. It uses a counter to keep track of the number of opening brackets encountered so far, and returns `False` as soon as it encounters a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket. If it finishes iterating over the string without returning `False`, it checks if there are any unmatched opening brackets by checking the value of the counter. If there are no unmatched opening brackets, it returns `True`.
