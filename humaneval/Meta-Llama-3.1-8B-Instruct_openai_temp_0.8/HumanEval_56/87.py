This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of opening brackets. It iterates over the string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them off when it encounters a closing bracket. If it encounters a closing bracket when the stack is empty, it immediately returns False. Finally, it returns True if the stack is empty after checking all brackets, and False otherwise.
