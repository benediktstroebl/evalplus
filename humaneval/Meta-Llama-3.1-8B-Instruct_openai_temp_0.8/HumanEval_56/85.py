This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far. When a closing bracket is encountered, the script checks if the stack is empty (meaning there's no corresponding opening bracket) or pops the top element from the stack (corresponding to the closing bracket). Finally, the script returns whether the stack is empty after processing all brackets. If the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets.
