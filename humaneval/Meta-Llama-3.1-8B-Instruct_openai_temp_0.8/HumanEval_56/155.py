This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If it's not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack, effectively matching it with the closing bracket. After iterating over the entire string, if the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, and the function returns True. If the stack is not empty, it means there were some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, and the function returns False.
