This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that checks if every opening bracket in a given string has a corresponding closing bracket. It uses a counter to keep track of the number of opening brackets that have not been closed. If the counter is 0 at the end of the string, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The script also includes test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
