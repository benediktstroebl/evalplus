In this script, we use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the top of the stack is an opening bracket. If it is, we pop it from the stack; if not, or if the stack is empty, we immediately return False. If we finish iterating over the string and the stack is empty, we return True; otherwise, we return False.
