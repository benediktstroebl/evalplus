This Python script utilizes a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered. When an opening bracket is encountered, it's pushed onto the stack. When a closing bracket is encountered, the stack is checked for an opening bracket. If the stack is empty, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns False. If the stack is not empty, the opening bracket is popped from the stack. After iterating through all the brackets, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it is, that means every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns True. If the stack is not empty, it means there were unmatched opening brackets, so the function returns False.
