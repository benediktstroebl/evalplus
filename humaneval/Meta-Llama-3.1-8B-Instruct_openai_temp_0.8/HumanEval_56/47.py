This script uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. After iterating over all brackets, it returns False if there are remaining opening brackets in the stack.
