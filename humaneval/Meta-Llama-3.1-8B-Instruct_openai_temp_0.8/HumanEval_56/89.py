This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of "<" and ">" as input and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a counter to keep track of the number of opening brackets that have not been closed yet. If the counter is not 0 after iterating over the entire string, the function returns `False`. If the function hasn't returned `False` by now, the string has correct bracketing, so the function returns `True`.
