This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of "<" and ">" as input and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and `False` otherwise. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and checks if there's a corresponding closing bracket for each opening bracket. The test cases at the end are used to verify the correctness of the function.
