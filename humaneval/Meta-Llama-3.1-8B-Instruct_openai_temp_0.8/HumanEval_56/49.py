This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that uses a stack to check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. The function iterates over each bracket in the input string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them off when it encounters a closing bracket. If it encounters a closing bracket that does not match the top of the stack or if there are remaining opening brackets at the end, it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True. The script also includes a test function `test_correct_bracketing` to test this function with the provided test cases.
