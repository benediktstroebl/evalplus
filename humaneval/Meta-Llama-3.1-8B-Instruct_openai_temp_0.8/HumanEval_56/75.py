This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates through the string of brackets and pushes every opening bracket onto the stack. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is not empty and pops the corresponding opening bracket from the stack. If it encounters a closing bracket and the stack is empty, it returns False. After iterating through all the brackets, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it returns True, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. If the stack is not empty, it returns False, indicating that there are unmatched opening brackets.
