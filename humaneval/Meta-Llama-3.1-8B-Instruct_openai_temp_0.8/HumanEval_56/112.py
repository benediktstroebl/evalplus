This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of `<` and `>` characters as input. It uses a counter to keep track of the number of opening brackets encountered so far. If a closing bracket is encountered, the counter is decremented. If the counter ever becomes negative (i.e., there is a closing bracket without a corresponding opening one), the function immediately returns `False`. After iterating over the entire string, the function returns `True` if the counter is zero (i.e., every opening bracket has a corresponding closing one) and `False` otherwise.
