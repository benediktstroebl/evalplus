This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of "<" and ">" as input and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and `False` otherwise. It uses a counter `balance` to keep track of the balance between opening and closing brackets, and iterates over each character in the string to update the balance accordingly. Finally, it checks if the balance is zero after iterating over the entire string and returns the result.
