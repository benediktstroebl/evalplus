This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered in the string. If a closing bracket is encountered and the stack is empty, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns False. After iterating over the entire string, if the stack is empty, every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
