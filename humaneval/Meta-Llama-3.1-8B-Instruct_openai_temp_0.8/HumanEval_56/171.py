Here's a Python script that uses a stack data structure to solve this problem.

## Correct Bracketing
### Problem Statement
Given a string of "<" and ">", return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

### Code
```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    Check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
    brackets (str): A string of "<" and ">".

    Returns:
    bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """
    # Use a stack to keep track of opening brackets
    stack = []
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for bracket in brackets:
        # If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
        if bracket == "<":
            stack.append(bracket)
        # If the character is a closing bracket, check if the stack is empty
        elif bracket == ">":
            # If the stack is empty, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket
            if not stack:
                return False
            # If the stack is not empty, pop the opening bracket from the stack
            else:
                stack.pop()
    
    # After iterating over the entire string, check if the stack is empty
    # If the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket
    # If the stack is not empty, it means there are some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets
    return not stack


# Test cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(correct_bracketing("<"))  # Output: False
    print(correct_bracketing("<>"))  # Output: True
    print(correct_bracketing("<<><>>"))  # Output: True
    print(correct_bracketing("><<>"))  # Output: False
```

### Explanation
This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of opening brackets. When the script encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. After iterating over the entire string, the function checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns True. If the stack is not empty, it means there are some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns False.
