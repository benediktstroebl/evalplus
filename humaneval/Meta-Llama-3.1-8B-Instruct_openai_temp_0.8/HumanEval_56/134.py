This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that checks if every opening bracket in a given string has a corresponding closing bracket. It uses a simple counter to keep track of the balance between opening and closing brackets. If an opening bracket is encountered, the counter is incremented; if a closing bracket is encountered, the counter is decremented. The function returns `False` as soon as it encounters an unbalanced closing bracket or an unbalanced string. Otherwise, it returns `True`.
