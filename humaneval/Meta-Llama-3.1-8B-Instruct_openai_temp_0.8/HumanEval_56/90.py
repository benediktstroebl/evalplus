```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if every opening bracket in the given string has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
    brackets (str): A string consisting of "<" and ">".

    Returns:
    bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """
    return brackets.count("<") == brackets.count(">")

# Test cases
print(correct_bracketing("<"))  # False
print(correct_bracketing("<>"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("<<><>>"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("><<>"))  # False
```

However, if you'd like to implement this using a stack data structure, here's how you can do it:

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if every opening bracket in the given string has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
    brackets (str): A string consisting of "<" and ">".

    Returns:
    bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "<":
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == ">":
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack

# Test cases
print(correct_bracketing("<"))  # False
print(correct_bracketing("<>"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("<<><>>"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("><<>"))  # False
```

This version of the function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket, so it returns False. If it's not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. At the end, it returns whether the stack is empty (True) or not (False), which means whether all opening brackets have been matched with a closing bracket or not.
