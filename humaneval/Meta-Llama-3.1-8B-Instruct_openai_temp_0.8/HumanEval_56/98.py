This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far. It iterates over the string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them off when a corresponding closing bracket is found. If a closing bracket is encountered without a corresponding opening bracket or if an opening bracket is found without a corresponding closing bracket, it immediately returns False. If the stack is empty after processing all brackets, it returns True, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
