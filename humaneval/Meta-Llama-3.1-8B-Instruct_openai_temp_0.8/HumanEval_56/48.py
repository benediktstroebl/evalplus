    # Initialize a counter for opening and closing brackets
    opening_count = 0

    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for bracket in brackets:

# Test cases
print(correct_bracketing("<"))  # Expected output: False

However, there is a simpler solution using a stack data structure, which better fits the problem's requirements (efficiently handling unmatched open and close brackets).

    """
    Function to check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
    brackets (str): A string of "<" and ">".

    Returns:
    bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """

    # Create a stack and iterate over each character in the string
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        # If the character is an opening bracket, push it to the stack
        if bracket == "<":
            stack.append(bracket)
        # If the character is a closing bracket, pop from the stack
        elif bracket == ">":
            if not stack:
                # If the stack is empty, there is no corresponding opening bracket
                return False
            stack.pop()

    # If the stack is empty at the end, every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket
    return not stack


# Test cases
