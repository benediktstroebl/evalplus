This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, then the closing bracket does not have a corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. After iterating over all brackets, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, then every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns True. If the stack is not empty, then there are some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns False.
