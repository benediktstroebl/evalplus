This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates over the string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them off when it encounters a closing bracket. If it encounters a closing bracket when the stack is empty, it returns False because there's no corresponding opening bracket. Finally, it returns True if the stack is empty after iterating over the entire string, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
