This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of `<` and `>` characters as input. It uses a counter to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far and checks if every closing bracket has a corresponding opening bracket. The function returns `True` if the brackets are correctly paired and `False` otherwise. The test cases at the end verify the correctness of the function.
