This Python script defines the `correct_bracketing` function, which checks whether every opening bracket in the input string has a corresponding closing bracket. The function works by maintaining a counter for the difference between the number of opening and closing brackets encountered so far. If the counter ever goes below 0, it means there's a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns False. After iterating over the entire string, the function returns True if the counter is 0 (i.e., every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket) and False otherwise. The script also includes test cases to demonstrate the function's correctness.
