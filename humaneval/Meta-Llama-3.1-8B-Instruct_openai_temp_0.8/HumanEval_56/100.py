This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of "<" and ">" as input and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and `False` otherwise. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and pops them off when it encounters a corresponding closing bracket. If the stack is empty after processing the entire string, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
