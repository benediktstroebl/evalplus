In this script, we use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets we encounter. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, we return False because there is no corresponding opening bracket. If the stack is not empty, we pop the corresponding opening bracket from the stack. After processing all brackets, we return True if the stack is empty (meaning every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket) and False otherwise.
