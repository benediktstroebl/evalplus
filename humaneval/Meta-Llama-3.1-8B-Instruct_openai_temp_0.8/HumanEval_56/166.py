This script uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, there's no corresponding opening bracket for the closing bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. After iterating over all brackets, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns True. If the stack is not empty, there's an opening bracket without a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns False.
