This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if there is a corresponding opening bracket in the stack by popping it from the stack. If the stack becomes empty at any point or is not empty at the end, it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.
