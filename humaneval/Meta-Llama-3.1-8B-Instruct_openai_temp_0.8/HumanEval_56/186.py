### Correct Bracketing Function

This script implements a function `correct_bracketing` that checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in a given string.

#### Code
```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    This function checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
        brackets (str): A string consisting of "<" and ">".

    Returns:
        bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """
    stack = []  # Initialize an empty stack
    for bracket in brackets:  # Iterate over the string
        if bracket == "<":  # If the bracket is an opening bracket
            stack.append(bracket)  # Push it onto the stack
        elif bracket == ">":  # If the bracket is a closing bracket
            if not stack:  # If the stack is empty
                return False  # Return False because there's no corresponding opening bracket
            stack.pop()  # Pop the corresponding opening bracket from the stack
    return not stack  # Return True if the stack is empty, False otherwise

# Example use cases
print(correct_bracketing("<"))  # False
print(correct_bracketing("<>"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("<<><>>"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("><<>"))  # False
```

#### Explanation

The `correct_bracketing` function uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far. It iterates over the string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them off when a corresponding closing bracket is encountered. If a closing bracket is encountered when the stack is empty, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns False. If the function finishes iterating over the string without finding any mismatches, it returns True if the stack is empty (meaning every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket) and False otherwise.
