### Correct Bracketing Function
#### Solution in Python

This Python function checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in a given string of "<" and ">".
```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """
    Checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
        brackets (str): A string of "<" and ">".

    Returns:
        bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """
    stack = []  # Initialize an empty stack
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "<":  # Push opening bracket onto the stack
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == ">":  # If the stack is empty, return False
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()  # Pop the opening bracket from the stack
    return not stack  # If the stack is empty, all brackets were matched, otherwise they weren't


# Example use cases
print(correct_bracketing("<"))  # False
print(correct_bracketing("<>"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("<<><>>"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("><<>"))  # False
```

This function uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty (which means there's no corresponding opening bracket) and returns False if so. If it successfully pops the opening bracket from the stack, it continues. After processing all brackets, it checks if the stack is empty, which means all brackets were matched and returns True, or returns False if there are any opening brackets left in the stack.
