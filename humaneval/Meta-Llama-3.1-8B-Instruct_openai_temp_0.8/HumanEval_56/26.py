This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of opening brackets. It iterates over each bracket in the input string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them when it encounters a corresponding closing bracket. If the stack is empty after iterating over all brackets, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
