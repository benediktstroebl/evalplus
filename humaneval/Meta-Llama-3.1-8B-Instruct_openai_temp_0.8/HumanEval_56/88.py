This script uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, there's no corresponding opening bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. After iterating over the entire string, if the stack is not empty, there are unmatched opening brackets, so it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.
