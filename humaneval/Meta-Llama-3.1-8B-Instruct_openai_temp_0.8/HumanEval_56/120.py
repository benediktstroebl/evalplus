This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of "<" and ">" as input and returns a boolean indicating whether every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and checks for matching closing brackets as it iterates over the string. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's behavior.
