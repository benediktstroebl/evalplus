This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that checks if a string of "<" and ">" characters has correct bracket pairings. The function uses a counter to keep track of the number of open brackets encountered. If a closing bracket is encountered when the counter is 0, it means there's no matching opening bracket, so the function returns False. After iterating over the entire string, if the counter is not 0, it means there are unpaired opening brackets, so the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.

The script includes the specified test cases to verify the correctness of the function.
