This script uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. After checking all brackets, it returns True if the stack is empty (all brackets were correctly matched) and False otherwise.
