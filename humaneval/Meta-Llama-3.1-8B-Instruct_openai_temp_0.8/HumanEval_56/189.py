### Correct Bracketing Checker
```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    Returns True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
        brackets (str): A string of "<" and ">".

    Returns:
        bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """
    stack = []
    
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for bracket in brackets:
        # If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
        if bracket == "<":
            stack.append(bracket)
        # If the character is a closing bracket and the stack is not empty, pop the opening bracket from the stack
        elif bracket == ">" and stack:
            stack.pop()
    
    # If the stack is empty after iterating over the entire string, every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket
    return not stack

# Test cases

```
This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of "<" and ">" as input. It uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. If the stack is empty after iterating over the entire string, every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
