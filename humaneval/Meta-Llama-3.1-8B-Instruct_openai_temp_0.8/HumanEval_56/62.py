This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the corresponding opening bracket from the stack. After iterating over the entire string, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
