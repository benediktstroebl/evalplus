In this script, the `correct_bracketing` function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets that have not been closed yet. It iterates over the string of brackets. When it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty or its top element is not an opening bracket. If either condition is true, it returns False, indicating that there is a mismatched bracket. If the function finishes processing all brackets without returning False, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it returns True, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. Otherwise, it returns False.
