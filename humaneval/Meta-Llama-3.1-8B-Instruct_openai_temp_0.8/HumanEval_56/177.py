This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of "<" and ">" as input and returns True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and False otherwise. The function uses a counter to keep track of the number of opening brackets encountered so far, and returns False as soon as it encounters a closing bracket when the counter is 0. If it finishes iterating over the string without returning False, it returns True if the counter is 0 (indicating every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket), and False otherwise.
