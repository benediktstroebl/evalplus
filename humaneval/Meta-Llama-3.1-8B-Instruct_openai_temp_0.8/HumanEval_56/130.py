This script uses a counter to keep track of the opening brackets encountered. When a closing bracket is found, it decrements the counter. If the counter is 0 when a closing bracket is found, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so it returns False. After iterating over the entire string, it checks if there are any remaining opening brackets and returns False if there are, because they don't have corresponding closing brackets.
