This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that checks if every opening bracket in a given string has a corresponding closing bracket. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and `False` otherwise. The script also includes test cases to verify the correctness of the function.
