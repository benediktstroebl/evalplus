This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty (indicating no corresponding opening bracket) or if it can pop the corresponding opening bracket from the stack. At the end, it returns whether the stack is empty (indicating all brackets were correctly paired).
