This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of "<" and ">" as input and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket and `False` otherwise. The function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and iterates through the string to check if every opening bracket has a matching closing bracket. The script also includes test cases to verify the function's correctness.
