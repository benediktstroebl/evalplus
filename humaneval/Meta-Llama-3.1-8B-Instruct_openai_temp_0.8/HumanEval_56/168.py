This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of "<" and ">" as input, and returns True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and False otherwise. The function uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets that haven't been matched yet. If it encounters a closing bracket and the stack is empty, it returns False. After processing all brackets, it checks if the stack is empty. If it's not, it means there are some opening brackets that haven't been matched, so it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.
