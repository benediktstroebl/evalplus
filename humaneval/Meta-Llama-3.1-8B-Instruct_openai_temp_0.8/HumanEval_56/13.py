    Checks if every opening bracket in the input string has a corresponding closing bracket.

```

This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered in the input string. If a closing bracket is encountered without a corresponding opening bracket on the stack, the function immediately returns `False`. After iterating over the entire string, the function returns `True` if the stack is empty (indicating all brackets were properly matched) and `False` otherwise.
