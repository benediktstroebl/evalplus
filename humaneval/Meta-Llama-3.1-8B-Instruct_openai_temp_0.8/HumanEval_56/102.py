This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of opening brackets. When it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. If the stack is empty, it returns False because there's no corresponding opening bracket. After iterating over the entire string, if the stack is empty, it returns True because every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. If the stack is not empty, it returns False because there are unmatched opening brackets.
