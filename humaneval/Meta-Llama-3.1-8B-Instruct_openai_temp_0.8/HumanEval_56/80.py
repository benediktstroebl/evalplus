This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of '<' and '>' characters as input and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket and `False` otherwise. The function uses a counter to keep track of the opening brackets and checks for mismatched brackets as it iterates over the string. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's behavior on various inputs.
