This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of "<" and ">" as input and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates over the input string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them off when it encounters a corresponding closing bracket. If the stack is empty at the end, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The script includes the test cases specified in the problem.
