This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets it has seen. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, that means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. After iterating over the entire string, it checks if there are any opening brackets left in the stack. If there are, that means there's no corresponding closing bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is empty, that means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns True.
