This script defines the `correct_bracketing` function that takes a string of "<" and ">" as input and returns True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise. The function uses a simple counter to track the balance of brackets and returns False as soon as it encounters a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket or an opening bracket without a corresponding closing bracket. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's correctness.
