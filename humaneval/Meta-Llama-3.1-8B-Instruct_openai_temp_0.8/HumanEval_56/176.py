This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of `<` and `>` characters as input and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and `False` otherwise. It uses a simple iterative approach to count the number of opening and closing brackets. If the count of opening brackets is not zero at the end of the iteration, it means there are some opening brackets without corresponding closing ones, and the function returns `False`.
