### Correct Bracketing Checker
#### Python Script
```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
        brackets (str): A string containing only "<" and ">".

    Returns:
        bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "<":
            # Push opening bracket onto the stack
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == ">":
            # If the stack is empty, there's no corresponding opening bracket
            if not stack:
                return False
            # Pop the corresponding opening bracket from the stack
            stack.pop()
    # If the stack is empty, every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket
    return not stack

# Test cases
print(correct_bracketing("<"))  # False
print(correct_bracketing("<>"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("<<><>>"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("><<>"))  # False
```
This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of "<" and ">" and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and `False` otherwise. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. If the stack is empty when a closing bracket is encountered, or if there are any remaining opening brackets in the stack after processing the entire string, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.
