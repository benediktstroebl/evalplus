This script uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. The `correct_bracketing` function iterates over the input string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them off when a corresponding closing bracket is found. If any opening bracket is encountered without a corresponding closing bracket, the function immediately returns `False`. After iterating over all brackets, the function checks if the stack is empty; if it is, the function returns `True`, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.
