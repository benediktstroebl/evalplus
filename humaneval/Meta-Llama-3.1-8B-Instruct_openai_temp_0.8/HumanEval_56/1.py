This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of "<" and ">" as input and returns a boolean indicating whether every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and returns False as soon as it encounters a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket. If the function finishes iterating over the string without returning False, it checks if the stack is empty, and if it is, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The test cases are included to demonstrate the function's correctness.
