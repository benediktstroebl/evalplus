This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates over the string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them off when it encounters a closing bracket. If it encounters a closing bracket when the stack is empty, it returns False. After iterating over the entire string, it returns True if the stack is empty (meaning every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket) and False otherwise.
