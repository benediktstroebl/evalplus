This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. After processing all brackets, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
