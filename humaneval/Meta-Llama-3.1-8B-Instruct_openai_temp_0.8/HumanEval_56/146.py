This script defines the `correct_bracketing` function that uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets. It iterates over the string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them off when it encounters a corresponding closing bracket. If it encounters a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, it immediately returns `False`. After iterating over the entire string, it returns `True` if the stack is empty (meaning every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket) and `False` otherwise. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's correctness.
