### Correct Bracketing Validation
```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    Validate if every opening bracket in the given string has a corresponding closing bracket.
    
    Args:
        brackets (str): A string containing only '<' and '>' characters.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
