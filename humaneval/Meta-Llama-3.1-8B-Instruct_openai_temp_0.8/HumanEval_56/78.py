This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty (in which case the opening bracket didn't have a corresponding closing bracket) or pops the opening bracket from the stack. Finally, it checks if the stack is empty at the end. If it is, that means every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns True. If the stack isn't empty, that means there were some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so it returns False.
