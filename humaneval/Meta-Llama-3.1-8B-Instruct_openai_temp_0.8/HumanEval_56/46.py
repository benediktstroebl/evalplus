This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of "<" and ">" as input and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and `False` otherwise. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and checks if the stack is empty after iterating over the entire string. The function also includes test cases to verify its correctness.
