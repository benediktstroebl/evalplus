This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of '<' and '>' characters as input and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a counter to track the balance of opening and closing brackets, returning `False` as soon as it encounters an unbalanced bracket.
