This script uses a simple stack-based approach to keep track of the balance between opening and closing brackets. It iterates over each character in the string, incrementing the balance for opening brackets and decrementing it for closing brackets. If the balance ever goes negative, it means there's an extra closing bracket, so the function immediately returns False. After iterating over the entire string, if the balance is zero, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
