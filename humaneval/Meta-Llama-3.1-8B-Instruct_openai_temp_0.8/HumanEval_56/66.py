This script uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if there's a corresponding opening bracket on the stack. If the stack is empty when a closing bracket is encountered, it returns False. After processing all brackets, it checks if the stack is empty. If it's not empty, there are unmatched opening brackets, and it returns False. If the stack is empty, it returns True.
