This Python script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. Whenever it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. Whenever it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty (meaning there's no corresponding opening bracket) or pops the opening bracket off the stack. At the end, if the stack is empty, it means all brackets were matched, so it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
