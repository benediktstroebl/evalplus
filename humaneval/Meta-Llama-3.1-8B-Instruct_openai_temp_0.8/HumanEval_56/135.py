In this script, the `correct_bracketing` function uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets. When it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that there's no corresponding opening bracket for the closing bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. After iterating over the entire string, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns True. If the stack is not empty, it means that there are some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so it returns False.
