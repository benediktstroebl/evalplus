This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of "<" and ">" characters and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and `False` otherwise. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. If an opening bracket is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. If a closing bracket is encountered, it is checked if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty (i.e., there is no corresponding opening bracket), the function returns `False`. If the stack is not empty, the opening bracket at the top of the stack is popped. After processing all brackets, the function returns `True` if the stack is empty (i.e., all brackets have corresponding pairs) and `False` otherwise. The test cases are included in the script to demonstrate its correctness.
