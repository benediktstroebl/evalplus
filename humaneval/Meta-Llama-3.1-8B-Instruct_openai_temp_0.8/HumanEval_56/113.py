Alternatively, you can use a stack-based approach to solve this problem in a more concise way:

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """
    Checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
    brackets (str): A string of "<" and ">".

    Returns:
    bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "<":
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == ">":
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack

# Test cases
print(correct_bracketing("<"))  # False
print(correct_bracketing("<>"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("<<><>>"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("><<>"))  # False
```
