This script uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets encountered in the string. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty, indicating that there's no corresponding opening bracket. If the stack is not empty, it pops the corresponding opening bracket from the stack. After iterating over the entire string, it returns True if the stack is empty (all brackets were correctly paired), and False otherwise.
