This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of "<" and ">" as input and returns a boolean indicating whether every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. It uses a counter to keep track of the number of opening brackets, incrementing it for each opening bracket and decrementing it for each closing bracket. If the counter ever reaches 0 when we encounter a closing bracket, or if there are any remaining opening brackets at the end, we return False. Otherwise, we return True.
