### Correct Bracketing Function
```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """
    Checks if every opening bracket in the string has a corresponding closing bracket.
    
    Args:
    brackets (str): A string consisting of "<" and ">" characters.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """
    stack = []  # Initialize an empty stack
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for bracket in brackets:
        # If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
        if bracket == "<":
            stack.append(bracket)
        # If the character is a closing bracket, check if the stack is empty
        elif bracket == ">":
            # If the stack is empty, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so return False
            if not stack:
                return False
            # If the stack is not empty, pop the opening bracket from the stack
            else:
                stack.pop()
    
    # After iterating over the entire string, if the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so return True
    # If the stack is not empty, it means there were some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so return False
    return not stack

# Test cases
print(correct_bracketing("<"))  # False
print(correct_bracketing("<>"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("<<><>>"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("><<>"))  # False
```
This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that checks if every opening bracket in a given string has a corresponding closing bracket. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and their corresponding closing brackets. If the stack is empty after iterating over the entire string, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The test cases are included at the end to demonstrate the function's behavior.
