In this script, we use a stack data structure (implemented as a list) to keep track of the opening brackets. For each character in the string, we check if it's an opening bracket. If it is, we add it to the stack. If it's a closing bracket and the stack is not empty, we remove the last opening bracket from the stack. At the end, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, that means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so we return True. Otherwise, we return False.
