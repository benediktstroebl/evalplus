In this script, we use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When we encounter an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack, and when we encounter a closing bracket, we pop the corresponding opening bracket from the stack. If we ever try to pop an opening bracket from an empty stack, that means there's no corresponding closing bracket, so we return False. If the stack is empty after iterating over the entire string, that means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so we return True.
