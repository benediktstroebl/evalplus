In this script, we use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so we return False. Otherwise, we pop the opening bracket from the stack. After processing all brackets, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so we return True.
