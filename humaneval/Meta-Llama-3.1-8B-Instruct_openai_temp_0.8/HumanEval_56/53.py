### Correct Bracketing Function
```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    Check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
    brackets (str): A string of "<" and ">".

    Returns:
    bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the balance between "<" and ">"
    balance = 0
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for bracket in brackets:
        # If the character is an opening bracket, increment the balance
        if bracket == "<":
            balance += 1
        # If the character is a closing bracket, decrement the balance
        elif bracket == ">":
            balance -= 1
        # If the balance becomes negative, there are more closing brackets than opening brackets
        if balance < 0:
            return False
    # If the balance is not zero at the end, there are more opening brackets than closing brackets
    return balance == 0

# Test cases
print(correct_bracketing("<"))  # False
print(correct_bracketing("<>"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("<<><>>"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("><<>"))  # False
```

This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of `<` and `>` characters as input and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a counter to keep track of the balance between opening and closing brackets, and returns `False` as soon as it encounters a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket or an opening bracket without a corresponding closing bracket. The test cases demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs.
