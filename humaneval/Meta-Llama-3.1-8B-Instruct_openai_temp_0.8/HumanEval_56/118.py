This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack is not an opening bracket. If either of these conditions is true, it immediately returns False. After iterating through the entire string, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is not, this means that there are unmatched opening brackets, so it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.
