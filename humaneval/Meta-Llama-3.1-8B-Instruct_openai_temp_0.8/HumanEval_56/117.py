This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered while iterating over the string. If an opening bracket is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. When a closing bracket is encountered, the opening bracket is popped from the stack. If the stack becomes empty at any point during the iteration, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns True. If the stack is not empty after iterating over the entire string, it means there is an unmatched opening bracket, so the function returns False.
