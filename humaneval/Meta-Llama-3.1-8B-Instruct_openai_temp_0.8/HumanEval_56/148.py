### Correct Bracketing Checker
#### Problem: Check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in a string.

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
    brackets (str): A string consisting of "<" and ">" characters.

    Returns:
    bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """
    if len(brackets) % 2!= 0:  # If the length of the string is odd, there's no pair for the middle character
        return False

    # Initialize a stack to store the opening brackets
    stack = []

    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for bracket in brackets:
        # If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
        if bracket == "<":
            stack.append(bracket)
        # If the character is a closing bracket, check if the stack is empty
        elif bracket == ">":
            # If the stack is empty, there's no corresponding opening bracket, so return False
            if not stack:
                return False
            # If the stack is not empty, pop the opening bracket from the stack
            else:
                stack.pop()

    # After iterating over the entire string, if the stack is empty, all opening brackets had corresponding closing brackets
    # If the stack is not empty, there were some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so return False
    return not stack

if not correct_bracketing("<"):
    print("Test 1 passed")

    print("Test 4 passed")
```

This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, there's no corresponding opening bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. After iterating over the entire string, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, all opening brackets had corresponding closing brackets, so it returns True. If the stack is not empty, there were some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so it returns False.
