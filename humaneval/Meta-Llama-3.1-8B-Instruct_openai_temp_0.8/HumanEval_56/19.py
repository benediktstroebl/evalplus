This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of "<" and ">" as input and returns a boolean indicating whether every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. The function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and checks if the stack is empty after processing all brackets. If the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
