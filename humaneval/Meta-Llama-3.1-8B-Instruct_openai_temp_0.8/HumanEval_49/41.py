This Python script defines a function `modp` that calculates `2^n` modulo `p` and includes doctest-style comments for unit tests. The `pow` function with three arguments is used to efficiently compute the power modulo `p`. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block runs the unit tests when the script is executed directly.
