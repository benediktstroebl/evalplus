### Problem: Check for Close Elements in a List

This script checks if there are any two numbers in a given list that are closer to each other than a specified threshold.

### Code

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.

    Args:
    numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.
    threshold (float): The minimum distance between two numbers to be considered 'close'.

    Returns:
    bool: True if there are any two numbers closer than the threshold, False otherwise.
    """
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort()

    # Iterate over the sorted list and check each pair of adjacent numbers
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        # If the distance between the current number and the previous number is less than the threshold
        if numbers[i] - numbers[i-1] < threshold:
            # Return True immediately, as we've found two numbers that are closer than the threshold
            return True

    # If we've checked all pairs of adjacent numbers and haven't found any that are closer than the threshold
    # Return False
    return False


### Example Usage

print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
```

### Explanation

This script uses a simple sorting-based approach to solve the problem. It first sorts the list of numbers in ascending order. Then, it iterates over the sorted list and checks each pair of adjacent numbers. If it finds a pair of numbers that are closer than the threshold, it immediately returns True. If it checks all pairs of adjacent numbers and doesn't find any that are closer than the threshold, it returns False.

Note that this script has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of elements in the input list. This is because the sort operation is typically implemented using a comparison-based sorting algorithm like Merge Sort or Quick Sort, which have a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case. The subsequent iteration over the sorted list has a time complexity of O(n).
