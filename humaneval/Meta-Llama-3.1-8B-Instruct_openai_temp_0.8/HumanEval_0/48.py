### Close Elements Checker
#### Python Script to Check for Close Elements in a List

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.

    Args:
    numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.
    threshold (float): The maximum allowed difference between two numbers.

    Returns:
    bool: True if any two numbers are closer than the threshold, False otherwise.
    """
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort()

    # Iterate over the sorted list
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        # Check if the difference between the current number and the next one is less than the threshold
        if numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i] < threshold:
            # If yes, return True
            return True

    # If no close elements were found, return False
    return False

# Example usage:
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
```

This script uses a simple and efficient algorithm to check for close elements in the list. It first sorts the list of numbers, then iterates over it, checking the difference between each pair of consecutive numbers. If it finds a pair with a difference less than the threshold, it immediately returns `True`. If it checks all pairs without finding any close elements, it returns `False`.
