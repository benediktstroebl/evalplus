### Python Solution for Finding Close Elements in a List
```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.
        threshold (float): The minimum distance between two numbers to be considered different.

    Returns:
        bool: True if any two numbers are closer than the threshold, False otherwise.
    """
    # Sort the list of numbers
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)

    # Iterate over the sorted list
    for i in range(1, len(sorted_numbers)):
        # Calculate the difference between the current number and the previous one
        difference = sorted_numbers[i] - sorted_numbers[i - 1]
        # If the difference is less than the threshold, return True
        if difference < threshold:
            return True

    # If no pair of numbers was found to be closer than the threshold, return False
    return False


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
    print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
```
This script defines a function `has_close_elements` that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as arguments. It sorts the list of numbers and then iterates over the sorted list to check if any two adjacent numbers are closer than the threshold. If such a pair is found, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The script includes example usage at the end to demonstrate the function's behavior.
