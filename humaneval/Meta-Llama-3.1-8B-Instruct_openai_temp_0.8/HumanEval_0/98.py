### Solution: Checks for Close Elements in a List
#### Problem Description
Checks if in a given list of numbers, any two numbers are closer to each other than a specified threshold.

#### Code
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
    
    Args:
    numbers (List[float]): A list of float numbers.
    threshold (float): The minimum distance between two numbers to be considered as "not close".
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if any two numbers are closer than the threshold, False otherwise.
    """
    
    # Sort the list of numbers to simplify the comparison process
    numbers.sort()
    
    # Iterate over the list with a sliding window of size 2
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        # Check if the difference between the current and the next number is less than the threshold
        if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[i + 1]) < threshold:
            return True
    
    # If no pairs of numbers are found to be closer than the threshold, return False
    return False

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
    print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
```
#### Explanation
1. The `has_close_elements` function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input.
2. It sorts the list to simplify the comparison process.
3. It iterates over the list with a sliding window of size 2, checking if the difference between the current and the next number is less than the threshold.
4. If such a pair is found, the function immediately returns True.
5. If no pairs are found to be closer than the threshold after iterating over the entire list, the function returns False.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of elements in the list. The subsequent iteration over the list has a linear time complexity, making the overall time complexity O(n log n).
