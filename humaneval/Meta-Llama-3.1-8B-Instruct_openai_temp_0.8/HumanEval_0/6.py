### Solution: Detecting Close Elements in a List of Numbers
```markdown
### Problem Description
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.

### Code
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.
        threshold (float): The minimum distance required between two numbers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if any two numbers are closer than the threshold, False otherwise.
    """
    if len(numbers) <= 1:
        # If the list is empty or contains only one element, return False
        return False

    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            # Check if the distance between the current pair of numbers is less than the threshold
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold:
                # If a pair with distance less than the threshold is found, return True
                return True

    # If no pair with distance less than the threshold is found, return False
    return False


### Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
    print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
```
### Explanation
This solution uses a simple two nested loops to check all pairs of numbers in the list. The `abs()` function is used to calculate the absolute difference between each pair of numbers. If the difference is less than the threshold, the function immediately returns `True`. If no such pair is found after checking all pairs, the function returns `False`. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list.
