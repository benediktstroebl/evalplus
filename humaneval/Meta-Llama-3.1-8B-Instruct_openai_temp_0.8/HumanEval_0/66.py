### Close Elements Checker
#### Problem: Check if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.
        threshold (float): The minimum distance between two numbers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if any two numbers are closer than the threshold, False otherwise.
    """
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort()
    
    # Iterate over the sorted list
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        # Check if the difference between the current and next number is less than the threshold
        if numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i] < threshold:
            return True
    
    # If no close elements were found, return False
    return False

# Example use cases
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
```

This script sorts the list of numbers and then checks each pair of adjacent numbers to see if they are closer than the given threshold. If such a pair is found, it immediately returns `True`. If it iterates over the entire list without finding any close elements, it returns `False`.
