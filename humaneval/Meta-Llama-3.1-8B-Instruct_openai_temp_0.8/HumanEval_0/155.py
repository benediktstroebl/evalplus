### Close Elements Checker

#### Problem Statement
Given a list of numbers and a threshold, check if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the given threshold.

#### Solution

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.
        threshold (float): The minimum distance between two numbers to be considered close.

    Returns:
        bool: True if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the given threshold, False otherwise.
    """
    # Sort the list of numbers
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    
    # Iterate over the sorted list and check for close elements
    for i in range(len(sorted_numbers) - 1):
        # If the difference between two adjacent numbers is less than the threshold, return True
        if sorted_numbers[i + 1] - sorted_numbers[i] < threshold:
            return True
    
    # If no close elements are found after iterating over the entire list, return False
    return False

# Example usage
numbers1 = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
threshold1 = 0.5
print(has_close_elements(numbers1, threshold1))  # False

numbers2 = [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
threshold2 = 0.3
print(has_close_elements(numbers2, threshold2))  # True
```

This script uses a sorting-based approach to solve the problem. It first sorts the input list of numbers in ascending order, then iterates over the sorted list, checking the difference between adjacent numbers. If the difference is less than the given threshold at any point, it immediately returns True. If it iterates over the entire list without finding any close elements, it returns False.
