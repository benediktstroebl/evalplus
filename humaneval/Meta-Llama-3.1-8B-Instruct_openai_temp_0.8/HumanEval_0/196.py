### Python Script to Check for Close Elements in a List
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.
        threshold (float): The minimum distance between two numbers to be considered close.

    Returns:
        bool: True if there are any two numbers closer than the threshold, False otherwise.
    """
    # Sort the list of numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort()
    
    # Iterate over the sorted list to check for close elements
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        # Calculate the distance between the current and next number
        distance = numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i]
        
        # If the distance is less than the threshold, return True
        if distance < threshold:
            return True
    
    # If no close elements are found, return False
    return False

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    assert not has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
```

This script defines a function `has_close_elements` that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input. It sorts the list, then iterates over the sorted list to check for any two numbers that are closer than the threshold. If such a pair is found, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The example usage demonstrates the function's behavior with two test cases.
