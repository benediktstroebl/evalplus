### Checking for Close Elements in a List of Numbers
```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.

    Args:
    numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.
    threshold (float): The minimum distance between two numbers to be considered close.

    Returns:
    bool: True if any two numbers are closer than the threshold, False otherwise.
    """
    # Sort the list of numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort()

    # Iterate over the sorted list, considering each number and the next one
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        # Calculate the distance between the current number and the next one
        distance = numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i]

        # If the distance is less than the threshold, return True
        if distance < threshold:
            return True

    # If no close elements were found, return False
    return False


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
    print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
```
This script defines a function `has_close_elements` that takes a list of numbers and a threshold value as input, and returns `True` if any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold, and `False` otherwise. The function sorts the list of numbers and then iterates over it, checking the distance between each pair of adjacent numbers. If the distance is less than the threshold, the function immediately returns `True`. If no close elements are found after checking all pairs of adjacent numbers, the function returns `False`.
