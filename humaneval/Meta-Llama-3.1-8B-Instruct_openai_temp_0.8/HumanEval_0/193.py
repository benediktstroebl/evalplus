Here's a Python script that uses a sleek and straightforward approach to solve the problem:

```markdown
### Problem: Check if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.
        threshold (float): The minimum distance between two numbers to consider them not close.

    Returns:
        bool: True if any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold, False otherwise.
    """
    # Sort the list of numbers
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    
    # Iterate over the sorted list and check if any two consecutive numbers are closer than the threshold
    for i in range(1, len(sorted_numbers)):
        if abs(sorted_numbers[i] - sorted_numbers[i-1]) <= threshold:
            return True
    
    # If no two numbers are found closer than the threshold, return False
    return False

# Example use cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
    print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
```

This script defines a function `has_close_elements` that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input. It first sorts the list of numbers, then iterates over the sorted list to check if any two consecutive numbers are closer than the threshold. If such a pair is found, the function immediately returns `True`. If no such pair is found after iterating over the entire list, the function returns `False`. The example use cases demonstrate the usage of the function with different inputs.
