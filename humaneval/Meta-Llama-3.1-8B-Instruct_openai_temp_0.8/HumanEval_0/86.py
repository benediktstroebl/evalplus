### Close Elements Checker
#### A Python script that checks for close elements in a given list of numbers.

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of numbers to check.
        threshold (float): The minimum distance between two numbers to be considered close.

    Returns:
        bool: True if any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold, False otherwise.
    """
    # Sort the list of numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort()

    # Iterate over the sorted list
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        # Check if the difference between the current number and the next number is less than the threshold
        if numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i] < threshold:
            # If it is, return True immediately
            return True

    # If we've checked all pairs of numbers and haven't found any that are closer than the threshold, return False
    return False

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
    print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
```

This script uses a simple sorting-based approach to check for close elements in the list. It first sorts the list of numbers, then iterates over the sorted list to check the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers. If it finds a pair of numbers that are closer than the given threshold, it returns True immediately. If it checks all pairs of numbers and doesn't find any that are closer than the threshold, it returns False.
