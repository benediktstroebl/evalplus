## has_close_elements Function
### Check if two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.

    Args:
    numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.
    threshold (float): The minimum distance required between two numbers.

    Returns:
    bool: True if two numbers are closer than the threshold, False otherwise.
    """
    # If the list has less than two elements, no two elements can be close
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return False

    # Sort the list to simplify the comparison of adjacent elements
    numbers.sort()

    # Iterate over the sorted list, comparing each element with its adjacent one
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        # If the difference between two adjacent elements is less than the threshold
        if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[i+1]) < threshold:
            # Return True, indicating that two numbers are closer than the threshold
            return True

    # If no two numbers are closer than the threshold after the entire list is checked
    return False


# Example usage:
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
```

This script first checks the length of the input list. If it's less than two, it immediately returns `False`, because it's impossible to find two numbers in the list that are closer than the threshold.

Then, it sorts the list to simplify the comparison of adjacent elements.

Finally, it iterates over the sorted list, comparing each element with its adjacent one. If it finds a pair of numbers whose difference is less than the threshold, it immediately returns `True`.

If it checks the entire list without finding any two numbers that are closer than the threshold, it returns `False`.
