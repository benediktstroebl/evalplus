### Close Elements Checker

Below is a Python script that checks if there are any two elements in a given list of numbers that are closer to each other than a specified threshold.

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.

    Args:
    numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.
    threshold (float): The minimum distance between two numbers to be considered as close.

    Returns:
    bool: True if there are any two numbers closer to each other than the threshold, False otherwise.
    """
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort()

    # Iterate over the sorted list to check for close elements
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        # Calculate the distance between the current and previous numbers
        distance = numbers[i] - numbers[i-1]
        
        # If the distance is less than or equal to the threshold, return True
        if distance <= threshold:
            return True

    # If no close elements are found, return False
    return False

# Example usage:
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
```

This script first sorts the list of numbers to ensure that adjacent elements are compared. It then iterates over the sorted list to check for close elements by calculating the distance between each pair of adjacent elements. If the distance is less than or equal to the threshold, it immediately returns True. If no close elements are found after checking all pairs, it returns False.
