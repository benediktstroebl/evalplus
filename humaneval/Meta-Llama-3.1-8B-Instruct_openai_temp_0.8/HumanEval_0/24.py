### Problem: Check if Two Numbers in a List are Closer than a Given Threshold

#### Solution

We can solve this problem by sorting the list of numbers and then iterating over the list to check if any two adjacent numbers are closer than the given threshold.

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.

    Args:
    - numbers (List[float]): The list of numbers to check.
    - threshold (float): The minimum distance between two numbers.

    Returns:
    - bool: True if any two numbers are closer than the threshold, False otherwise.
    """
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort()
    
    # Iterate over the list to check if any two adjacent numbers are closer than the threshold
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        if numbers[i] - numbers[i - 1] <= threshold:
            return True
    
    # If no two adjacent numbers are closer than the threshold, return False
    return False

### Example Usage

# Test case 1: No two numbers are closer than the threshold
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # Output: False

# Test case 2: Two numbers are closer than the threshold
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # Output: True
```

This script defines a function `has_close_elements` that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input, sorts the list, and then iterates over the list to check if any two adjacent numbers are closer than the threshold. The function returns `True` if any two numbers are closer than the threshold and `False` otherwise. The script also includes example usage of the function to demonstrate its behavior.
