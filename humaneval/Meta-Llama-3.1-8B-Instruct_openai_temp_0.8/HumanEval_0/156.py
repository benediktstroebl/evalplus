Here's a Python script with a function that checks if any two numbers in a list are within a certain threshold of each other.

### Function to Check if Two Numbers are Close Enough

This function checks if there are any two numbers in a given list that are closer to each other than a specified threshold.

#### Code

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.

    Args:
    numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.
    threshold (float): The minimum distance required between two numbers.

    Returns:
    bool: True if any two numbers are within the threshold of each other, False otherwise.

    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    """
    # If the list has less than 2 numbers, there can't be any close elements
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return False

    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort()

    # Iterate over the sorted list
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        # If the difference between the current number and the previous number is less than the threshold
        if numbers[i] - numbers[i - 1] < threshold:
            return True

    # If no close elements were found
    return False

# Example usage
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
```

#### Explanation

This function first checks if there are at least two numbers in the list. If not, it immediately returns False, since there can't be any close elements.

Next, it sorts the list of numbers. This allows us to easily check if any two numbers are close to each other.

Then, it iterates over the sorted list, starting from the second number (at index 1). For each number, it checks if the difference between the current number and the previous number is less than the threshold.

If it finds any two numbers that are within the threshold of each other, it immediately returns True.

If it iterates over the entire list without finding any close elements, it returns False.

This approach ensures that the function has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the list, due to the sorting step.
