**Check for Close Elements in a List of Numbers**
=====================================================

The following Python script defines a function `has_close_elements` to check if there are any two numbers in a given list closer to each other than a specified threshold.

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floating-point numbers.
        threshold (float): The minimum distance between two numbers for them to be considered as close.

    Returns:
        bool: True if there are any two numbers closer to each other than the threshold, False otherwise.
    """
    # Sort the list of numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort()

    # Iterate over the sorted list to check for close elements
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        # Calculate the distance between the current number and the next number
        distance = numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i]

        # If the distance is less than the threshold, return True
        if distance < threshold:
            return True

    # If no close elements are found, return False
    return False

# Example use cases
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
```

This script defines a function `has_close_elements` that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input. It sorts the list in ascending order and then iterates over the sorted list to check for elements that are closer to each other than the threshold. If such elements are found, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The example use cases demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs.
