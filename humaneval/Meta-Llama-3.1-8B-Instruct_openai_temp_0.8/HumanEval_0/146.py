```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.

    Args:
    numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.
    threshold (float): The minimum distance between two numbers to be considered close.

    Returns:
    bool: True if any two numbers are closer to each other than the given threshold, False otherwise.

    Example:
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    """
    numbers.sort()  # Sort the list of numbers in ascending order
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        # Check if the difference between the current number and the next number is less than the threshold
        if numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i] < threshold:
            return True
    return False  # If no close elements are found, return False

# Test the function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # Should print: False

```
This script uses the built-in `sort` method to sort the list of numbers in ascending order. Then it iterates over the sorted list and checks if the difference between each number and the next number is less than the given threshold. If such a pair is found, the function immediately returns `True`. If no such pair is found after iterating over the entire list, the function returns `False`.
