### Problem Solution: Checking Close Elements in a List of Numbers

This script defines a function `has_close_elements` that checks if any two numbers in a given list are closer to each other than a specified threshold.

#### Code

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.

    Args:
    numbers (List[float]): The list of numbers to check.
    threshold (float): The minimum distance between two numbers to be considered "close".

    Returns:
    bool: True if any two numbers are closer than the threshold, False otherwise.
    """
    # Sort the list of numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort()

    # Iterate over the sorted list
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        # Calculate the distance between the current number and the previous number
        distance = numbers[i] - numbers[i - 1]
        
        # If the distance is less than the threshold, return True
        if distance < threshold:
            return True

    # If no pairs of numbers are closer than the threshold, return False
    return False


# Example usage:
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
```

#### Explanation

This script first sorts the list of numbers in ascending order. Then, it iterates over the sorted list, calculating the distance between each pair of adjacent numbers. If it finds a pair of numbers with a distance less than the threshold, it immediately returns True. If it iterates over the entire list without finding any such pair, it returns False. This approach ensures that the function has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the length of the input list.
