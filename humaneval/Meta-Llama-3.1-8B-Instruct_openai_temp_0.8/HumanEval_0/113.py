### Checking for Close Elements in a List of Numbers
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.

    Args:
    numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.
    threshold (float): The minimum distance required between any two numbers.

    Returns:
    bool: True if any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold, False otherwise.
    """
    # Sort the list of numbers to make it easier to compare adjacent elements
    numbers.sort()
    
    # Iterate over the sorted list, and check each pair of adjacent elements
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        # If the difference between two adjacent elements is less than the threshold, return True
        if numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i] < threshold:
            return True
    
    # If no pair of adjacent elements is closer than the threshold, return False
    return False

# Example usage:
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
```
In this code, we first sort the list of numbers to make it easier to compare adjacent elements. Then, we iterate over the sorted list, checking each pair of adjacent elements. If we find a pair whose difference is less than the threshold, we immediately return `True`. If we finish the iteration without finding such a pair, we return `False`.
