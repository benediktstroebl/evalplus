## Close Elements Detector

The following Python script defines a function `has_close_elements` that checks if any two numbers in a given list are closer to each other than a specified threshold.

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.

    Args:
    numbers (List[float]): List of floating point numbers to check.
    threshold (float): Minimum distance between two numbers to be considered 'close'.

    Returns:
    bool: True if any two numbers are closer to each other than the threshold, False otherwise.
    """
    # Sort the list of numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort()

    # Iterate over the sorted list
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        # Calculate the distance between the current and previous numbers
        distance = numbers[i] - numbers[i - 1]
        # If the distance is less than the threshold, return True
        if distance < threshold:
            return True

    # If no close elements were found, return False
    return False

# Example usage:
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
```

This script defines the `has_close_elements` function with type hints for the input list of numbers and the threshold value. The function sorts the list of numbers and then iterates over it to check if any two adjacent numbers are closer than the specified threshold. If such numbers are found, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The script includes example usage at the end to demonstrate the function's behavior.
