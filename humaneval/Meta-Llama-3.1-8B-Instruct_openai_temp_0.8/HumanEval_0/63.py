### Solution: Checking for Close Elements in a List
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): List of float numbers
        threshold (float): The minimum distance required between numbers

    Returns:
        bool: True if two numbers are closer than the threshold, False otherwise
    """
    # Sort the list of numbers to easily compare adjacent elements
    numbers.sort()

    # Iterate over the sorted list, considering each pair of adjacent elements
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        # Calculate the absolute difference between adjacent elements
        difference = abs(numbers[i] - numbers[i - 1])

        # If the difference is less than the threshold, return True
        if difference < threshold:
            return True

    # If no pair of adjacent elements is closer than the threshold, return False
    return False

# Example usage
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
```
This script uses a simple sorting approach to solve the problem efficiently. It first sorts the list of numbers, then iterates over the sorted list, comparing each pair of adjacent elements. If it finds a pair with a difference less than the threshold, it immediately returns `True`. If it doesn't find any such pair after checking all adjacent elements, it returns `False`.
