### Problem: Check if two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold
#### Solution

Here's a Python function that solves the problem:

```markdown
### Code

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floating-point numbers.
        threshold (float): The minimum distance between two numbers to be considered "far enough".

    Returns:
        bool: True if any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold, False otherwise.
    """

    # Sort the list in ascending order
    numbers.sort()

    # Iterate over the sorted list to check the distance between each pair of adjacent numbers
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        # If the distance between two adjacent numbers is less than the threshold, return True
        if numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i] < threshold:
            return True

    # If no pair of numbers is closer than the threshold, return False
    return False
```

### Example Usage

```markdown
### Example usage of the has_close_elements function

# Test case 1: No two numbers closer than the threshold
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
threshold = 0.5
print(has_close_elements(numbers, threshold))  # Output: False

# Test case 2: Two numbers closer than the threshold
numbers = [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
threshold = 0.3
print(has_close_elements(numbers, threshold))  # Output: True
```

This solution works by first sorting the list of numbers in ascending order. Then, it iterates over the sorted list to check the distance between each pair of adjacent numbers. If the distance is less than the given threshold, it immediately returns `True`. If it checks all pairs of numbers without finding any that are closer than the threshold, it returns `False`.
