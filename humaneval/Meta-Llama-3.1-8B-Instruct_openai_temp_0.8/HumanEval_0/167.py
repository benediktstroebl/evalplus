### Checking for Close Elements in a List
#### Problem Description
Check if in a given list of numbers, any two numbers are closer to each other than a specified threshold.

#### Code Solution
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.
        threshold (float): The minimum distance between two numbers to be considered close.

    Returns:
        bool: True if any two numbers are closer than the threshold, False otherwise.
    """
    # Create a set to store the numbers we have seen so far
    seen = set()
    
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort()
    
    # Iterate over the sorted list
    for num in numbers:
        # For each number, calculate the range of values that could be considered close
        close_range = (num - threshold, num + threshold)
        
        # Check if any number in the close range has been seen before
        for seen_num in seen:
            if seen_num in close_range:
                # If a number in the close range has been seen before, return True
                return True
        
        # Add the current number to the set of seen numbers
        seen.add(num)
    
    # If we have checked all numbers and haven't found any pair that is close, return False
    return False

# Example usage:
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
```

This script defines a function `has_close_elements` that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and returns `True` if any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold, and `False` otherwise. It uses a set to keep track of the numbers it has seen so far, and sorts the list of numbers before iterating over it. For each number, it checks if any number in the close range has been seen before. If it finds any pair that is close, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
