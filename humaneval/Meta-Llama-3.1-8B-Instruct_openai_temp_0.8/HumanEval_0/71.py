### Checking for Close Elements in a List of Numbers
#### Code
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.

    Args:
    numbers (List[float]): The list of numbers to check.
    threshold (float): The minimum distance between two numbers to be considered close.

    Returns:
    bool: True if any two numbers are closer than the threshold, False otherwise.
    """
    # Sort the list of numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort()

    # Iterate over the sorted list, comparing each pair of adjacent numbers
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        # If the difference between the current number and the previous one is less than the threshold
        if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[i - 1]) < threshold:
            # Return True, indicating that two numbers are closer than the threshold
            return True

    # If the loop completes without finding any close numbers, return False
    return False

# Example use cases:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
    print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
```

#### Explanation
This Python function `has_close_elements` takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and checks if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the given threshold.

1.  The list of numbers is first sorted in ascending order using the `sort()` method. This allows for efficient comparison of adjacent numbers.
2.  The function then iterates over the sorted list, starting from the second number (at index 1).
3.  For each pair of adjacent numbers, it calculates the absolute difference between them using the `abs()` function.
4.  If the difference is less than the threshold, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that two numbers are closer than the threshold.
5.  If the loop completes without finding any close numbers, the function returns `False`.
