## Check if two elements in a list are closer than a specified threshold

Here's a Python function to check if any two numbers in a given list are closer than a specified threshold.

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.

    Args:
    numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.
    threshold (float): The minimum distance required between any two numbers.

    Returns:
    bool: True if any two numbers are closer than the threshold, False otherwise.
    """
    # Sort the list of numbers
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    
    # Iterate over the sorted list to check for close elements
    for i in range(len(sorted_numbers) - 1):
        # Calculate the difference between the current and next number
        difference = sorted_numbers[i + 1] - sorted_numbers[i]
        
        # If the difference is less than the threshold, return True
        if difference < threshold:
            return True
    
    # If no close elements are found, return False
    return False

# Example usage:
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
```

This function first sorts the list of numbers in ascending order. Then, it iterates over the sorted list, calculating the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers. If it finds a pair with a difference less than the threshold, it immediately returns True. If it checks all pairs without finding any close elements, it returns False.
