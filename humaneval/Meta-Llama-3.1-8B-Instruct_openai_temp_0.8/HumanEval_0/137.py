### Close Elements Checker

The following Python script checks if any two elements in a given list of numbers are closer to each other than a specified threshold.

```markdown
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.

    Args:
    numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.
    threshold (float): The minimum distance between two elements.

    Returns:
    bool: True if any two elements are closer than the threshold, False otherwise.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    """

    # Sort the list of numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort()

    # Initialize a variable to store the previous number
    prev_num = numbers[0]

    # Iterate over the sorted list of numbers starting from the second number
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        # If the absolute difference between the current number and the previous number is less than the threshold
        if abs(num - prev_num) < threshold:
            # Return True, indicating that two elements are closer than the threshold
            return True
        # Update the previous number for the next iteration
        prev_num = num

    # If the loop completes without finding any two elements closer than the threshold, return False
    return False

# Example usage:
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
```

This script uses a simple sorting approach to find any two elements in the list that are closer to each other than the given threshold. The time complexity of this approach is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the number of elements in the list.
