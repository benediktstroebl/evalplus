### Close Elements Checker
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.
        threshold (float): The minimum distance between two numbers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if any two numbers are closer than the threshold, False otherwise.
    """
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold:
                return True
    return False

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
    print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
```

This script defines a function `has_close_elements` that checks if any two numbers in the given list are closer to each other than the specified threshold. It does this by iterating over the list of numbers, comparing each pair of numbers, and returning `True` as soon as it finds a pair that meets the condition. If no such pair is found after checking all pairs, it returns `False`.
