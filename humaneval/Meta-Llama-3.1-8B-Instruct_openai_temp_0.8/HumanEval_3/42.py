### Below Zero Balance Detector
#### Problem Description
Given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with zero balance,
detect if at any point the balance of account falls below zero.

#### Solution
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Detect if at any point the balance of account falls below zero.

    Args:
    operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the balance falls below zero at any point, False otherwise.
    """
    
    # Initialize balance to 0
    balance = 0
    
    # Iterate over each operation in the list
    for operation in operations:
        # Add the operation to the balance
        balance += operation
        
        # If the balance falls below 0, return True
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    
    # If the function hasn't returned True by now, the balance never fell below 0
    return False

# Test cases
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
print(below_zero([-1, -2, -3]))  # True
print(below_zero([5, 5, 5]))  # False
```
This script defines the `below_zero` function, which takes a list of operations as input and returns `True` if the balance ever falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a simple iterative approach to keep track of the current balance and checks if it falls below zero after each operation.
