Here is a Python script that solves the problem:
```markdown
### Solution: Below Zero Balance

This script checks if the balance of a bank account falls below zero at any point in time.

#### Code

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if the balance of a bank account falls below zero at any point in time.

    Args:
        operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the balance falls below zero, False otherwise.
    """
    balance = 0  # Initialize the balance to zero
    for operation in operations:  # Iterate over each operation
        balance += operation  # Update the balance by adding the operation
        if balance < 0:  # Check if the balance falls below zero
            return True  # Return True if it does
    return False  # Return False if the balance never falls below zero

# Example usage:
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
```

#### Explanation

This script uses a simple iterative approach to solve the problem. It initializes the balance to zero and then iterates over each operation in the list. For each operation, it updates the balance by adding the operation. If the balance ever falls below zero, it immediately returns True. If it iterates over all operations without the balance falling below zero, it returns False.

This script has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations, because it iterates over each operation once. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the balance.
