### Solving the Problem: Below Zero Balance Detection
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Detects if a bank account balance falls below zero at any point.

    Args:
    operations (List[int]): A list of deposit (positive) and withdrawal (negative) operations.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the balance falls below zero, False otherwise.
    """
    balance = 0  # Initialize balance to zero
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation  # Update balance after each operation
        if balance < 0:  # Check if balance falls below zero
            return True  # Return True as soon as balance falls below zero
    return False  # Return False if no below-zero balance detected

# Example usage:
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
```

This Python script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of deposit and withdrawal operations as input. It initializes the balance to zero and iterates over the operations, updating the balance after each operation. If the balance falls below zero at any point, the function immediately returns `True`. If no below-zero balance is detected after all operations, the function returns `False`. The script also includes example usage to demonstrate the function's behavior.
