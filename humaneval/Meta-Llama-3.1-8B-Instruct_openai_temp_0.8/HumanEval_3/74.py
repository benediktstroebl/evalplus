### Bank Account Balance Checker
#### Problem Description
You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with 
zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account falls below zero, 
and at that point function should return True. Otherwise it should return False.

#### Solution
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if the balance of a bank account falls below zero at any point.

    Args:
    operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the balance falls below zero, False otherwise.
    """
    balance = 0  # Initialize the balance to zero
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation  # Update the balance after each operation
        if balance < 0:  # Check if the balance falls below zero
            return True  # Return True if the balance falls below zero
    return False  # Return False if the balance never falls below zero

# Example usage:
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
```
This script solves the problem by iterating over the list of operations, updating the balance after each operation, and checking if the balance falls below zero. If it does, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
