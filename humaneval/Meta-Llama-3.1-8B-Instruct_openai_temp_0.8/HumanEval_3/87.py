# Below Zero Balance Detector
================================

A Python script that detects if a bank account balance falls below zero due to a series of deposit and withdrawal operations.

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Detects if a bank account balance falls below zero due to a series of deposit and withdrawal operations.

    Args:
    operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account, where positive numbers represent deposit and negative numbers represent withdrawal.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the balance of account falls below zero at any point, False otherwise.
    """
    balance = 0  # Initialize the account balance to zero
    
    for operation in operations:  # Iterate over each operation in the list
        balance += operation  # Update the balance by adding the current operation
        if balance < 0:  # Check if the balance falls below zero
            return True  # Return True if the balance falls below zero
    
    return False  # Return False if the balance never falls below zero

# Example usage
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False, balance remains positive
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True, balance falls below zero
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the balance falls below zero at any point. It initializes the balance to zero and iterates over each operation, updating the balance and checking for negative values. If a negative balance is detected, it returns True immediately. If the loop completes without detecting a negative balance, it returns False. The example usage demonstrates the function's behavior with different input lists.
