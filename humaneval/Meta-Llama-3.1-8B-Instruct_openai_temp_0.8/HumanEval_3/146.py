### Solution
Here's a simple Python script that solves the given problem. This script checks if the account balance falls below zero at any point.

```markdown
### below_zero.py

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    This function checks if the account balance falls below zero at any point.

    Args:
    operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the account balance falls below zero at any point, False otherwise.
    """
    balance = 0  # Initialize the balance to zero
    for operation in operations:  # Iterate over each operation
        balance += operation  # Update the balance
        if balance < 0:  # Check if the balance falls below zero
            return True  # If it does, return True
    return False  # If no operation causes the balance to fall below zero, return False


# Test the function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # Should print False
    print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Should print True
```

### Explanation
This script initializes the account balance to zero. It then iterates over each operation in the list. For each operation, it updates the balance by adding the operation amount. If the balance falls below zero at any point, it immediately returns `True`. If it iterates over all operations without the balance falling below zero, it returns `False`. 

The script also includes a `main` guard to ensure the test cases are run only when the script is executed directly, not when it's imported as a module. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations, because it needs to iterate over all operations once. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the balance.
