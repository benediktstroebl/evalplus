### Below Zero Balance Detection

The following Python script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations on a bank account and returns `True` if the balance ever falls below zero, and `False` otherwise.

```markdown
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Detects if the balance of a bank account falls below zero at any point.

    Args:
    operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations.
        Positive values represent deposits and negative values represent withdrawals.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the balance falls below zero at any point, False otherwise.
    """
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False

# Example usage:
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
print(below_zero([1, -1]))  # True
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # False
```

This script initializes the balance to zero and iterates over the list of operations. For each operation, it adds the operation value to the balance. If the balance ever falls below zero, it immediately returns `True`. If it iterates over all operations without the balance falling below zero, it returns `False`. The example usage demonstrates the function's behavior with different inputs.
