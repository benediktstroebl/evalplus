```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Detects if at any point the balance of a bank account falls below zero.

    Args:
    operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the balance falls below zero, False otherwise.
    """
    
    # Initialize the balance to 0
    balance = 0
    
    # Iterate over each operation in the list
    for operation in operations:
        # Update the balance by adding the current operation
        balance += operation
        
        # If the balance falls below 0, return True
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    
    # If the function hasn't returned True by now, the balance never fell below 0, so return False
    return False

# Test cases
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations as input and returns `True` if the balance falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a simple iterative approach to update the balance and check for the condition. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs.
