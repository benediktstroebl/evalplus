### Bank Account Balance Below Zero Detector

This script detects if a bank account balance falls below zero at any point given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations.

#### Code
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Detects if a bank account balance falls below zero at any point given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations.

    Args:
        operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the balance falls below zero at any point, False otherwise.
    """
    balance = 0  # Initialize the balance to zero
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation  # Update the balance based on the operation
        if balance < 0:  # Check if the balance falls below zero
            return True  # Return True if the balance falls below zero
    return False  # Return False if the balance never falls below zero

# Example usage
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Output: True
```
#### Explanation

This script uses a simple iterative approach to detect if a bank account balance falls below zero. It initializes a balance to zero and updates it based on each operation in the list. If the balance falls below zero at any point, it immediately returns True. If it iterates through all operations without the balance falling below zero, it returns False.

#### Advice

This script has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations, making it efficient for large lists of operations. However, it assumes that the input list is valid and does not contain any non-integer values. If the input list can contain invalid values, you may want to add error checking code to handle such cases.
