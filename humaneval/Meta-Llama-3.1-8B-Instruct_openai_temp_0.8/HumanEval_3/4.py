### Bank Account Balance Checker
#### Problem: Detect if Bank Account Balance Falls Below Zero

Below is a Python script that solves the problem using a simple iterative approach.

```markdown
### Code
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    This function checks if at any point the balance of an account falls below zero.
    
    Args:
    operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if the balance falls below zero at any point, False otherwise.
    """
    balance = 0  # Initialize the balance to 0
    
    for operation in operations:  # Iterate over each operation in the list
        balance += operation  # Add the operation to the balance
    
        if balance < 0:  # Check if the balance falls below zero
            return True  # Return True if the balance falls below zero
    
    return False  # If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, return False

### Example Use Cases
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
```

### Explanation

1. We initialize the balance to 0.
2. We iterate over each operation in the list.
3. For each operation, we add it to the balance.
4. We check if the balance falls below zero. If it does, we return True.
5. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, we return False.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations, and a space complexity of O(1) since we only use a constant amount of space to store the balance.
