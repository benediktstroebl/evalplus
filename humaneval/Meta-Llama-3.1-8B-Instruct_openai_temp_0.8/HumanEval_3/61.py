    You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fallls below zero, 
    and at that point function should return True. Otherwise it should return False.

    Args:
        operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the balance of account falls below zero, False otherwise.

    balance = 0  # Initialize the balance to zero
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation  # Update the balance after each operation
        if balance < 0:  # Check if the balance falls below zero
            return True  # Return True if the balance falls below zero
    return False  # Return False if the balance never falls below zero

# Test cases

print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations as input and returns `True` if at any point the balance falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. The function initializes the balance to zero, updates the balance after each operation, and checks if the balance falls below zero. If it does, the function returns `True`. If it doesn't after processing all operations, the function returns `False`. The script includes test cases to verify the correctness of the function.
