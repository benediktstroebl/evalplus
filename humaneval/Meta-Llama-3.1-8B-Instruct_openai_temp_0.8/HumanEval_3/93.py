### Bank Account Balance Checker
#### Problem: Detect if Bank Account Balance Falls Below Zero

Below is a Python script that solves the problem. This script defines a function `below_zero` that checks if a bank account balance falls below zero given a list of operations.

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if bank account balance falls below zero given a list of operations.
    
    Args:
    operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if balance falls below zero at any point, False otherwise.
    """
    balance = 0  # Initialize balance to zero
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation  # Update balance after each operation
        if balance < 0:  # Check if balance falls below zero
            return True  # If balance falls below zero, return True
    return False  # If no operation causes balance to fall below zero, return False

# Test cases
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # Expected output: False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Expected output: True
```

This script works by initializing the balance to zero and then iterating over each operation in the list. After each operation, it checks if the balance falls below zero. If it does, it immediately returns True. If it iterates over all operations without finding a balance below zero, it returns False.
