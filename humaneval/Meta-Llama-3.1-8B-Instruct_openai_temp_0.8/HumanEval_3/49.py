### Detecting Balance Below Zero in Bank Account Operations

Below is a Python script that solves the problem using an iterator to keep track of the balance at each operation.

```python
from typing import List
import itertools


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    This function detects if the balance of a bank account falls below zero at any point given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations.

    Args:
    operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the balance falls below zero at any point, False otherwise.
    """
    # Use itertools.accumulate to calculate the running balance
    balance = itertools.accumulate(operations, initial=0)
    
    # Use next to get the first balance and check if it's below zero
    return next((balance_value < 0 for balance_value in balance), False)


# Test cases
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
```

This script uses the `itertools.accumulate` function to calculate the running balance at each operation. The `initial` argument is used to start the balance at 0. Then, we use the `next` function with a generator expression to check if any of the balance values are below zero. If a balance is below zero, the function immediately returns `True`. If no balance is below zero, the `next` function will return `False`.
