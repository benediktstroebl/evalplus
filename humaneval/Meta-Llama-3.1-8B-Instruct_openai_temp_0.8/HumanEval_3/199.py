### Bank Account Balance Tracker

#### Problem Description

This script solves the problem of detecting whether the balance of a bank account falls below zero at any point given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations.

#### Code
```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Detects if the balance of a bank account falls below zero at any point given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations.

    Args:
        operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the balance falls below zero at any point, False otherwise.
    """
    balance = 0  # Initialize balance to zero
    
    # Iterate over each operation in the list
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation  # Update balance by adding the current operation
        
        # If balance falls below zero, return True
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    
    # If no operation causes balance to fall below zero, return False
    return False


# Example usage:
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
```

#### Explanation

This script uses a simple iterative approach to track the balance of the bank account. It initializes the balance to zero and then iterates over each operation in the list. For each operation, it updates the balance by adding the current operation and checks if the balance falls below zero. If it does, it immediately returns True. If no operation causes the balance to fall below zero, it returns False after iterating over all operations.
