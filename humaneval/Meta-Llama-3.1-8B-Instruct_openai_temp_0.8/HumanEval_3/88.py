### Solution: Detecting a Bank Account Balance Below Zero

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    This function checks if at any point the balance of a bank account falls below zero.

    Args:
    operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the balance falls below zero at any point, False otherwise.
    """
    
    # Initialize the balance to zero
    balance = 0
    
    # Iterate over each operation in the list
    for operation in operations:
        # Update the balance by adding the current operation
        balance += operation
        
        # If the balance falls below zero, return True
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    
    # If the loop completes without finding a balance below zero, return False
    return False

# Example usage:
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations as input and returns `True` if the balance falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a simple iterative approach to update the balance and check for a negative balance. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with different lists of operations.
