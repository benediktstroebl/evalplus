### Bank Account Balance Below Zero Detection

This script solves the problem of detecting if a bank account balance falls below zero at any point given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations.

#### Code
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Detects if at any point the balance of account falls below zero.

    Args:
    operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account.

    Returns:
    bool: True if at any point the balance falls below zero, False otherwise.
    """
    balance = 0  # initialize balance to zero
    for operation in operations:  # iterate over each operation
        balance += operation  # update balance
        if balance < 0:  # check if balance falls below zero
            return True  # return True if balance falls below zero
    return False  # return False if no operation causes balance to fall below zero

# Example usage:
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
```

#### Explanation

This script uses a simple iterative approach to solve the problem. It initializes a `balance` variable to zero and then iterates over each operation in the list. For each operation, it updates the `balance` by adding the operation amount. After each update, it checks if the `balance` has fallen below zero. If it has, it immediately returns `True`. If it iterates over all operations without the `balance` falling below zero, it returns `False`.
