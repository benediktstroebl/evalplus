### Below Zero Balance Detector

This script contains a function `below_zero` that takes a list of deposit and withdrawal operations
as input and returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise.

### Code
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    This function detects if at any point the balance of account falls below zero.

    Args:
    operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the balance falls below zero at any point, False otherwise.
    """
    balance = 0  # Initialize the balance to zero
    for operation in operations:  # Iterate over each operation
        balance += operation  # Update the balance by adding the current operation
        if balance < 0:  # Check if the balance falls below zero
            return True  # Return True if the balance falls below zero
    return False  # Return False if the balance never falls below zero
```

### Example Usage
```python
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
```
```
### Explanation

The `below_zero` function takes a list of deposit and withdrawal operations as input and returns `True`
if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a
simple iteration over the operations, updating the balance by adding each operation. It checks if the
balance falls below zero after each operation and returns `True` if it does. If the function completes
the iteration without finding a balance below zero, it returns `False`.
