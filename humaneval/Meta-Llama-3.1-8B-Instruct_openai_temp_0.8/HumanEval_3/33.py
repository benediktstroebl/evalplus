### Detecting a Balance Below Zero in a Bank Account
```markdown
## Problem Description
You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with zero balance.
Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account falls below zero.

## Solution

Here's a Python function that accomplishes this task:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Detects if at any point the balance of account falls below zero.

    Args:
        operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the balance falls below zero at any point, False otherwise.
    """
    balance = 0  # Initialize the balance to 0

    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation  # Update the balance with each operation

        # If the balance falls below zero, return True
        if balance < 0:
            return True

    # If no operation caused the balance to fall below zero, return False
    return False

# Example usage:
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
```
This solution initializes the balance to 0 and then iterates through each operation, updating the balance accordingly. As soon as the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns True. If no operation causes the balance to fall below zero, it returns False.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of operations. This is because it only needs to iterate through each operation once to determine if the balance falls below zero.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the balance.
